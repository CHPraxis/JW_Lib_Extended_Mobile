<p><span class="font10">YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH is the One to whom all praise is due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who recognize this and do praise him will never depart from his organization. The Almighty God is directing the affairs of his covenant people through his Faithful and Wise Servant who is now at His temple. It is manifest to all thinking persons that there are two great organizations: one working in the interests of righteousness and the other in the interests of wickedness. Jehovah is the Righteous Ruler and the Supreme One. The Devil is the wicked ruler and will not recognize nor submit himself to the rule of the Most High. The Devil has questioned the supremacy of Jehovah as the Ruler of the universe. The question of world domination is yet to be settled to the satisfaction of all creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For approximately six thousand years Jehovah has allowed Satan to remain. His reason for allowing him to remain and rule the affairs of this earth is stated at Exodus 9:16. There the record shows Jehovah addressing Pharaoh, Satan’s representative of the first world power, and declaring that he permitted Satan to remain and attack His representatives, or faithful servants, so that Jehovah might show his power over Satan and, further, that Jehovah might have His name and Word proclaimed throughout all the earth. Throughout this long period of time Jehovah has proved that he can place men on earth who will maintain their integrity, even though the Devil, with all his organization, visible and invisible, tries to turn such creatures</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">away from the Almighty God. It has been Satan’s claim that creatures serve God only for a selfish purpose. This was his argument in the case of Job. This argument has been proved false so many times, as recorded in the Bible, that now it is no longer a case of argument, but a case of stubborn action on the part of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Revelation 12 it is pointed out that now the Devil knows that his time is short. He has been given sufficient time to prove his side of the argument. Shortly now Jehovah will prove His supremacy by the complete destruction of the entire organization built up by the Devil, both visible and invisible, as well as by casting the Devil himself into the bottomless pit.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THE FIGHT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Ever since Lucifer saw his chance for world domination and rebelled against God he has tried to establish an organization that would bring into subjection to his will every creature. His management of earth’s affairs under his control from the time of Adam up to Noah came to an end when Jehovah, through his mighty power manifested in the Flood, cleaned out all wickedness from the face of the earth. The Scriptures tell us that the “world that then was” was overflowed by water and destroyed. This destruction primarily affected earthly representatives of the Devil’s organization, because every vestige of his rule was wiped out in that disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil’s invisible hosts were immediately reorganized under his direction, he knowing that if he was ever to secure himself as the dictator of the world he would have to have a much more powerful organization than that which he had developed. As we look back through history we see that all peoples have been regimented under the oppressive whip of the rulers. At times some rulers came into power over governments of earth that had principles based on righteousness and justice, but almost all of these nations in due time succumbed to totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Flood, beginning with Babylon the Devil set up his first world empire. This organization, established for world domination, was under the leadership of Nimrod. Many world empires rose and fell, all under the direct supervision of the Devil and his invisible demons. It can be seen that the Devil has been given many a chance and has taken upon himself all the opportunities possible to establish a world-wide government over which he would have world domination. At no time has he ever been able to establish a government that would keep perpetual control. We have seen the fall of the world empires of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and many other nations out after world conquest. Even though it appeared at times that the Devil had brought into submission all men, there have always been some who would not submit to his regimentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout these many generations Jehovah God has had upon the earth His witnesses. Sometimes there were not very many, but there were always some here to hold high the standard of the Lord. Out of all the nations of the earth Jehovah had chosen the Israelites, lie did not choose them because they were the greatest of all people, the most intelligent, the greatest warriors, the “purest blood”, but he chose them because he had made a covenant with his friend, Abraham, who was the father of these Israelites. It is only because Jehovah God made a promise that “in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed” that he chose the Jewish people to represent him, and through them set up a Theocratic arrangement in the earth. Many of the Israelites recognized the grave responsibility placed upon them and the great honor of being representatives of the Lord and his witnesses. The 11th chapter of Hebrews sets forth the activities of many of these witnesses. The books of the Bible originally written in Hebrew give the detailed account of the faithfulness of the prophets and prophetesses, and judges and kings; and further show how the religious organizations that the Devil had set up round about the Promised Land tried to take into their organizations the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not until 606 B.C. was the Devil’s totalitarian regime able to take under his control all the peoples of the earth. This did not mean, however, that God did not have witnesses on the earth; even though his servants were enslaved in Babylon. Fearless prophets and faithful men stood up and would not compromise with the totalitarian arrangements. As examples, we have Daniel and the three faithful Hebrew children, and others, who, while working for the government, were not a part of it. Not for one minute would they compromise; for they had made a covenant with God to serve him and honor his name. Satan brought upon them great persecution, distress, perplexity, and that in some instances to the point of death. Though the Devil through his agents has used every form of torture conceivable he has not been able to turn the faithful and true witnesses of the Lord aside.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>FAITHFULNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At the time that Christ was upon the earth it seemed as though Satan had been making great strides in establishing world control and he had, through the Roman Empire, practically brought under his domination all nations, peoples and tongues. The arrival of Jesus upon the scene brought great anxiety to the Devil, for here appeared something that might interrupt his plans. At the birth of Jesus, through the wicked king Herod, he arranged for the killing of all babes two years old and under at Bethlehem, to be sure to include the babe Jesus. He was fighting against God; but Jehovah had decreed that His Son would come to the age of manhood and there be put on his own as far as integrity is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the age of 30, after Jesus was baptized in Jordan, he went up into the wilderness, and there the Devil appeared unto him. Satan offered to the Lord Jesus at that time all the kingdoms of this world. The Devil knew that he was running things in the earth according to his will and without interference or interruption on the part of Jehovah God, and he saw here the Seed of Promise that in due time would interfere with that world rule that he was trying to establish, not only on earth, but eventually in heaven. Jesus would have nothing to do with Satan, but came into the wilderness to meditate upon the Lord’s Word and to be directed in the course that he should follow. The Devil, being very angry, tried time and time again to destroy Jesus, and brought upon Jesus great persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus had always been obedient to his heavenly Father before he took upon himself the form of man, but in this obedience in heaven with his Father there was no persecution, envy, strife, tribulation, wicked machinations, or anything to deter or turn away the Son from the heavenly Father. The Devil’s claim is that creatures serve Jehovah God for what they get out of it, but here Christ Jesus takes upon himself the form of a man and as such proves faithful, true, and loyal to his heavenly Father under stress, under the most severe persecution that was ever brought to bear against any creature; and even with this proved faithful and true, maintained his integrity, and, as the Scriptures say, learned obedience by the things which he suffered. Here again the Devil lost in trying to turn away from God a creature who had made up his mind to serve the Almighty and praise His name. The teachings of Christ Jesus were so powerful, true and just that all persons who heard these truths and who were seeking meekness and righteousness followed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It appeared to the religionists of that time that if this one, Jesus, continued to preach the whole nation would be turned to him and the Roman Empire, which was then established in Palestine, would take away their place of honor and power. The religionists have always served the Devil, and the main foundation of all governmental rule has religion as its base and backing. The Devil, through his dupes, finally succeeded in destroying Jesus, as he thought, by putting him to death ; but the facts show that Jesus was raised from the dead and received all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of his faithfulness unto his heavenly Father against adverse conditions he was the one chosen to be the King of the righteous Government that God from the very beginning and through all His holy prophets promised would be established upon the earth. Here, then, was the primary arrangement for the kingdom that would ultimately overthrow and clean out the wicked rule of the Devil and in its place establish a glorious rule whose God is Jehovah, the kingdom wherein righteousness will rule and those who love peace and prosperity will have their portion filled to overflowing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>MORE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after the death of Jesus and his resurrection a great preaching work was begun by the apostles and those who followed Jesus when upon the earth. The holy spirit was poured out, this being the promised comforter to those faithful servants after Jesus left them. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus preached from city to city and from house to house, in villages, in the country, in the temple and synagogues, wherever they had opportunity to talk to the common people; and these heard gladly. In one day three thousand turned away from the religious practices and followed the teachings of Christ Jesus and became Jehovah’s witnesses. This continued until in the early days many thousands associated themselves with the organization that represented Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus. The greater this organization grew, the greater became the persecution; for here was something that was opposed to the Devil’s totalitarian world domination. It represented opposition to the Devil’s rule, and if allowed to proceed it might mean the final downfall of the Devil and his organization. The Devil went forth to destroy and has tried to destroy all persons who have loved righteousness and have followed the teachings of Christ Jesus. Despite this “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14) have been gathered out of the Gentiles and remain blameless. The Devil failed, and therefore proved again to be a liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest setback to the Devil’s organization since the time of the Flood was in 1914, when the Devil was cast out of heaven and down to the earth. Now the time had come for the final settling of the issue as to who is supreme, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil. Who will be supreme ruler of the world? Jehovah or the Devil? Due to the casting down to the earth of the Devil and all his wicked hosts, great wrath has been brought upon the peoples of the earth. This has continued from 1914 up until the present time, and there has been upon the earth tribulation such as the world has never known, and which will undoubtedly become greater. The Devil knows that the time has come for a final showdown, and therefore he is out to destroy everything opposed to his rule. The ones he is trying to destroy would be those who are for the rule of Christ Jesus through the kingdom that He said would be established and for which Christians have prayed, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is only one thing the Devil can do, and that is what he is doing: trying to establish upon the earth a world-wide empire. Shortly after the first world war ended there was set up a League of Nations, which League it was hoped would bring about a world government under the direction of the League of Nations. This was his first move to again establish totalitarian rule world-wide. This was the “abomination of desolation” spoken of by Daniel that he was trying to set up. It did not succeed in its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the whole world is again engaged in war, a global war, and it is determined by all of the rulers, whether those fighting on the Axis side or those on the side of the United Nations, that when this war ends there will be a united government of all nations. This setup is described in the 17th chapter of Revelation. When this “beast”, as the revelator calls it, reappears it will amaze all the peoples of the earth and cause them to wonder; for it will be a government world-wide, and therefore the rulers who direct the affairs of this worldwide government will say “Peace and safety”. The dominant factor in that rule will be religion. The Devil’s woman, Babylon, or, in other words, his religious organization, is going to ride that great beast which has seven heads and ten horns, according to the Scriptures at Revelation 17; and she will exercise guiding influence over the nations of the earth. This will be the pinnacle of the Devil’s organization scheme to regiment all the people and bring them into his power, either to rule or to ruin. In this he shall fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil knows that Christ Jesus is upon His throne and has taken unto himself His great power and has begun to reign, and he further knows that his own time is short. (Rev. 12:12) The Devil is fully cognizant of the fact that Christ Jesus has been enthroned and that now the time has come when Jehovah God will show forth His power. For many centuries the Devil has gone ahead uninterrupted in his rule and has tried to solidify his gains, and now he is making the last desperate effort to bring all peoples into subjection unto his rule, both in heaven and in earth, to make a stand ready for the final battle, the battle of Armageddon. The revelator sets forth a clear picture of this gathering, “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”—Rev. 16:14.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>THE WARNING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The followers of Christ Jesus have been commissioned to preach this gospel of the Kingdom and give due warning concerning the impending destruction that is just ahead. Jehovah’s witnesses have done just this. All of Jehovah’s witnesses from the time of Abel down to the present time have had the opportunity of proving true and faithful to their heavenly Father, representing Him in the earth and giving a good report. They have followed Jehovah’s commandments. They have done His will and not their own. Because of remaining blameless in their day and maintaining their integrity, the Devil has always sought to destroy them. These facts are recorded in God’s Word, the Bible, and while they were true in the times of the faithful men of old and in the time of Christ Jesus and in the times of the apostles, even so in this time it is true that the Devil would destroy all those who are proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and are the representatives of the Most High in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The contest that is waged is not between individuals, but is between worlds, the world of the Devil’s organization, both visible and invisible, and the new world of which Christ Jesus is King with universal power. The showdown is near. Before that time, however, a great witness must be given, so that those persons who love righteousness may have an opportunity to take a stand on the right side. So many have been blinded by the false teachings of the existing wicked organizations and held under the dominating influence of totalitarian rule that they have not had the opportunity to see and ro hear the precious promises of the Lord and what his Government will bring to them. Therefore this gospel of the Kingdom has been preached and will continue to be preached until the cities be wasted and the houses are without inhabitants. This is an assignment that is given those who already have the information concerning the full establishment of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who have taken the course of preaching this gospel of the Kingdom and standing foursquare for the Government of righteousness as against the totalitarian rule of the Devil must expect that the Devil will try to destroy them and interfere in every way possible with the teachings that they are heralding forth at this time. It is no easy task to be a Christian, a witness for Jehovah. It was not an easy task in the time of the apostles, nor is it easy now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To prove that it is the purpose of the Devil to separate us from the love of God, the account is set out in Romans 8 to this effect, at verse 35, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword ?” The final answer is, Nothing; for in the 37th verse it is stated, “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to tribulation separating us from the love of Christ, the apostle, in Acts 14: 22, states that “we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God”. We have assurance that while going through this tribulation we shall be comforted and helped; for we read, in 2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4, “Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.” At no time will the servant of the Lord be forsaken, but he will be aided so that he can maintain his integrity. Even though a servant of the Lord be in great distress, this would be no cause for him to forsake Christ. The promise is given us by the Lord, “For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.”—Isa. 25: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persecution will not deter one nor turn him aside. One properly taught in the Scriptures and having studied the Word of God will know that the servant is no better than his master. They can exclaim, “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matt. 5:12) The 11th chapter of Hebrews shows how they persecuted the prophets and how the prophets endured under stoning, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of lire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to Hight the armies of the aliens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The course the Christians have taken is not an easy one. They follow in the footsteps of the Master and they must do as he stated: “Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.”—John 15 : 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have stood up under all kinds of persecution today, not only in the totalitarian lands, but also in the lands governed by democratic rule. The only reason for this persecution is that they state the truth concerning the present conditions of the world and what will be the outcome, showing the people that God’s Kingdom is the only hope of the world. In Germany and totalitarian-dominated countries Jehovah’s witnesses are thrown into concentration camps; they are starved; many have been shot, others jailed; children have been separated from their parents, husbands from their wives. In some countries there have been mob attacks made on Jehovah’s witnesses merely for the preaching of the gospel. In many democratic countries the officials, chiefs of police, policemen, sheriffs, judges, and others, give no assistance to Jehovah’s witnesses nor protect their rights of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. These conditions exist in supposedly Christian nations. Does this condition of persecution ever separate them from the love of Christ? It does not, but as the apostle Paul stated, “Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.” (2 Cor. 4:9) So determined are Jehovah’s witnesses to remain true and steadfast that neither famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor the sword, separates them from the love of Christ.—Ps. 71:18-20; Matt. 25: 36; 2 Cor. 11: 2326; Acts 12:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle Paul goes on with the argument, in Romans 8, “As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” It is in defense of Jehovah’s name and Word that the Lord’s people stand up against this adversity and against the Devil and his entire organization and are killed all the day long. The name of the Lord is involved, on this issue: Can Jehovah place on earth people who will maintain their integrity? Jehovah’s witnesses have taken up this challenge of the Lord and will not forsake it. Therefore, for the sake of the name of Jehovah they continue true and steadfast in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom against all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Knowing that the Devil is out to rule or ruin, and particularly to destroy those who are faithful and true witnesses; the Lord’s people are counted as sheep for the slaughter. We have the sure Word of God, however, that in some instances the Devil might be able to destroy the body; but not the soul. He cannot destroy the endless existence of the follower of Christ Jesus and who is serving for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. The Devil is determined and puts forth every effort to keep the truth away from the people; for he knows that those who have a measure of meekness and righteousness in their hearts will follow the truth when they hear it. It is for fear that he cannot keep all people under his dominant power and prove his part of the false charge that men will not serve God except for a selfish reason that the Devil has brought tribulation, distress, persecution, peril and the sword against the servants of the Most High. However, regardless of all this persecution Jehovah’s witnesses are assured that “in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us”. There is no question about the final outcome of this matter. The Devil’s organization will go down, no matter how strong he builds it up in these last days. Even though he succeeds in establishing another world power with such strength, the Scriptures plainly state that it will go down. In its stead will be made world-wide the Government of Christ, which has no end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses, and especially their Leader, Christ Jesus, are the most valiant, most determined creatures ever to live upon the earth. The apostle Paul says, “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”—Rom. 8: 38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No matter what is brought to bear against any of the servants of the Lord, no matter in what country they are, no matter what regimentation is established by totalitarian rulers, no matter how harsh the treatment in concentration camps, no matter how unjust the judges, no matter how great the mob violence, persecution will be defeated. Jehovah’s witnesses will not give up the cause. They will stand true and steadfast and continue to preach this gospel of the Kingdom until the very end, even though death be the toll. Jehovah’s witnesses have nothing to fear; they will come off victorious. The Devil and his crowd and all of his agents and nations have everything to fear, because they are bound to lose; and that is why the Devil goes forth now with great wrath, seeking whom he may destroy. The apostle tells us, “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15: 57, 58) In the mind of a Christian there is no question as to the outcome. They have the sure word of prophecy, “We are more than conquerors.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>ORDAINED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">These followers of the Lord, who have chosen to follow a course the same as he did when he was upon the earth, are ordained ministers of the gospel. A man docs not represent God because some creature says he is God’s representative. The only way anyone could determine who are ordained of God is to judge them by their works. The Lord Jesus said, ‘By their works ye shall know them.’ The apostle James brings to our attention that faith without works is dead, but that James would show persons his faith by his works. Therefore ordination cannot come by man, but the commission to serve the Almighty is received from Him through His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The commission is very definite and clear and is set forth by the prophet Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) It is not necessary for an individual to go to some theological school or seminary in order to be an ordained minister. Surely none of the clergy today fulfill the commission nor do they have the knowledge of God's Word such as Peter and John did, of whom it is stated that they were “unlearned and ignorant men”. (Acts 4:13) Those who have made a covenant with God and consecrated their lives to serve Him must of necessity follow out the commandments laid down by the Lord Jesus. One of these is stated in Luke 9: 60: “Go thou and preach the kingdom of God.” It is because of these plain, clear statements that every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, whether man or woman, whether young or old, goes forth and proclaims the message of the Kingdom from house to house. Acts 2:16,18 shows that the spirit of God is poured out upon all flesh, and the sons and daughters shall prophesy, and the young men see visions. It is stated, “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!” Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate their responsibilities and are grateful to the Lord for the privilege of honoring His name in this day among the distressed peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From among Jehovah’s witnesses the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society appoints special representatives to look after the interests of its work in various lands. These men have proved by their works and by their understanding of the Bible that they are ordained ministers of the gospel and have received the divine ordination and commission of authority to represent Jehovah God. They having received this ordination of Jehovah, the Society recognizes such as ordained ministers and appoints them to preach this gospel of the Kingdom and to look after specific duties assigned them in the United States and other nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many other ordained ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses whose names are not listed in this year’s report, but those that are listed are specially equipped to look after their ministerial duties at the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society or its branches or as traveling evangelists.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">More than sixty years ago a small group of people in western Pennsylvania, having a knowledge of the Scriptures and not having gone to any theological schools, saw the importance of sharing in the preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom and bringing to the people the truths as explained in the Bible and not by religion. Religion, failing to be abreast of the times and to keep close to the Word of the Lord, but rather following the traditions, has failed. Therefore, in 1884, this little body of Christian people organized a corporation under the name of Zion’s Watchtower Society. A few years later this name was changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, that now being its corporate name under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the early years of the twentieth century the principal offices of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the Pennsylvania corporation, were moved to New York city as a matter of convenience so as to carry on better the world-wide organization that had been developed by that time. In 1908 there was organized for the purpose of carrying on legal business in the State of New York the Peoples Pulpit Association, a corporation organized under the religious membership corporation laws of the State of New York. Later the name of this corporation was changed to Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Branches of the Society having been established in countries other than the United States and progressing very well, it was thought best to start a corporation in England. In 1914 the International Bible Students Association was created and organized under the laws of Great Britain. The purposes of these three corporate bodies are exactly the same. The purposes of the corporations as announced in their charters are the same. All corporations function as one, and their interests are “the dissemination of Bible truths by means of publication in printed form and other lawful means”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses use these instruments, or corporate bodies, to carry on the work of witnessing to God’s kingdom throughout all parts of the earth. These corporations are charitable and benevolent, because the people who use these organizations to carry on the work are moved by love and unselfish devotion to Jehovah God and his Kingdom to carry on such work. These corporations operate offices, from which point the general direction of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses is handled, as well as printing plants, radio stations, storage depots, schools and institutions for housing those persons working at the above-named establishments. All persons employed at the main offices of the Society, whether it be the head office or some branch, work there voluntarily. No one receives any pecuniary gain, but, for example, at the Brooklyn headquarters, where upward of 200 persons are engaged in work at the printing plant and the home that cares for these people, each one receives an allowance of $10 a month, as well as his board and room. The same arrangement is in operation at all other property operated by the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>TRAINING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">All ordained ministers of the gospel must study to show themselves approved unto God and therefore must have training in the Word of the Lord. Provision has been made by the Society to give such instruction to those making a covenant to do the Lord’s will. In all cities where there is a group of Jehovah’s witnesses there is organized a company. This group of Jehovah’s witnesses meets regularly several times each week and engages in very careful study of the Scriptures. The Watchtower Society provides these groups with publications for study. Not only are the books and magazines provided for their careful consideration, but question books have been printed to guide the students. Numerous Bible helps are also distributed by the Society to aid these companies in their local studies. Each of these studies is opened with prayer and the study is carried on in an orderly manner under a competent conductor appointed by the Society. Persons attending these studies are real students of the Scriptures and they follow the apostle’s admonition, “Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.” (2 Tim. 2:1, 2) These students appreciate the responsibility of gaining knowledge so that they may be able to tell others also so that they too may take a stand for the Kingdom. These studies are open to all persons of good-will desirous of knowing more about the Scriptures and the teachings of our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These students of the Scriptures who attend the regular meetings of the Society in the various cities not only study to gain greater knowledge concerning the Word of the Lord, but also conduct studies throughout the cities and rural communities among the people of good-will in their homes. The importance and good work done by these studies will be set out later in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the Bethel Home, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, where there are upward of 200 students of the Bible, there is carried on, in addition to the many studies such as all companies throughout the United States conduct, an advanced course in Theocratic ministry. The young men enrolled in this school are given a thorough training in public speaking, all public speaking being on Bible subjects. The course includes the study of various translations of the Bible, and the use of concordances and Bible dictionaries, and takes up a careful study on Bible history and Bible characters, proper diction, pronunciation, and preparation of a talk. Many other subjects are treated in these class studies. All students are given the opportunity to deliver lectures, as well as write treatises on various subjects, all of which are submitted to the instructors of the school. This advanced course in Theocratic ministry has proved most profitable and helpful to all students. All the students in the school are ordained ministers and are regularly conducting Bible studies in homes, and many serve regular congregations in various parts of the country and cities, from New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE COLLEGE OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the school at the Bethel Home, which carries on an advanced course in Theocratic ministry, the Society has arranged to open up a college on its property at South Lansing, New York, where there is operated a Kingdom farm, which Kingdom farm raises foodstuffs principally for the Bethel family, and which provisions are trucked in to New York. Others are canned during the summer for winter use. Recently the Society erected a large building called “Gilead”, meaning “heap of witness”; and arrangements are now nearly completed for the establishment of the Watchtower Bible College there. The purpose of the college will be to prepare men and women for missionary work in all parts of the world as teachers and instructors in the Bible and Bible literature. Those eligible for a course in this school will be ministers who are devoting their whole time to the work, namely, special pioneer publishers or pioneer publishers, with a minimum requirement of at least two years of activity and experience in the field. Those attending this school are selected by the Society from the enrollment list of pioneers. Those ministers of the gospel who seem best qualified for work in foreign lands will be called in to this school, their expenses all being paid, and they will be put through a five-month course of study for five hours a day. Courses of study will be of the Bible, its teachings, and Bible history; a course in public speaking, Theocratic organization instructions, how to organize new companies and direct their worship of Almighty God, taking care of branch work, seeing to the publication and distribution of Bibles and Bible literature; a course in bookkeeping, English grammar, and languages, international law, and the study of the constitutions of various countries to which places the graduates may be sent. During each semester of five months approximately 100 students will take the course outlined and he prepared to go to any place that the Society may wish to send them. Only such ordained ministers as are willing to go anywhere in the world to preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness will be privileged to attend the Watchtower Bible College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Students, on Sundays, will devote full time to the field-service work in the vicinity of the college. Any extra time the students may have they will spend assisting in the work on the farm which surrounds the college, so as to provide food for themselves and for the Bethel family. It is hoped that, by the Lord’s grace, at least 200 students can be sent forth from this school each year to various parts of the world to carry on the work of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and advancing its interests in other lands. Those ordained ministers chosen by the Society for this advanced course of study will, we feel sure, greatly appreciate the privilege of attending this school and receive a further assignment of privileges of service wherever the Lord may lead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>MANNER OF PREACHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The religious form of preaching today is much different from that outlined in the Bible. There have been set up throughout all the countries of the world large cathedrals and so-called “churches”, to which places the preachers ask their congregations to come so that the clergy might talk to them. What a change from the methods used by Christ Jesus and the apostles! They did not build temples of stone, but rather the Lord Jesus went from city to city and from house to house, from village to village, and preached where-ever he had the opportunity. It is true the apostles came together and met in an upper room to study with the Lord Jesus when in Jerusalem. The church formed after Christ’s resurrection came together in halls or some meeting-place or at homes and studied the word of the Lord and the Scriptures. But all of these were commissioned by the Lord Jesus to preach the gospel of the Kingdom, and the manner of preaching is set out in the Scriptures. “And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also.” (Mark 1:38) Again, “And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him.”—Luke 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is further shown that preaching was done not only in the villages and towns publicly, but from house to house: “And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” (Acts 2:46,47) This was the method that Jehovah’s witnesses used and still use. While Jehovah’s witnesses have company organizations and halls or homes in which they assemble and invite the people for very careful study of the Scriptures, at the same time each individual claiming to be a servant of the Most High goes from place to place and from house to house, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, so that those who have not heard may have the opportunity of hearing. Jehovah’s witnesses try to make it convenient for the other person to hear this message of the Kingdom. If they have an ear to hear, the Lord says “Let them hear”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Jehovah’s witnesses prepare themselves and fit themselves for preaching the gospel by word of mouth, thus having their schools in the companies and at Bethel and Gilead, they also have provisions to aid in preaching the gospel, such as bound books, magazines, pamphlets, leaflets, Bibles, phonograph records, and phonographs on which to run these records for the benefit of the people hearing the Bible talks contained on the records; Bible studies are arranged and conducted at the homes; and the radio has been used extensively in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In fact, every means that can be used to convey to other persons knowledge and the truths contained in the Bible, these have been used, by the Lord’s grace. None of this activity is carried on for making merchandise of the truth. In fact, millions of pieces of literature are given away free each year, and in general the cost of production and distribution exceeds the total amount of contributions accepted from persons taking the literature and willing to contribute toward publishing and circulating more literature. Hence the work is in no aspect commercial, but is gospel-preaching, and hence is an expression of the worship or service of Almighty God. Against such, no human law is valid. It is because of using every avenue of communication that Jehovah’s witnesses have been persecuted so in the last several years; however, this does not deter them, but they are more determined than ever to move ahead with the proclamation of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The principal offices of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society are located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. From these offices the work in the United States and throughout all the world is directed. Reports are received regularly from all branches, depots, farms, factories, and all the institutions under the direct supervision of the Society. The work of all three corporations (which are really one in purpose), namely, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society (Pennsylvania corporation), the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. (New York corporation), and the International Bible Students Association, of Britain, is the same—that of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. Therefore the work of all three corporations is managed and directed from the principal offices in Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On January 8, 1942, the former president of the Society, J. F. Rutherford, finished his earthly course; and because of his faithful service, making his calling and election sure, he now has greater privileges of service in association with Christ Jesus, the King, in his heavenly position. It was thought by many, particularly the religionists of today, that when the administration of the Society’s affairs fell into the hands of someone other than J. F. Rutherford the Society and its work would be on the decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religionists can work only on the theories set forth by their tradition. In their organizations everything is based on men and what men have done; and therefore when one man leaves their organization and another takes his place they wonder if he will be better or worse than the former administrator. If the religionists really had faith that their organizations were of God, then they would give God and His Son, Christ Jesus, the credit for directing the affairs of their organizations; but this they fail to do. They put their trust in men; which leads into a snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses recognize Jehovah God and His Son, Christ Jesus, as the Higher Powers, and have full faith that Christ Jesus, now being in his temple, is directing the affairs of the Society. Jehovah’s witnesses therefore expected no change as to progress or operation, but rather believed that the work would continue on without a hitch; and the year’s report proves this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religionists would do well to follow the advice of Gamaliel as recorded at Acts 5:38, 39: “And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.” It appears, however, that the religionists are aware that this organization is of God, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">which it is,</span><span class="font6"> and therefore they continue to persecute and put forth every effort possible to destroy the organization that has God’s blessing, thus deliberately fighting against God. They think to frighten Jehovah’s witnesses into inactivity to prevent them from entering the Kingdom. (Matt. 23:13) Jehovah’s witnesses, interested only in honoring Jehovah’s name and proclaiming the message of the Kingdom, fear nothing man may do. They know that nothing that is formed against them shall prosper, and nothing can be done that will stop the onward march of Christ’s Kingdom, which began in 1914. The New World, in which dwelleth righteousness, will continue to grow until it fills the whole earth. It is not dependent upon any man or group of men. Those who have the great privilege of looking after the interests of the Kingdom, with joy and gladness follow under the direction of Christ Jesus and none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The factory and general offices of the Society are located at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York. Each one there has his work to do and does it gladly. In order to accomplish the work that was done there during the past year, it required more men than at any time heretofore, there being an average of 161 brethren working regularly throughout the year, to compare with the 154 last year. So great was the volume of work to be turned out that it required much extra time to accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In former years it had always been arranged to close the factory and home for a period of two weeks so the brethren could get outside of the city to engage in the field service, and get some rest from their regular routine. While a similar arrangement was made, at no time was the factory closed down, because the vacation period was spread out over a period of two months. Twenty-five percent of the brethren took their vacation at a time, over a four-period duration. This proved very satisfactory; it kept the wheels of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">machinery turning constantly. In addition to this, however, it was necessary to work 128 evenings, extra time 2| hours, as well as 20 Saturday afternoons, 4 hours each. With this schedule of work the report shows that the greatest number of hours ever devoted to manufacturing in the factory, and the taking care of the office work done there, was put in during the last fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While an average of 161 persons worked in the factory and office, there was other work to be done by 52 individuals taking care of the Bethel home, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, and Watchtower (Staten Island) gardens, and radio station. Those working at the Bethel home take care of the rooms occupied by all the brethren living there, provide the meals, can food, operate their own laundry, tailor shop, shoe repair shop, and attend to general maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Watchtower (Staten Island), gardens are well taken care of and food grown for the use of the Bethel family only. During the year 3,337 bushels of vegetables were raised. All of this was served on the Bethel tables or canned during the year. The canning report shows that there were 34,913 quarts of food canned for winter use. At Staten Island a small chicken farm is operated along with the farm gardening work, and this department was able to provide 12,231 dozen eggs as well as 7,077 pounds of chicken for the family. In addition to this farm on Staten Island, which also houses the radio station equipment of WBBR, large quantities of food are brought into the Bethel home from Kingdom Farm, located at South Lansing, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kingdom Farm is merely the name given to the hundreds of acres of farmland that are kept under cultivation. The Society does not operate any other farms throughout the country. At Kingdom Farm, South Lansing, the Watchtower school is also conducted for the benefit of those brethren there, and the same advanced course in Theocratic ministry is taken there by these ordained ministers as at the Bethel home. Since the construction of Gilead (the name of the main building), this farm will provide the location for the Watchtower Bible College, and each year, it is hoped, several hundred students, ministers of the gospel, will be brought into that school to be given further training for their missionary work. It will take large quantities of food to feed all the persons who will be living at Gilead, as well as fill the requirements for the Bethel family of New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>BETH-SARIM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Built in 1929, at San Diego, California, the house named Beth-Sarim has been the focal point of much enemy ridicule because it was deeded to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Jephthah, and other righteous men of old whom God has promised to make “princes” in His New World. Much publicity has been given to Beth-Sarim, Society property, due to naming it Beth-Sarim, which means “house of the princes”, in expectation of the resurrection of these faithful men of old to be “princes in all the earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was at this home that Brother Rutherford, the former president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, finished his earthly course of life, on January 8,1942. Immediately thereafter considerable publicity was again given the home. It was the wish of the former president to be buried on this property, but the “city fathers”, along with the religionists, put up a great howl. The details of the controversy will be found in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> No. 592.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of good-will in San Diego showed their desire to have Judge Rutherford’s wishes complied with, by 14,693 of them signing a petition, but their desires were ignored. By the circulation of this petition a real witness was given in this territory for a period of months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren living at Beth-Sarim and on property adjoining thereto look after the interests of the Kingdom at that place. A course of study is conducted there similar to that at the Bethel home, under the direction of a competent instructor. Seven brethren that live there and take care of the property spend a great portion of their time in the field service, organizing study groups and caring for the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These provisions of the Lord—the Watchtower farm on Staten Island and the Kingdom farm at South Lansing, New York—make it possible for those working in New York city preparing the publications to have good food, and thus be enabled to carry on their strenuous duties. All of this provision reflects on the good production shown in this year’s report from the 117 Adams Street office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A greater amount of printing was done in the factory at 117 Adams Street than was done during the previous year. This is proved by the fact that approximately 200 tons more paper went through our presses than in the former year. While the grand totals of finished products do not equal those of last year, this is due to the fact that we used our presses for the publication of more bound books and Bibles than at any time heretofore. The production of bound books increased by more than a half million. Production of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> increased by more than 1,800,000 copies, and of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> by over 800,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two of the outstanding features in the production at the factory during the past year were, first, the publication of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font6"> on rotary presses (12,128 of these were produced), and, second, the production of the first complete Bible ever printed on the Society’s rotary presses, with a production of 39,420. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-glott</span><span class="font6"> is a publication of over 900 pages; and the Bible, of over 1,150 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the 3,062,737 bound books completed, 2,094,000 of these were the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font6"> and 488,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font6"> The brethren working on these publications rejoice in the great privilege extended to them by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the factory was producing Bibles, books, magazines and booklets at capacity speed, many other announcements concerning the Kingdom were produced, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font6"> handbills, and miscellaneous job printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Details on production, to compare with the previous year, are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The above products were printed in 15 different languages, and represent 57 different books or booklets in addition to the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The supplies used in production are indicative of the tremendous amount of work accomplished. 2,785 tons of paper, 162 tons of chipboard, 292,731 yards of cloth, in addition to many other supplies, were needed to complete books, booklets and magazines. At the plant at 117 Adams Street we manufactured our own paste, making and using 112 barrels; we made our own glue, using 14,195 pounds. The ink manufacture totaled 47,979 pounds. To keep our buildings in repair, it was necessary to produce 482 gallons of paint and 250 pounds of putty. It is becoming more difficult daily to obtain supplies. A diligent effort has been put forth throughout the year to keep the supplies coming in, so that the message of the Kingdom could be reproduced in printed form for the blessing of the “other sheep”. Jehovah has blessed our efforts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>NEW MACHINERY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Some new machinery was required during the year to keep up with the constant pace and the wearing out of old machines. A new rounder and backer was required for the bookbinding department, which was obtained after many months of delay. Early in the year a truck was purchased for our depot at St. Louis, Missouri. A new Revolvator was also necessary for the handling of paper rolls. This is a hand-power elevator which is used for stacking up the heavy rolls of paper, on top of one another.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The past year was a splendid year in the shipments of literature, but it did not come up to the previous year as to the number of books and booklets sent out from the Brooklyn factory. One reason for this is that shipping of literature to foreign countries was practically at a standstill. The Society has many orders on hand, and the shipments all ready to be sent to foreign countries just as soon as we can obtain the space. Ocean-going vessels come under government control and those things most needed in the war effort take priority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1941 upward of 6,600,000 pieces of literature were shipped to foreign branches, to compare with this year's total of 1,354,000 books and booklets shipped out. Last year’s total of over 6,000,000 would have been surpassed had we been able to get shipping space. Many of our foreign branches are running low on literature because of no shipments moving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were a few new publications released for the first time during the year: the new Watchtower Bible, containing a concordance and other valuable information; a 384-page bound book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World;</span><span class="font6"> and the 1942 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses.</span><span class="font6"> Booklets released and distributed for the first time were </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hope </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font6"> Another very helpful publication was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Children” Study Questions</span><span class="font6"> booklet. In addition to handling and shipping all these books, booklets, and Bibles, the mailing of the millions of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> magazines in several languages entailed a tremendous amount of work. The shipping costs alone for all these publications—books, booklets, magazines, etc.—amounted to $181,772.80 for the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Included with the dispatch of literature was a large number of recordings, the grand total being 323,122 discs, containing lectures about God’s kingdom. It was possible during the year, also, to complete and ship 4,222 vertical-type phonographs, all of which are being put to very good use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the above shipments are due to orders received at the Adams Street office, which entails the handling of mail incoming, 319,150 pieces, and letters or cards dispatched, 301,500.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>SERVICE IN THE FIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful followers of Christ Jesus delight to serve God. Jehovah’s witnesses see that the world, as it exists today, holds out no hope or comfort for the people. It is because of this that they have left the world and have taken their stand definitely on the side of the King and the Kingdom. They have taken up the commission of preaching the gospel and teaching others the Word of God. It is because they are following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, and teaching His doctrine, that they are hated of the world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17 :14) This may seem very odd to some, but it is true. Just because the Lord Jesus had given them Jehovah’s Word, which is the 'sword of the spirit’, the Bible, the world hates them. However, when one understands what is occurring in the world today, that an old world is moving out and the New World is coming in, and that there is a fight on between the Devil and his organization and the Supreme Power, Jehovah, and His glorious organization, one appreciates why these servants of the Lord are hated. “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” —John 15:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Determined to be true and faithful unto the Lord, the servants of God in the United States have moved forward with great zeal. The greatest period of witnessing ever performed in this country was accomplished during the year 1942. The publishers cannot control the distribution of literature. This depends on whether or not they can get the publications and whether or not the people can obtain them. But there are three things a publisher of the Kingdom can control. They are (1) being a publisher, getting out into the field service, (2) putting in time in witnessing for the Kingdom, namely, hours devoted to the proclamation of the name of God, and (3) making back-calls on those persons whom he finds interested as he goes from place to place. In regularity in these three features, and others too, the witnesses of the Lord in the United States stand out prominently. Never before had there been such consistent activity on the part of the publishers. The peak of publishers reached during the year was 64,995. The average for the year, that is, the number of publishers in the field service every month, was 62,179. This shows their consistent effort. This is, on the average, an increase, too, over the proceeding year, of 5,434 publishers engaging in the field service every month. Remarkable is the time that these publishers devoted to the field work. The grand total of 18,240,938 hours were devoted in the proclamation of the Kingdom. This is an increase of 25 percent over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming now to the back-call activity, of looking well to the interests of the “other sheep”, we find that these publishers made 4,525,982 back-calls, which was an increase of 56 percent over the previous year. This is a good barometer as indicating the seriousness with which the brethren are taking hold of their Kingdom responsibilities. The detailed report which follows will show what good work was done in the other fields of service activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The distribution of bound books was 428,000 greater than that of the previous year. There were 29,000 more new subscriptions obtained for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> 1,250,000 more magazines were distributed in the street work by the publishers than last year, bringing the grand total distributed in field service to 7,479,710 copies. They used their sound equipment extensively during the year, increasing that activity over the previous year. Persons hearing the various lectures totaled to 10,016,699. All of this indicates the great effort put forth by the publishers in the United States to magnify the name of the Lord and to advance the Kingdom interests. This was not accomplished by easy going. It was not carrying on the Kingdom work the same as previous years, but against far greater opposition than ever manifested in times previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we read The Acts of the Apostles and the experiences of those who were with Christ, we see how the early church was persecuted by the religionists, how the work was oppressed, and how every effort was put forth to destroy it. Current conditions are very similar to those in that time. Every one must bear his own burden, and this Jehovah’s servants do gladly. They have accepted their responsibilities, and have proved definitely that they are not following any man, but are looking to Christ Jesus to direct the affairs of His people now. The report of the publishers in the field proves this, and it is set out herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Whether the servants of Jehovah are in the ranks of the special pioneer publishers, general pioneers, or company publishers, whether they be in a large organization or a small, they still appreciate that they are all working to the one end, that is, preaching this gospel of the Kingdom and aiding the “other sheep” before the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant of the “little flock” still on earth appreciate their responsibility. The “other sheep” “which are not of this fold” know too that as Jephthah’s daughter did they must likewise maintain their integrity in offering themselves to the Lord at Uis temple and remain faithful and true witnesses of the Lord. Therefore these faithful servants of God stand shoulder to shoulder in the proclamation of the Kingdom. While the remnant on earth is on the decrease, we find the “other sheep” being brought into the organization and on the increase. The Memorial report for 1942 shows that there were 83,894 in attendance at the Memorial service in the United States, and that there were only 13,131 who partook of the emblems. These brethren, who are looking well to the interests of the Kingdom and taking on the greater burden of the work, can be found in all branches of the service, as special pioneer publishers, pioneers, or company publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The responsibility of magnifying the Lord’s name and looking after the interests of the Kingdom is the same upon all; there is no distinction. It is their privilege to fulfill their commission before the Lord, and to aid the “other sheep” to carry on the ‘fishing’ and ‘hunting<sup>5</sup> work, and show these persons who seek meekness and righteousness the one safe place to be when the battle of Armageddon strikes. All, at unison, are doing this.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>SPECIAL PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the fiscal year the Society organized a new work. It was organized under the name of “special pioneer publishers”, and when it began there were 784 brethren reporting for this field of service. It has grown and expanded until now it has reached a total of 1,578 special pioneer publishers reporting each month. These brethren have maintained a splendid record in the field service even though great opposition has been brought to bear against them in many parts of the country. As a group they have been very consistent in their activity, averaging 175 hours a month in the field service, which is a requirement, and also conducting more than 50 back-calls and arranging for studies in the publications of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that less than 2 percent of the publishers in the United States, which they represent, put in more than 12 percent of the hours, make 17 percent of the back-calls, and place 13 percent of all the literature, in the country. They are working hard; whether it is cold or warm, whether it is wet or dry, in season and out of season they continue to proclaim the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These special pioneer publishers work in groups and are assigned cities in various parts of the United States where there are no companies. There they find the people of good-will and organize them into a group that can study the Word of the Lord and eventually serve the Kingdom interests in that territory. During the past year there were 259 cities completed; that is, the special publishers have gone over that territory at least four times. The new companies organized by these pioneer publishers during the year totaled 244. It is expected that during the coming year the present special pioneer publishers will accomplish much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In some of these small towns, dominated by fanatical religionists and rulers who do not recognize the Constitution and often say that the Constitution of the United States doesn’t apply to their city or town, mob violence has broken out and disrupted the work of the special pioneers. In 35 cities in the United States it was impossible to complete their work of witnessing, due to mob violence. Mississippi stands out as the principal state in violation of constitutional privileges. Nine cities in that state alone were abandoned because of mob violence. Texas came next, with six cities driving out Jehovah’s witnesses. We are advised in the Word of the Lord that when you can no longer work in a town, then shake the dust off your feet and leave. (Matt. 10:23) It may be some time later that other publishers can return and reach the people of goodwill. The publishers that left these cities controlled by violence and dictator policies did not leave at the first little skirmish, but put forth every effort possible to stay and, finding it absolutely impossible to work, had to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These special pioneer publishers are aided considerably by the Society because of the nature of their activity. It necessitates carrying on many book studies, which takes a lot of time. On the average during the year, each week these special pioneer publishers were able to conduct 5,593 book studies, with an average attendance weekly of 13,960. It is hoped that during the coming year better results will be attained, although these are excellent. To aid these special publishers, the Society gave them assistance to the amount of $187,315.46. It was possible to aid these brethren because of the splendid contributions made on the part of the company publishers throughout the United States to the Good Hopes fund of the Society. The Society is grateful that it can assist these brethren and advance the Kingdom interests in this country to that extent. The special publishers have also expressed their gratitude for this assistance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>GENERAL PIONEER PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the fact that the entire 1,500 special pioneer publishers were taken from the ranks of the general pioneers, this branch of the service shows an average monthly increase of 421. You will note in the report that there were, on the average, 4,204 regular pioneers engaging in the field service every month, and that their hours and placements were remarkable. A splendid witness has been given by this valiant group of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are young and old in the pioneer service. The oldest pioneer reporting is a sister, age 87, who entered the pioneer service in 1904. Here is her report as an average throughout the year (and some young pioneers would do well to work as hard): Her monthly averages were 139 hours in the field, 58 back-calls, 29 books, 171 booklets, 2 new subscriptions, and 50 magazines. She has the Lord’s rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another sister only 77 years old has been a pioneer since 1928, and has a monthly average of 168 hours in the field, doing splendid work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In many parts of the earth the Lord’s people find it very difficult to reach those of good-will. Some of these people in various lands find occupation plying the seas in ships. Many of these ships dock in the Port of New York and are reached by a pioneer who devotes all his time to that territory. This regular pioneer brother spending all his time visiting ships encounters many interesting people and has done good work in witnessing for the Kingdom. He has been doing it for years and, because of his consistent activity, has been able to obtain a pass from the government authorities so that he might carry on his Christian activity during this present emergency. In a recent report he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is fine to see how the men are taking hold of the Truth. They are constantly discussing the message in the messrooms and elsewhere, and often carry the books from one ship to another in their suitcases, to the great amazement of the customs officials. This is a great testimony to the work, as they carry around only what they really need and treasure, and don’t like to be bothered with a lot of useless junk. Several times I have left the same book with men who have been torpedoed and didn’t get time to finish the book but want to pick it up where they left off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Many of the Norwegian ships carry English messboys and gun crews, and these are always glad to get the books. The average gunner is a meek and mild individual in private life and wouldn’t hurt a fly. Indications are that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font6"> will go very well on English ships and with those on other ships who can read English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the year just past 530 ships of 40 nations were covered, with 3,009 books and 5,771 booklets and 169 magazines, in 1,517 hours. Thus the Lord has kept the way open in one of the blackest years of the earth’s history as the two Tings’ battle for world domination and the light of freedom grows dimmer by the hour. Surely this is a wonderful testimony to the irresistible power and loving mercy of the great Creator, 'whose name alone is Jehovah/ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is still much territory open for regular pioneers, and immediately after the New World Theocratic Assembly there were hundreds of applications turned in for this service. The ranks are growing daily. The Lord has blessed their efforts, and their service is done in vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>COMPANY ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It had been expected that this year there would be a greater increase in the number of company publishers in the field than has appeared. It had been hoped that we would reach a new peak of 70,000 publishers. The report shows that the brethren in the companies are getting definitely more back-call minded, and assist the people of good-will more consistently than in the past, but, for some reason, in 1942 the companies did not show the increase as was shown in the two previous years. With the visits by the servants to the brethren in the new year, it is hoped that better organization will result and more publishers will become active. There has been an increase in number of companies, due mainly to the work of the special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding campaign of the year was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> Campaign. During this period, 119,588 subscriptions were sent into the office by all publishers, to compare with 99,738 taken during the similar period of 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The company publishers, along with the full-time publishers, are indeed zealous, but the company publisher has not improved in time and effort as did the pioneer. While splendid work is being done by many company publishers in their door-to-door activity, the covering of territory in a more uniform manner, and witnessing with the magazines on street corners and establishing routes, there is room for much improvement on the part of the less active publishers. The majority are doing all they can, but it is noted that some need assistance. It is expected that during the coming year, when the servants to the brethren visit them, these will see their privileges and more efficient organization will be put into effect, thus improving their number of hours and back-calls in Kingdom service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>BACK-CALLS AND BOOK STUDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is clearly seen now that in order to really aid the people of good-will who are seeking meekness and righteousness they must be taught the Scriptures. In order to be properly taught these people must be given the opportunity to study, not just read the publications that are provided them. This they should do in order to be properly helped, but they must study also and search the Scriptures. Therefore the back-call activity has proved to be the most important activity delegated to the Lord’s people at this time. Not only is the back-call essential, and the use of the records containing the various lectures that will assist them in getting a clearer understanding of the purposes of God, but it must be followed up with book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report shows that the publishers in the field have used their phonographs and records excellently and that 10,016,699 persons have heard these short recorded discourses. The outstanding part of the report, however, is the 4,525,982 back-calls that were made by all the publishers in the field. After a few back-calls are made and the minds of the people are cleared up on doctrinal subjects they would like to have discussed, then the thing to do, and that which has been done, is to begin the study of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font6"> Now it will be with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font6"> Mailing of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font6">Study Course has assisted many in arousing them to start reading, but the real good that has been done with the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> in the past year is the study in the homes. It is a joy to see so many company publishers, as well as the pioneers and special pioneer publishers, take hold of this work of making back-calls and conducting book studies with such zeal. The time may come when nothing else can be done than this kind of work. It is good to be in practice now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As far as the United States is concerned 1942 has proved to be without question the greatest year of witnessing for the Kingdom. More hours have been devoted to actual witnessing than ever before. More publishers have taken their stand for the Kingdom. More people have been fed in door-to-door witnessing and in back-call activity. All of this has been done because these ordained ministers of the gospel are determined to fulfill their commission. “But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.”—Jer. 1: 7, 8,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s servants today make the same expression as did Peter and the other apostles, when they say, “We ought to obey God rather than men.”—Acts 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES REPORTING TO BROOKLYN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font6">There are a number of countries and islands of the sea where there are publishers but the groups are too small to organize a branch. Therefore their reports come direct to the Brooklyn office and are tabulated there. It is interesting to note the work accomplished in these various places and the opposition which is brought to bear against them. Even though they are isolated, these brethren stand firm for the Kingdom and continue to proclaim the message. At times, in many places, it has been practically impossible to get any literature to them during the past year. Despite this they use what literature they have on hand and continue to witness by word of mouth as did the apostles in their day. Having in mind that the apostles did not have even a Bible to take from place to place, all the servants of the Lord now are better equipped; for they have the ‘sword of the Spirit’, the Word of God, to use in their visits to the people who have an ear to hear. The combined report of all of these outlying countries shows an excellent increase in the work accomplished. There are now 944 publishers in the field, to compare with 672 a year ago. Their hours have increased, and their back-calls upward of 17,000. Their combined report appears first, and then the reports by countries and islands are given according to the reports received in Brooklyn. Some of the reports are not complete, because of poor communications at this time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom activity in Alaska during the past year dropped somewhat. We had only one pioneer who worked there the year round, and another who worked there during October, November, December and January. The work in Alaska seems to go very well during the fall and winter. In the spring and summer, however, it falls off decidedly, hitting a low about August and picking up again in September and October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are only two companies organized in that vast area, one at Anchorage, with 3, and sometimes 4, publishers reporting, and another at Talkeetna, with 1 publisher, who goes out periodically. There is still much work to be done in Alaska among the 72,000 people who live there, and it may be that some day special pioneer publishers will be sent to some of the territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society has established at Havana, Cuba, a depot from which the work is directed. Cuba is a Spanish-speaking country and large quantities of Spanish literature are distributed every year. During the past twelve months Cuba enjoyed the greatest increase of Kingdom activity ever seen in that country. There are now 25 companies organized. Working in these companies there are more than 550 publishers. Additionally, there are 80 pioneer publishers who are doing splendid work in the isolated territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The depot servant in charge of the Cuban work has been a real assistance to the brethren in that country. The outstanding event of the year was the assembly of the Cuban brethren in the New World Theocratic Assembly at Havana, Cuba. All the lectures that were delivered at the Cleveland convention were translated into Spanish and delivered there simultaneously with the program at Cleveland. This proved to be a rich blessing to the brethren. Extensive advertising was done in the city of Havana and the finest public meeting ever held was arranged for September 20. There were nearly 900 persons attending the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the splendid progress of the work in Cuba it seemed advisable that new depot headquarters be established, and the president authorized the renting of much better quarters, from which point the work will be directed in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren look forward to the coining year with great anticipation of gathering the “other sheep” into the organization. The brethren have proved to be very efficient and capable in looking after the Kingdom interests placed in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A splendid witness is being given by radio stations in Cuba. Daily the message of the Kingdom is broadcast, and much comfort is being brought to the people in that land by this means. The Society is very grateful and expresses appreciation to these stations for their splendid work. They have been broadcasting these programs free for some years. It is noted that in the vicinity of these broadcasting stations a marked increase in the number of publishers is manifest. The continuing heralding of the truth has its effect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We have 3 companies and 7 pioneers in this area: one colored company at Bassetterre, St. Kitts, another colored company at Nevis, and a white company at Nassau, Bahamas. The company at Nassau, composed of 8 publishers, is doing excellent work in all branches of the service. However, for some reason, they seem to be unable to increase in publishers. Bassetterre is composed of 3 colored publishers who devote practically all their time to back-calls and sound work. The brethren at Nevis report only now and then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the 7 pioneers on the island 4 of them were able to work and report consistently. The other 3 were able to get reports through for only the first two months, October and November, 1941. We feel that there is much more work being done on these islands than the reports show. War restrictions affect all of them to a more or less degree and many of the brethren who are working are unable to report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that the religionists have a strangle hold on Nassau and the Bahamas. On September 8,1942, the government notices from the colonial secretary’s office show that the publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society are prohibited by Order No. 1942, which reads, “The importation into the colony of any publication or periodical which propagates the opinions or teachings of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society or of its founder Judge Rutherford is prohibited.” The newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Herald,</span><span class="font5"> dated September 12, published in Nassau, on its editorial page states this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“intolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For the first time in the history of this country, as far as we are aware, a religious publication has been debarred from being imported into the colony. This took place within the week when by an Order in Council the Judge Rutherford publications and the Watch Tower Society publications were prevented from being imported into the Bahamas. This is an order which is for all time: and we would not have readers believe that it is a wartime measure or an emergency measure, because the order has been made under the Bahamas Penal Code and not under the Emergency Powers Act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The editorial goes on to read: “This government has ‘forced the season’! has decided which is error and has banned the error as though it had a God-given right to do so, thus establishing religious intolerance—a thing against which all British people strove long before there was a Germany powerful enough to make war or to make its intolerance felt in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We don’t like this order by the government: and without equivocation we condemn it for whatever our condemnation might be worth in the light of public opinion. It paves the way for dangerous religious intolerance in this colony.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing the encroachments on religious freedom and expression, the editorial goes on to say, “We do not like the trends which government is setting in this colony in connection with free speech and with free religious thought.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here we see another colony of the British Empire opposed to the “four freedoms” for which the United Nations are fighting. That the former king of England, the duke of Windsor, is now in authority in the Bahamas is noted with great interest in connection with the statement in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font5"> page 15, made in 1937, “Sometime in the near future it will doubtless be seen that the recent abdication of Britain’s king was not merely due to the influence of a woman, but due to a greater influence that is symbolized by a woman.” Clearly it appears this is the influence of Rome in the banning of the Society’s publications for all time, permanently, and doubtless further evidence of “greater influence that is symbolized by a woman” will come to light. The “great whore” of Revelation 17, the organization of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is very active at this time in her efforts to gain world domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, those who love truth and righteousness and who have made a covenant to serve the Lord will continue to do so and defeat persecution that is brought to bear against them. The work in the Bahamas, by the Lord’s grace, will continue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is very difficult at this time to get the “meat in due season” to our brethren in Egypt, as we can depend only on the mails, and, in many instances, this does not reach them. But, by the Lord’s grace, all the important information is gotten into their hands during the year through a brother who is traveling on a ship. There were delivered a fair supply of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children, Kingdom News, Hope </span><span class="font5">booklets, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font5"> and these brought to our Egyptian brethren great joy and gladness of heart. They were delighted to learn that their fellow servants throughout the world continue to press on with their activity, and they assured us that they too are pushing on with the proclaiming of the message of the Kingdom and because of their faithfulness and devotion much persecution has been brought to bear against them; but they will defeat persecution by their continued service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The company at Damascus has not been able to report during the year. One active pioneer in this territory died during the past year—Peter Lagakos. Sister Lagakos is still continuing the witness work as much as possible. There is one other pioneer there who reported active service during January, February, March, April and May for himself and some 23 other interested persons. The reports we have been able to get for 1942 show the activity well in excess of the previous year.</span></p>

There is not much being done in the way of back-call work, however, possibly due to limitations of language.

<p><span class="font5">Newfoundland is another country under the supervision of the British Empire that does not place much belief in the “four freedoms”. They have banned the work of Jehovah’s witnesses to the extent that no importations may be made. The brethren there, however, continue to remain faithful and serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Learning that the Lord’s people would be assembled throughout the world on September 20, the brethren at St. John’s made special effort to call together the brethren for the New World Theocratic Assembly and joined us in the world-wide feasting on the truths that the Lord has revealed to them. It was a joy to get this report.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>NEW WORLD THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has always looked well to the care of Uis people. Those who are wholly devoted to Him and faithful in carrying out their covenant relationship with God have always been comforted in every time of need. It was believed by many that the great assembly of 115,000 witnesses of the Lord brought together at St. Louis, Mo., in 1941, might be the last assembly for a little while. That occasion will never be forgotten and will always stand out as one of the important events in the history of the church. The brethren, however, were wondering what would happen next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1942 proved to be one of climax for the Lord’s people and seemed to be a year of unusual testing. The war continued throughout the earth. This gave religionists an excuse to see to it that a ban was placed on the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses almost everywhere; in that country, in this island, and even in cities in our own United States, literature was confiscated, brethren were jailed, mobs were formed, and the property of the Lord’s people destroyed. Everywhere, from one end of the earth to the other, it meant that Jehovah’s witnesses had to stand for their lives. By the Lord’s grace they did 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It appeared to the enemy then, in the early part of 1942, when our beloved Brother Rutherford finished his earthly course and received his reward for many years of faithful service, that here now was the final downfall of the organization known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Here, it appeared to the enemy, was another “break” for their side. Religionists, framing mischief by law, were crowding Jehovah’s witnesses into a corner, and now “their aggressive leader” was removed from the scene of action and surely the organization would disintegrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One newspaper writer said that in 1931, when the Watchtower people took on the new name, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font6"> this new name would not stick. The writer admitted in the article that she was wrong about that, because the name Jehovah’s witnesses did stick. Now that Judge Rutherford is no longer with the earthly organization, the writer said ‘I will not make any more prophecies about the Watch Tower Society of Jehovah’s witnesses. While many have said the organization will go to pieces, I would not venture that statement, but rather wait and see what happens’. This person seemed to follow the advice of Gamaliel, wherein it was stated that ‘if this be not of God, then it will surely come to nought; but if it be of God it would be rather dangerous to be found fighting against it’. This, however, was the exceptional opinion on the part of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite what appeared to the world to be reverses, the plans for the New World Theocratic Assembly began early in March, 1942, and it was not until several months had passed that a suitable place was obtained in which to hold the convention and contracts were signed. The leading of the Lord was manifest in all preliminary arrangements. The Lord wanted His people to be assembled together for some specific purpose. It is interesting in this connection that shortly after the Assembly the United States Government took over the Cleveland Public Auditorium for the duration of the war for training of men, and all contracts for its use were canceled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a year when transportation facilities were pressed to the limit and certain restrictions placed on travel, the Lord’s people were determined to make arrangements to accommodate everyone. Instead of having a central convention, at which place all of Jehovah’s witnesses would come together, it was arranged to have a key city, Cleveland being selected, and to tie in with this city 52 other convention cities throughout the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the convention assembled on September 18, 52 of the 53 cities had completed arrangements and the brethren came together to worship God. It was not just as easy as that, for there were many contracts broken and court battles fought and much work to change arrangements; but, nevertheless, the Lord permitted His people to have this thrilling assembly. It was only in one small place that arrangements could not be completed, and these brethren went to the nearest convention. The details of arranging the conventions in all of these 52 places showed hard work and a faithful effort put forth on the part of all the brethren in the companies having to do with the arrangements. With Jehovah’s blessing it was finally successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All branches throughout the earth were told of the Assembly and asked if they could join in, even though direct-wire communications eould not be set up, due to the war conditions. Such were arranged in Great Britain, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Trinidad, South and West Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Hawaii, Newfoundland, and, by the Lord’s grace, it was possible in many places for the messages that the Lord would have delivered at the main convention at Cleveland to be delivered there. It was truly a world-wide convention under the direction of the great Theocrat and Christ Jesus the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not knowing of the things that were going to be brought to their attention at the convention, the very actions of the brethren world-wide were those of determination to fight for their right of worship and the honor that the Lord had given them, namely, of being His witnesses in the earth at this time. The Lord’s organization was on the offensive, and not for one moment did they slack their hand against all opposition. Amidst the most distressing time in the history of the church, and at the time when the “other sheep” were being assembled unto Mount Zion, these faithful servants of the Lord moved forward and assembled at the New World Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the morning of September 18 the brethren came together in the various auditoriums throughout the land to receive instructions on field service, to get their territories, and to begin advertising the public meeting, “Peace—Can It Last ?” as well as to comfort those who mourn throughout the various convention cities. A splendid organization was set up everywhere for rooming accommodations, assigning of territory for field work, bookrooms, cafeterias, volunteer registration booths, the registration of pioneers, the parking of automobiles, and everything was in good order and the needs of the brethren were looked after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After doing their day’s work in the interests of The Theocracy they assembled at their convention halls for the opening session of the convention. As one looked over the audience he could see that there was the feeling of expectancy. Something was going to happen. But what was it? What would the Lord, through His Theocratic organization, bring to their attention? It was a tense moment because of their keen interest in the Lord’s work, but they did not lack faith and it could not be said that they were overanxious about anything. Everyone knew for a certainty there would be more work to be done. But how would this be revealed in the Scriptures? With the troubled world all about them and the greatest period of persecution still in full swing, what should be done? Before the hour had ended there was no question in the minds of those attending the convention that a definite decision had been reached and the policy that had been pursued for months in the defeat of persecution was going to be carried on with even greater determination and vigor than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the opening words of the chairman everyone recognized that this was not going to be a convention in memorial of a fellow worker. One point was established definitely in their minds: this is not a man-made organization; it is God’s, and is going to continue to operate as such. The address of welcome was brief, but very much to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then came the keynote speech, “The Only Light.” This talk in its entirety was published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> There is no question in anyone’s mind as to the points made. Summing it up in two words it meant, “Go ahead.” By the time the speaker had finished ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">plaining the prophecies of Isaiah 59 and 60 the brethren were sitting on the edge of their seats, so to speak. Shall we slack up a little bit and hide ourselves for a little season? No! Shall we put on the “soft pedal”? No! Shall we relax ? No! Go ahead! was the answer. Jehovah’s witnesses received what they were looking for: additional proof that the course they had taken was the right one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the last fifteen minutes of this hour it was the privilege of the president of the Society to present the ‘sword of the Spirit’. This instrument was accepted with joy and gladness and the expressions on the faces of all the audience were those of complete satisfaction and thanksgiving. Grateful to the Lord for this gift of the new Watchtower Bible, the brethren now were more determined than ever to “go ahead” until the very end and nothing could stop them in their singing of the praises of the Most High. Many were the remarks after this hour, “If this is the beginning of the New World Theocratic Assembly, what will the end be ?” They seemed so full of the joy of the Lord then that they could not contain any more. This Bible was something that every one of the brethren desired and wanted, and here, at last, it had been provided for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family that had been working hard for months on this new Bible had an inward feeling of great satisfaction because they had been used of the Lord to prepare this greatest of all instruments placed in our hands. While long days were spent in the preparation of the Bible and many became tired because of the strenuous and arduous work which all of them did gladly, there came to them at this occasion a feeling of gratitude to their heavenly Father for the great privilege they have of being at Bethel and serving their brethren. Receiving their own personal copy at the New World Theocratic Assembly along with all the other brethren made them cherish it as a treasure worthy to be kept always, a treasure that will never wear out, but the more one uses it the brighter it becomes and the richer is its value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Saturday morning arrived, and who could hold them back from service work ? The schedule of the morning was witnessing from door to door; information walkers had their positions to take, those distributing handbills had their work to do, sound-cars were in operation, and everyone who was not assigned to some definite task at the cafeteria, bookroom, rooming assignments, or the numerous duties that have to be taken care of in and about a convention, was out in the field. It appeared that every person at the convention had something to do. Those reporting going from door to door and doing the publicity work in the streets totaled upward of 49,000 at all the conventions. This remarkable figure shows practically everyone attending the 52 conventions in the United States was either in the field service or doing something on convention arrangements. This was the New World Theocratic Assembly in which everybody worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Coming back from the field, joyful in their experiences of again having the privilege of representing the Lord in territory in which most of them had never worked, being in the convention cities, they assembled in the various auditoriums which were soon to be tied together by direct-wire communication with Cleveland, Ohio. The Lord’s people were eagerly awaiting the lecture “Fighters for the New World”. By this time, throughout all the 52 convention cities 80,000 had assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This lecture had two climaxes: the victory of Jeph-thah over his enemies the first climax, and, the second, the offering up of his daughter for full-time temple service as a sacrifice to Jehovah. The brethren were thrilled at the description of the battle carried on under the leadership of the Greater Jephthah. They saw clearly that the Greater Jephthah is using Jehovah’s organization, the Society, and that the Theocratic rule is the only rule that the Lord would have His people follow; that the Lord’s people will fight for their rights to worship God and will do everything to maintain their present position and will not allow the encroachments of totalitarian powers, or the modern Ammonites, to come in against them. There could be no slacking of the hand from now on in anyone’s mind. God had given to Jehovah’s witnesses the right to worship Him according to His Word. This they would not fail to do. Anyone interfering with these rights would be pushed back into his own borders. Definitely it was established that this gospel of the Kingdom </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">shall be preached.</span><span class="font6"> The “Go ahead” signal had been sounded and, by the Lord’s grace and with His help, all the servants of the Most High would go ahead until final victory, which they are assured of gaining. This made glad the hearts of all and brought great joy to the faithful followers of the great Theocrat and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second climax of the talk, explaining the offering up of Jephthah’s daughter, was so real and touching that to many it brought tears. They fully appreciated that the drama of Jephthah shows that all the fruitages that may result because of our witness and service for the Kingdom must be offered up unto the Lord, even as Jephthah offered up to the Lord his only daughter. All the increase that God gives this work of gathering his “other sheep” into the fold, this great throng acknowledged to be the Lord’s and they will yield it up unto the Lord to be used wholly in His service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of this discourse a resolution of action was offered, and accepted unanimously with a great shout “AyeI” Then, simultaneously in the 52 convention cities, there was presented to the fighters for the New World the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font6"> This was unexpected. It was almost too much. They had been satisfied with the truths revealed, and now to have presented to them a new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font6"> it shows the unbounding loving-kindness of Jehovah to his people in giving them further comfort and assurances at this time of the forward march of his people. Twenty-four hours had not passed since the opening of the convention, but in this short period of time everyone felt that no matter what the cost to come to this assembly, it was worth it. This was the Lord’s doing, and marvelous in our eyes. This was the assembly of his people, and for a purpose. The New World has its earthly representatives, Jehovah’s witnesses, and, by the Lord’s grace, they will never forsake their ambassadorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satisfied, joyful, and ready for anything, they assembled for the evening meetings, there to hear the first discourse, on “Pioneer Opportunities Now”. The call went forth for 10,000 pioneers in the United States by next April; and, from the way the brethren have applied for pioneer service since this convention, it appears very likely that we shall have the 10,000 in the United States. Within four weeks after the convention ended 600 new applications for pioneer service had been received at the office. These fighters for the New World were ready to give everything in the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then followed a discourse on “Serving The Theocracy”—another surprise, bringing to the Assembly the new organization instructions showing that the Theocratic rule is the proper and the only rule among the Lord’s organization. These new organization instructions were received with gladness of heart, and everyone seemed to have the expression or felt, ‘This is what we need; this is what we wanted.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the conclusion of this lecture on “Serving The Theocracy” another talk was delivered, on the subject “Victory”. It was pointed out here that the fighters for the New World had gained many victories during the past year in the courts of the land. The speaker showed, too, that there were still many fights ahead, but, by the Lord’s grace, no ground would be given. Toward the end of this talk it was the speaker’s privilege to introduce to the convention assembly and release </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font6"> No. 11. Hundreds of thousands of these were distributed that evening and the next day by all the conventioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunday morning, September 20, arrangements were made for the immersion of those who had consecrated their lives to serve the Lord. The combined report shows that 3,548 symbolized their consecration by water baptism on this Sunday morning. Add to this the report from other countries, and in one day nearly 5,000 expressed themselves before witnesses that, henceforth, they would serve God rather than man. Surely the “other sheep” are coming out of the Devil’s organization into the New World, and associating themselves with the Lord and his Theocratic Government. These new fighters for the New World were given the privilege of engaging in the field service Sunday morning and inviting the people who were looking for truth and righteousness to come to the convention auditorium that afternoon to hear the lecture “Peace—Can It Last?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 4: 00 p.m. Sunday, September 20, the time arrived for the delivery of the lecture so widely advertised, and the report shows that at the 52 convention cities in the United States, tied together by direct wire, there were 129,699 that had come to hear the lecture. The question “Peace—Can It Last ?” was satisfactorily answered from the Scriptures. All in attendance were truly amazed at the fulfilling of Bible prophecy, and the understanding of Revelation 17th chapter brought real satisfaction and an insight into the future events which show clearly that Jehovah’s witnesses still have something to do until “Peace and Safety” is cried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ‘beast that was, and is not, and shall again be present’ opened the eyes of many concerning the Babylonish religious “harlot” that will ride this “beast” very shortly. It was pointed out how the harlot would ride this beast with seven heads and ten horns for only “one hour”, but during that “hour” Jehovah’s witnesses can expect no mercy, for it will be the last great effort put forth by this Vatican-ruled religious organization to get complete control and bring about world domination, with her in the saddle and Jehovah’s witnesses trodden under foot. The Scriptures, however, point out that the Catholic Hierarchy, along with its great world power of totalitarian rule, will not last, but will go down at the battle of Armageddon, but the lovers of righteousness will prevail under Jehovah’s protection and then peace will truly be established through Christ Jesus toward all Armageddon survivors of good-will toward his righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lecture held out hope to those who were looking for something stable and real. Those persons whose faith in the Bible might have been a little ‘shaky’ were aided by the lecture to renew their faith and strengthen their belief of God’s Word. In these days of world distress so little is said about the Bible by religionists that the people very seldom look tn it as their guide. Jehovah’s witnesses use it as the only “sword of the Spirit”, which it is, not only to comfort people but to strengthen them in the way that leads to life. Everyone attending the meeting was offered a free copy of the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font6"> which was released, for the first time, after the lecture. The offer was made, also, that anyone desiring ten copies to distribute to his friends could take them without any cost to himself. Over 500,000 booklets were taken away by those attending the convention, for themselves and for distributing to other persons. The regular edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font6"> also, was released, and thousands of copies of these were taken by the public attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those attending all sessions of the New World Theocratic Assembly did not hurry home after the public meeting, but awaited the final meeting of the convention, because every session had been so filled with “meat in due season”, and brought such strength and joy of heart to those assembled, that they didn’t want to miss anything. The Sunday evening session proved to be very beneficial, reports being made at the Cleveland assembly by several brethren from foreign lands, and by the convention servant. The information brought to light was most interesting. The convention then concluded with a brief address by the president of the Society. He said:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty years ago this month, in 1922, the Lord’s people assembled at Cedar Point, Ohio. There the clear call was sounded, “Advertise the King and Kingdom.” That year’s report reveals there were 2,250 company publishers in the field each week, associated with 980 companies. There were also 269 full-time pioneer publishers. Those faithful publishers, and there are many of them who are with us here today, kept their covenant, maintained their integrity, fought a good fight, endured hardness as seasoned soldiers, and, by the Lord’s grace, they are still preaching this gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soon after 1922 their labors brought forth fruit, the Ruth and Esther class. The only Light, which never fails, showed clearly to all in those years their responsibilities and privileges and they continued to work. Jehovah in his loving-kindness has blessed the efforts of these brethren and brought forth the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, twenty years later, we find 57,000 company publishers actively engaged in the field service in this country alone, associated with 3,140 companies, and 5,600 full-time workers. You fighters for the New World do not engage in this activity for any selfish gain. You are interested only in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and His kingdom. You see clearly that there are many persons of good-will scattered throughout the earth, including your territory, and every effort must be put forth to reach them. Many of them have recently been reached and now are associated with Jehovah’s witnesses and have attended this New World Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil hates the growth of Jehovah’s organization. He hates everything that is of Jehovah. He is out to destroy it if at all possible. But he can’t. Jehovah God has given us a certain possession, and that possession is the “glorious land” with the freedom to preach his Word and to worship him. That freedom the Lord’s people will fight for to the very last ditch. Putting our trust wholly in him, no matter where we live our worship of the Most High can never be taken away from us. Jehovah will bring the victory. Our fight in this “strange work” is not yet over. We may expect much more persecution and conditions more trying. Everyone must prove his singleness of purpose and do this one thing: preach the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither the sisters nor the brothers will be spared. Each must decide the issue stated by the apostle Paul: “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, . . . Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.” (1 Cor. 6: 20; 7: 23) This means that no dictatorial, totalitarian government has the right to boss Jehovah’s people around, and to take them out of God’s service as ministers of the gospel and force them to become the regimented servants of men. On this issue there can be no compromise. Our faithful brethren on the European continent and elsewhere have refused to compromise, and hence are suffering forcible restraints because ‘not putting forth their hands unto iniquity’. Anticipating this state of affairs, you should now redeem the time and get to the “other sheep” with the equipment the Lord has provided for you. Conditions are heading for a climax. The ‘beast with the seven heads and ten horns’ ‘that was, and is not, and shall again be present’ will soon make itself manifest. The “whore” will be riding the “beast”. Then comes the greatest tribulation of all time; but between now and then we have something to do. The Lord has furnished us ample equipment. Our chief weapon is “the sword of the Spirit”, and this, by the Lord’s grace, we will wield with greater efficiency. How long we can keep this up we do not know. We do know, however, that our covenant with the Lord compels us to keep our part of the agreement, and that is, to carry on until death or until the Lord says it is enough. The Devil said it was enough long ago; but we are not listening to the Devil, nor his agents, nor his persecutors. We hearken unto the command of the Greater Jeph-thah and will follow the Lord’s organization. We have vowed to fight for the New World until the Lord brings the victory, and we will bring all the fruitage of victory unto Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The warfare ahead of the Christian will not be an easy one. In these great trials in which all of you will soon enter, because of your faithfulness and devotion, the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font5"> will be a special comfort. A careful study of Job along with the new question booklet that will soon be released will be an unfailing help and bring to you strength so that you may maintain your integrity to the end, come what may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To further comfort and aid our brethren, the Society next month sends forth servants to the brethren. These will visit you. They will aid you in your organization. They will show you your blessed privileges and responsibilities. Soon the growth of all companies should be manifest. Not only that, but the companies should multiply in all parts of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experiences of the early church seem to indicate that somehow or other Jehovah will kefep His headquarters organization intact and always functioning. We can feel confident that He will continue to get instructions to His people without fail and in His own marvelous way down till the work is finished and the sign of the final end appears. At that time we may expect the ‘tidings out of the east and out of the north’. Along with these tidings Jehovah’s people will give a great shout as did the people who marched round Jericho on the seventh day the seventh time around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah in his kindness and loving mercy has brought his people together in the greatest assembly of all time. This assembly in itself proves the unity of action on the part of Jehovah’s servants in the earth and, as the psalmist says, in the 122d Psalm, we can say: “Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.” Henceforth the fighters for the New World will stand shoulder to shoulder, all subject to Theocratic organization instructions, and will continue to proclaim the message of the Lord right down to the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the heat of battle the faithful men of old, the princes, will undoubtedly make their appearance. These valiant fighters will then feel right at home, because they have been in many battles on the side of the Lord and have seen the enemy defeated, and will join in the song of victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We look forward with joy to the work ahead, not fearful of what may come, but knowing that triumph is near and that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated for ever. As we go forward now, the most favored creatures in all the earth, fully equipped with instruments of service, we can say with the apostle Paul: “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveablc, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15: 57, 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The closing day of this New World Theocratic Assembly was by far the most hazardous day of the nation-wide convention. Demonized, religionist-inspired mobs formed in many parts of the United States and vented their religious fury upon the faithful witnesses of Jehovah who desired to meet together in peaceful worship of Almighty God. Little Rock, Ark., Springfield, Ill., and Klamath Falls, Oreg., were the cities gaining nation-wide publicity and the reputation of being truly un-American, where mobs run free and little or nothing is done to protect the rights of citizens. Brethren were beaten, imprisoned, shot, had their clothing torn from their bodies, and their literature was burned and destroyed, automobiles were wrecked and overturned, property was destroyed, and the completely insane mobsters were permitted to go free by the so-called “law-enforcement officers”, even when evidence was presented to show clearly the guilt of many of these vicious assailants. Even Bibles were confiscated by the mobs and publicly burned. Only the Devil could inspire creatures to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the face of all this violence, putting their trust wholly in Jehovah, the brethren stood their ground and a faithful witness was given to those who viewed the mob action. The brethren carried into operation the tactics of Nehemiah and his faithful brethren in Jehovah’s service and they fought for the interests of the Kingdom and for their brethren. By Jehovah’s grace, the brethren were able to assemble in every city where the convention was to be held and they received the precious truths Jehovah had for them from the 17th chapter of Revelation, announced publicly in “Peace— Can It Last?” It is no wonder that the Devil tried to prevent the people from receiving such a message; but he cannot prevent the message of the Almighty God from going to those to whom it is His will it shall go. These futile attempts to discourage Jehovah’s witnesses and companions through assaults and harassment have only served to bring the Lord’s people into closer unity and opened the eyes of many of good-will to the wickedness of religionists and their political minions. Jehovah caused everything to result to His praise, and The Theocracy was magnified by the New World Theocratic Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By reason of this most blessed assembly the fighters for the New World were ready, well equipped and anxious to return home to carry on in their work as Jehovah’s witnesses. They would not slack the hand. All know why the Lord assembled his people. They had an assignment, and with joy of heart they were going to do it. Maintaining their integrity, knowing that they will be “more than conquerors through him that loved us”, they now go forward to finish the work that they had undertaken, to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">“Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake” (Luke 6:22); and so it has been. Those who have faithfully followed the Lord Jesus, and committed no wrong, gladly admit they are the true Christians who obey Jehovah. They are not criminals and do not go about deliberately violating laws of the land. The opposition is brought against them by religionists in an effort to stop their work of bearing witness to the Kingdom, and the wicked adopt the same tactics as the religionists of Daniel’s day. “Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God [Jehovah].” (Dan. 6 : 5) For faithfulness in their worship of the Almighty God, Jehovah’s witnesses are hated, and the religionists want no company with them. Therefore, if it were possible they would put them off the earth. They are a “nation not desired” and it appears that no nation on the face of the earth is glad to have Jehovah’s witnesses in their country. At least it appears that way in the United States. Jehovah’s witnesses have been mobbed, arrested, thrown into jail, given unjust trials; their homes have been ransacked and burned; they have been shot, beaten with clubs, mistreated by sheriffs, police, and administrative officers. Their children have been deprived of the right of education; laws have been framed to “get” Jehovah’s witnesses ; heavy taxes have been levied so as to make it impossible for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on in certain cities and communities; children have been separated from parents; and many other atrocities have been committed against them. Why? Because they preach this gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This opposition on the part of men who serve this wicked organization that dominates the world does not for one minute frighten the servants of the Most High from carrying on their work. Some of these wrongs committed against Jehovah’s witnesses can be taken to the courts of the land and there some justice provided. Many courts, however, have the same hatred of Jehovah’s witnesses as do the people that bring persecution upon them, as case after case goes to a higher court until it can have a just hearing. A brief resume of the legal work necessary to be cared for by the Society is herewith set out. This applies only to the United States; similar action is carried on throughout the whole world. “By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.” —Ps. 41:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year last past has been one of increased opposition on the part of the enemy. Enraged over their failure to stop Jehovah’s faithful servants by means of the Catholic conspiracy of mobocracy against publishers of the Kingdom message, the Hierarchy and allied dupes resorted to their old trick of ‘framing mischief by law’ with increased brutishness. “Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?” (Ps. 94: 20) Organized mob violence decreased, but arrests and prosecutions have increased over last year’s high record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Resisting, Jehovah’s servants have fought all this increased opposition to the last “ditch” and through every court available. 'Putting on more steam’ by the Lord’s people has correspondingly stirred up the enemy in every part of the land. “But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.” (Mark 13:9) In spite of occasional and apparent defeats in these fights, trusting in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6"> Leader to direct the way and give the results, we have pushed ahead.—Isa. 55: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effort has been blessed with many victories. “The horse is prepared against the day of battle; but safety is of [Jehovah].” (Prov. 21:31) Time and space allowed here prevent report on all the victories, but we mention a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In November, 1941, in the mob-violencc-infested city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, the United States District Court granted a permanent injunction restraining enforcement of a local ordinance under which scores of brethren had been persecuted and falsely charged because they faithfully distributed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> on the streets. That ordinance prohibited distribution of literature which held any religion up to 'contumacious reproach and ridicule’. Within a few days thereafter the United States District Court at Fort Worth, Texas, granted a permanent injunction against that state’s cities of Ranger, Dublin, Comanche, and Coleman, enjoining enforcement of several kinds of ordinances mischievously framed and misapplied against preaching of the gospel of The Theocracy by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also in November, 1941, the Vermont Supreme Court, in the ease of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">State</span><span class="font6"> v. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Greaves,</span><span class="font6"> 112 Vt. 222, held a Rutland peddler’s license-tax ordinance unconstitutional and void because wrongly applied to activity of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On December 8,1941, the day after the sneak attack at Pearl Harbor, the Indiana Supreme Court declared that 'advocating the establishment of God’s Kingdom and declaring that all governments of the present evil world would be soon destroyed at Armageddon’ did not constitute a violation of the state sedition laws, and that Jehovah’s witnesses had been falsely charged under such statutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In March, 1942, the Illinois Supreme Court set aside the conviction of several of Jehovah’s witnesses under a statute of that state prohibiting a breach of the peace by distributing literature that held up one’s religion to ‘lack of virtue and contempt’. At the same time, the same court, in another case, declared that a peddler’s license-tax ordinance of Blue Island, Illinois, was unconstitutional when applied to Jehovah’s witnesses, and that their conviction thereunder could not stand. Thereafter, on two occasions, counsel for the City of Blue Island tried in vain to have that court reverse its decision favoring Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In April, 1942, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed and set aside convictions of two of Jehovah’s witnesses for an alleged violation of a peddler’s license-tax ordinance of the City of Fredericksburg. That high court also held the ordinance unconstitutional and declared that the state officials were guilty of discrimination in prosecuting Jehovah’s witnesses thereunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In May, 1942, the Supreme Court of Louisiana declared that the “Green River” ordinance of Shreveport, prohibiting entry by peddlers upon private premises without prior invitation, could not be applied to Jehovah’s witnesses. They, as the court found, are not peddlers, but ministers preaching the gospel, and if their conviction were sustained it would mean that every clergyman, whether pastor, priest or rabbi, who visited his flock without prior invitation would be guilty of a crime. That the court declared it would not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During June, 1942, the New Hampshire Supreme Court set aside the conviction of a brother charged with violating the child labor laws in permitting a young boy to engage in street magazine work with him, using </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> That court held that the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses was not a commercial business of selling, but that of worshiping Almighty God according to dictates of conscience and preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">July (1942) also includes a number of outstanding victories. The Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of a brother under an ordinance of the city of Guymon restricting distribution of literature without a license. That same court, in January and December preceding, granted writs of habeas corpus in two cases and set aside the convictions of Jehovah’s witnesses under city ordinances prohibiting distribution of literature in restricted business areas of certain Oklahoma towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On August 28, 1942, the Supreme Court of Missouri granted a writ of habeas corpus and released two brethren, man and wife, held in jail at Caruthersville, Missouri, for 78 days, under very unhealthful surroundings, and who had been falsely arrested and convicted under a peddler’s license-tax ordinance of that city. The court found that these two faithful servants of the Lord had been wrongly denied and refused their right of appeal as a result of mob violence when serious physical injury was inflicted upon friends of those brethren who tried to file an appeal bond in their behalf and to perfect an appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In September, 1942, an action was brought on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses and their children in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, against the State Board of Education. An extraordinary victory was given at the hand of Jehovah, which is mentioned here for its value to parents and children in other states, even though the very prompt decision of the specially constituted three-judge federal court issued a few days after the end of the service year 1942. On October 6, 1942, that high court, speaking through presiding Circuit Judge Parker, declared that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font6"> flag case decided in June, 1940, by the United States Supreme Court was very poor evidence of the law, in view of the fact that four of the seven judges now of the Supreme Court that delivered the 1940 decision today publicly declare that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font6"> case was “wrongly decided”. That federal district court in West Virginia openly refused to follow the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font6"> decision and enjoined the state board of education and all schools within the state of West Virginia from enforcing the regulation requiring a flag salute by Jehovah’s witnesses in that state. There all the children have been returned to school and are not required to participate in the flag salute. It seems that this timely decision can be taken as an indication that the Lord may cause the United States Supreme Court to reverse itself on the flag-salute question and thus make that victory nation-wide. We shall wait on the Lord for the results. In the meantime, however, it is also noteworthy that in July, 1942, the Kansas Supreme Court also boldly refused to follow the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis </span><span class="font6">decision of the United States Supreme Court, and held that ‘there is and can be no statute or regulation valid under the Kansas Constitution which would authorize or justify expelling children of Jehovah’s witnesses from school solely because those children refuse to salute a flag by reason of their belief formed from a study of the Bible, which belief is not of a kind that prevents them from being good, industrious, homeloving, law-abiding citizens’. Similarly, in June, 1942, said the New Jersey Supreme Court, “Liberty of conscience is not subject to uncontrolled administrative action.” And, in so holding, that court set aside the conviction of parents whose children had been excluded from school when they refused to salute the flag because contrary to their conscientious scruples to do so under their training as obedient servants of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time, throughout the entire country, many parents face prosecution and conviction under laws prohibiting the contributing to delinquency and dependency of children by teaching their children Godgiven truths and the Creator’s laws that prohibit saluting any flag by persons bound in a covenant with Almighty God. Many such cases are in the high courts of numerous states, and scores more will follow with the growing opposition from the demons, unless some way of deliverance for such brethren is provided in His due time by Jehovah for His own honor’s sake. Let all remember Luke 18:7,8, and consider also Psalm 18: 50. Significantly, in this connection, in June 1942, in West Virginia, too, the federal government’s case against public officials who, in June 1940, shared in forcing some of Jehovah’s witnesses to swallow large quantities of castor oil and otherwise tortured those humble servants of the Lord resulted in conviction of those officials in federal district court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out of thousands of charges brought against Jehovah’s witnesses in lower courts throughout the country only a few cases ultimately reach the Supreme Court or appellate courts of various states, because the brethren, diligently following Jehovah’s provided counsel set forth in the booklets </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended,</span><span class="font6"> either win in the intermediate courts where their original convictions are set aside or successfully defend their cases in the trial courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the above many legal battles in defending our right to preach the gospel, many of the brethren have handled their own cases in courts, proving that they were ministers of the gospel. Due to their individual decision to be faithful to their commission from God as He has revealed it to them in his Word and determining to keep their covenants with him, hundreds of young men have been detained in federal prisons. These individuals are being supplied with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font6"> and other literature published by the Society, on their request. In some of the prisons the brethren are allowed to study the Word of the Lord together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here a general listing of various types of cases now (October 1, 1942) in the Supreme Court or appellate courts of various states will prove interesting to many. Cases involving the flag-salute issue are before the Indiana Appellate Court and the Supreme Court of each of the following states: Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota, Washington; and also several such cases are pending in the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals, which court will also hear a number of other cases involving Jehovah’s witnesses convicted under ‘breach of peace’ ordinances. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis, Missouri, has for consideration and decision two cases involving license-tax ordinance of Arkansas and a permit-ordinance injunction case against West Plains, Missouri. License-tax cases are before the Supreme Court of each of the following states: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin. The Kentucky Court of Appeals and the New York Court of Appeals each has for consideration a license-tax ordinance case; and the Supreme Court of South Dakota has a sales-tax case. Before the New Hampshire Supreme Court is a case involving an ordinance requiring “sellers” of literature to wear a badge. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has before it a case against one of Jehovah’s witnesses charged with violating the child labor laws in permitting her niece to work with her from house to house in carrying the Kingdom message to the people. And a license case is before the Georgia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to handling almost all of these appeals to the high courts just mentioned, the legal desk, through correspondence and by telephone and personal interviews at Brooklyn, constantly advises the brethren as to how effectively to resist the enemies’ attempts to hinder and stop the witness work. A daily average of forty letters come to the legal desk. During the past twelve months it was necessary to advise and direct the brethren in the defense of approximately two thousand cases growing out of the arrest of more than three thousand publishers in the United States alone. Additionally, attention has been given to any and all cases in the lower courts in New York city and near-by communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much trouble was also caused by the enemy in opposing the carrying into effect of the request left by Brother Rutherford that his body be buried in California. Handled also by the legal desk, that fight was finally given up and our case against the enemy left with Jehovah God, whose righteous Executioner shall ultimately enforce His judgment of vengeance against the opposing enemy in that controversy. Such opposers have lost, and there will be no appeal from the judgment of that High Court and no escape from the execution of that righteous judgment of death for every willful opposer, to be administered by the mighty Warrior, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the state of Mississippi, in March, 1942, the legislature, under control of un-American Legionnaires and the Roman Hierarchy, forced through and passed a law entitled House Bill 689, called an “anti-sedition” act, which makes it unlawful for anyone to possess or circulate literature that explains why a faithful follower of Jesus Christ cannot salute the flag of any country. Immediately after passage of this law there were wholesale arrests of the brethren throughout the entire state. Public officials have administered this law in a Nazi-gestapo fashion by invading many homes and meetings, confiscating much literature and sound equipment and otherwise abusing many harmless persons because they choose to worship Jehovah God. The first case under this new statute was tried in Tupelo, in May. Since then many other indictments under the law have been tried. At the end of the service year there were pending in the Mississippi Supreme Court cases against eight of Jehovah’s witnesses arrested under this law. The cases against two of these were argued in September, and, if lost, will be taken, for test, to the United States Supreme Court. In July, 1942, the state of Louisiana passed a similar law, but so far only a few of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested under it. Louisiana officials probably are awaiting the outcome of our skirmishes in Mississippi. In considering these two laws, we find much comfort in the record of Paul’s experience with false accusers who said concerning him: “We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” And in the words of defense Paul boldly uttered in court: “They neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets.”—Acts 24: 5,12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States Supreme Court on June 8, 1942, attempted to rule off the face of the nation the apostolic way of preaching the gospel, by a 5-to-4 decision approving license-tax ordinances enacted to apply only to commercial peddlers of merchandise but wrongly ‘framed’ and misconstrued by officials who hate liberty as exercised by Jehovah’s witnesses in their preaching the gospel and receiving willing offerings of money to further such work. (Ps. 94: 20) That court failed to consider Psalm 2:10-12 and Psalm 9:17. Its ruling was made in three cases, one each, respectively, from Alabama, Arkansas, and Arizona. Strong, righteous dissenting opinions were filed by Chief Justice Stone and Justice Murphy, concurred in by Justices Black and Douglas. Within the time allowed by order of court, a motion for rehearing was prepared and filed. This motion has not yet been decided upon by the Supreme Court. If granted, the cases will be reargued. Since the rendering of the decision on June 8, 1942, and the filing of the motion for rehearing we have docketed with the United States Supreme Court four more license-tax cases: two from Pennsylvania, one from Texas, and one from the District of Columbia. Majority members of the high court probably thought that the decision of June 8, 1942, would mean the end of Jehovah’s witnesses as far as they were concerned. Doubtless they are surprised to find that they now have the total number of seven cases to dispose of involving the same question. Our motion for rehearing in the three cases mentioned is supported by briefs filed by American Newspaper Publishers Association, American Civil Liberties Union, and a former attorney general of the United States, Homer Cummings, in behalf of the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, who have exclaimed to the court that their activity is seriously affected by the decision of June 8, 1942,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also in the high court we have two other cases from Texas involving validity of ordinances which the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals side-stepped passing on last spring. In the nation’s highest court is also a case from Oregon involving a conviction under the child labor laws, and a case from Arizona involving the conviction of a parent whose child was expelled from school for refusing to salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While not unmindful of the Goliath-like proportions of the Devil’s organization and of the craftiness and hatred of his agents that oppose Jehovah’s servants in all these fights which it would be impossible to win in the strength or wisdom of man, we nevertheless trust confidently in the Most High and his King, and in his strength go boldly and fearlessly on under the guidance of his all-powerful hand, as Christ Jesus our Leader and Deliverer maneuvers the battle while his willing followers march out against the opposing hosts. “0 sing unto [Jehovah] a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.” (Psalm 98:1) By Jehovah’s grace, we expect and are determined to push on in the fight against demonism in the courts of the land until Jehovah (not his enemy, the Devil) directs us to stop. Under His guidance and protecting care we confidently believe that He can and will give victory as it pleases Him and in His own good time and way; and that until Christ Jesus, the Wonderful Counselor of all Jehovah’s servants, gives final and complete victory we must “turn the battle to the gate” in His strength. (Isa. 28:5,6) With the irresistible Greater Jephthah we look forward to the complete pushing out of the modern Ammonites before He executes Jehovah’s judgment of death upon them at Armageddon, now very near. May Jehovah God continue to strengthen his servants in every place, giving them greater faith and courage to serve and fight for the King’s brethren, our fellow warriors for the New World (Neh. 4:14), which fighters now boldly push the battle in the front lines, house-to-house and street witnessing, against the enemy and for a standard or sign of living hope for all persons of good-will to find the way of escape to Jehovah’s eternal Kingdom.—Ezek. 3:18-20; 33:8, 9.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>“THE WATCHTOWER”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The psalmist tells us, “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (Ps. 97: 11) Jehovah in his loving-kindness and goodness has continued to bring the light to those who love righteousness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has kept the only light prominently before the servants of the Lord. This light has helped not only those who have entered a covenant with the Lord, but also those who are seeking meekness and righteousness. It is sown for such, and has been a great help to them. The Lord has revealed many things to his people during the last year and has made clear the Scriptures, which have been written for our admonition and learning upon whom the end of the world has come. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has pointed out clearly our place in the New World and the work that must still be done in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers of the. New World and those fighting in its interests, seeing the importance of this journal and the need of placing it in as many homes as possible, have during the past year put forth every effort to increase its circulation and to distribute it in the streets and from door to door. The subscription list of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font6"> W</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower</span><span class="font6"> is the greatest it has ever been. At the Brooklyn office it is published in the English language as well as seven other languages, namely, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian. Its total circulation for the year aggregates 9,962,527 copies. This is an increase in circulation of over 1,800,000 copies over the previous year. It is a joy to see the constant increase in the circulation of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine. It is the most important publication printed today and has brought more comfort to those who love righteousness than any other one publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the war lines of communications have been slowed down and in many instances there is no longer space to carry mail of the second class. It has been necessary in many foreign countries for the brethren to print their own edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> and this is now being done, using the material appearing in the one or two copies of the American edition they receive by air mail. The world-wide circulation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is far greater than revealed in the above figures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>“CONSOLATION”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This magazine has had a healthy growth during the year and is enjoyed by many. It is published in four languages at the Brooklyn office: in English, Greek, Spanish, and Ukrainian. The biweekly circulation has increased considerably over the previous year. It was necessary to print over 1,000,000 copies more throughout the year than in 1941. The total number of copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> printed during 1942 was 6,846,502.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Glancing quickly at the accomplishments of the Lord’s people during the year, by His grace, it is marvelous in our eyes. Outstanding in the year was the New World Theocratic Assembly and its releases of “food convenient”, and it brought to a conclusion and a climax the work accomplished during 1942. The opposition to the work has been greater than in any other year, but the expansion of the work has gone ahead with leaps and bounds. More publishers are in the field. The greatest number of pioneers ever proclaiming the message of the Kingdom is now in full-time service. Millions of homes have been visited; a greater number of hours have been devoted to the work. Jehovah has declared that “they shall know that I am Jehovah”, and, by the grace of God and with His continued help and his comforting messages brought to us through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> the brethren in America are well equipped as fighters for the New World to carry on “until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man”.—Isa. 6 :11.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Society has a Branch office. From this point it directs the activity of the Lord’s people in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. There has been a marked increase in the work throughout this vast territory. The workers are zealous, but few, and there is much room for many more publishers. Undoubtedly the influence of the Catholic organization holds the people in subjection and if they could be reached more often and there were more publishers there to conduct studies with them they would soon see the way to eternal life. The witness given in the last twelve months is splendid and the report shows there were 37 pioneers working in these countries, and 394 company publishers; a total of 431. They have devoted 91,427 hours to the work; an increase of 10,000 hours over last year. The back-call activity is showing some improvement and 2,516 back-calls were made. Undoubtedly, when this work is increased and more studies are conducted with the people of good-will even greater increases in number of publishers will be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The companies in this territory increased from 16 to 23 during the year. There was a splendid distribution of literature, 342,553 pieces being placed in the hands of the people. Fortunately there was a good supply of literature on hand when the shipping problem made it practically impossible to send new supplies to South American countries. In South America there is a great field for activity, and some day the Lord may open up the way for special publishers who can speak the languages of these South American countries. In the countries mentioned in this report the principal language spoken is Spanish, but there are considerable numbers of Germans, Italians, and other language groups in South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Branch servant, among other things, reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our report for the last year is somewhat better than for previous years and we are under greater opposition by the adversary than at any time before. As it is to be expected, Catholic Action is causing plenty of trouble and has the approval of the government, so they do as they please. Nevertheless we are forging on and, by the Lord’s grace, have accomplished much more during the last year than in previous times, considering the difficult conditions that the people are going through due to war and other local conditions. It is our plan that the coming year be even better, and we will do our best as the people of good-will increase in numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It all depends on Jehovah, but if it is possible and it is His will to keep back the forces of evil for a while longer, then we will press on to give an even greater witness to the people of these lands. Nothing very serious has happened to us yet, and we hope we shall be let alone for further witnessing. Sometimes it is difficult for us to get all the literature to the various points ordering books and booklets, but in this time of war we can only do the best we can to keep our brethren supplied. The people of good-will are coming continually and, of course, it is encouraging to find them and have the privilege of pointing out to them the way of the Kingdom. It is a grand privilege, and it is a fact that such grand opportunities will never come again. It saddens one to see that some people that have had the opportunity of serving the Most High God let that grand opportunity pass by and do not seem to awaken to the fact that every means should be used to magnify Jehovah’s name and be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Now is the time to be a witness, and we hope that all will see their great privilege, that a greater number of people in this land can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 93 persons have been immersed in the countries in the southern part of South America. We are sorry that we could not follow up the great convention at Cleveland, Ohio, but on Sunday, September 20, we had a general meeting in the Society’s hall at Buenos Aires and there we resolved to put into operation any resolutions the organization makes as to serving Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. The detailed report for the countries under this Branch follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>AUSTRALASIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Australia and New Zealand has been banned by the governments for the past year. This, however, has not slowed down the zeal of the Lord’s servants. Being fully convinced that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness, and knowing that they must obey God rather than men, Jehovah’s witnesses in these lands will not stop or step aside and remain idle, but, by the Lord’s help and through Uis power, they have continued to fulfill their God-given commission. There are many people of good-will in Australasia and these are being hunted out and shown the truth and they are taking their stand definitely on the side of the Kingdom. In the lands under the jurisdiction of the Australasian Branch we now find 3,341 publishers reporting activity every month, on the average, to compare with 2,261 a year ago. This is a remarkable increase. Even though the Society’s property has been seized and those working in the office there were forced out to find other homes, the work continues. The organization instructions were received concerning the new work to begin more book studies and the organizing of companies. The brethren in this part of the world have taken this instruction very seriously and in the past year increased their back-calls from 51,000 to 116,000. This resulted in an increase in company organizations as well. In 1941 there were 172 companies, and now there are 195 organized companies. It is the determination on the part of all the publishers for the Kingdom in Australasia to make even more back-calls on the people of good-will and establish more book studies and companies, despite the ban. Australia claims to be a Christian nation and allows the study of the Bible, and Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones that are really doing it; and, by Jehovah’s grace, they are doing a good job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The situation existed in Australia quite similar to that in the United States and Britain in this, that Brother MacGillivray, who was Branch servant since 1930, finished his earthly course. There it was believed by the authorities that this faithful fighter’s being no longer with the Lord’s people would have a retarding effect on the work, the same as it was hoped by them in Britain that when Brother Schroeder was sent out of that country the work there would slow down, and in the United States when Brother Rutherford finished his course some thought the brethren would soon slack their hands. The rulers cannot see that this organization is not dependent on man, but depends only on Jehovah God and His favor. It is a matter of covenant individually with God that keeps a witness active. It is keen appreciation of the truth that makes him zealous. While Brother MacGillivray will be greatly missed, all rejoice that he too has received his reward for faithful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report sent in by the new servant of the Australasian territory is most interesting and will make glad the hearts of all the followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To Jehovah, our God, we offer thanks for the battle and the victory. This being a time of war, the many difficulties have been recognized as further opportunity for the ambassadors of The Theocracy to take the offensive, hold fast their integrity, and so share aright in the great issue of world domination. Truly the prophet has said: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.”—Isa. 54: 17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now more than eighteen months since the Hierarchy’s subverters tried to outlaw Christianity in Australasia, but the past eighteen months of battle have demonstrated to thousands of decent, order-loving British citizens that Jehovah’s witnesses are the most law-abiding people in these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the last report, mention was made of a writ served upon the Commonwealth Government of Australia, claiming that the suppression of Jehovah’s witnesses and certain corporations was ultra vires of Section 116 of the Constitution, which forbids the making of “any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion”. The High Court Case, which is to decide the validity or otherwise of the Commonwealth’s action, did not eventuate during the past year, but this has not affected the witness work, which increases and shall continue to increase until the final end. In the meantime the Menzies government has been thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other countries which have suffered at the hands of “the king of the south” are New Zealand, Fiji, Hong Kong, the Netherlands East Indies, Burma, and Malaya. The work in Indo-China and Thailand has been suppressed by the bloodthirsty “king of the north”, and now the Japanese invasion of all territories north of Australia has brought further hardship in its wake. The Lord had forewarned His servants that “both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief”; and we have therefore rejoiced in the fulfillment of the scripture, “But the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.” (Dan. 11:27,32) No matter what the fiery trial imposed by the adversary, opportunities have abounded to sound forth the glad tidings of The Theocracy, and the faithful have never so much as considered bowing to the will of the dictator. Striking proof of this was seen last June, when the Australasian field reported an all-time peak of 4,185 Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Devoted Servant: Early in January, we received news of Brother Rutherford’s passing away. This came as a shock to all, for we had dearly loved Brother Rutherford as a faithful fellow servant and fighter for The Theocracy. We rejoiced to learn that he died fighting, “with his boots on,” so to receive the crown of righteousness. Though we shall miss him we do not stop to sorrow as is the worldly custom, but shall work the harder in the Theocratic interest, pressing earnestly forward, the song of praise upon our lips, and The Theocracy our one, immediate and entire concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We recall with pleasure the great convention in Sydney, April 22-25, 1938, which was personally led by Brother Rutherford and which resulted in the mightiest public witness ever given in this land. The 25,000 people who assembled at the Sydney Sports Ground on Sunday, April 24, will long remember the “Warning” speech as a fearless testimony to the name of Almighty God. From that time forward the Kingdom work took on added impetus, and thousands of Australians have since flocked to the banner of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To yourself, Brother Knorr, as the new president, and to the brethren associated with you, we convey our loving greetings. This being the time of unity, we readily recognize the direction of the Lord in appointments pertaining to His “servant” company on earth, and shall count it a privilege to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with yourself and our other brethren in vindication of Jehovah’s name, and until the great THEOCRAT says: “It is done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Branch Servant Passes On : Our cup of sorrow was not yet full. On July 22, 1942, our beloved Brother MacGillivray finished his life-course on earth, and entered that higher</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sphere of service whither Brother Rutherford had so recently preceded him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year, and particularly since the murderous attempt on his life at Strathfleld, Brother MacGillivray had suffered from ill health, but it came as a great shock when medical specialists announced, early in July, that there was no hope of’ his recovery. We were indeed grateful for your comforting cablegram of July 16: “Regret illness. Be of good courage; trust in the Lord and claim His precious promises to those who love Him ... Be assured of my love, prayers, best wishes for your welfare. Keep me advised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since 1930, when he came to Australia from Brooklyn, Brother Mac, as he was affectionately known to all, faithfully devoted himself to the commission from Jehovah. (Rev. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5">: 10) During that time he fearlessly and valiantly directed the work in the face of many obstacles hurled by the opposers of The Theocracy, even abuse and vicious bodily injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Officialdom Advised: Brother Mac had always loved a fight; and though the heat of battle took heavy toll of his health, he was always seeking means to fling the challenge back in the enemy’s teeth. He was at his best in the many encounters with governmental heads. The Menzies government, notorious for its hatred of Christianity, was repeatedly lashed with the locusts’ sting. Just two weeks before its fall, the head of this government received the following lettergram, final reminder that the opposers must give account before the judgment seat of Almighty God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“According Press report, you as Prime Minister have under consideration bombardment Germany with Biblical quotations. In 1934, Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth warned Hitler and Nationalist Government that because of persecution Christians, Jehovah would destroy them. In 1938, Australia was warned of Hitler’s intentions in public speech at Sports Ground before audience 25,000 and relayed all states. Commonwealth refused radio facilities and newspapers contracted but failed publish speech. Since January 1941, Menzies Government has conspired against Christianity, locked up Bibles in rat-infested buildings, caused persecution Christians, refused importation Bibles. For such a Government to send Scriptural messages anywhere would be sheer hypocrisy. Commonwealth gunmen at my home who recently attempted murder myself and family are now supplied automatics to be more efficient. Commonwealth spends weekly upwards thousand pounds on suppression Christianity. Remember admonition Luke 6: 42, that before pointing at mote in another’s eye, behold beam in own. Hitler since 1934 has incarcerated 6,000 Jehovah’s witnesses. When he and fellow gangsters are dead, Jehovah’s witnesses, by God’s grace, will be singing Almighty’s praise. When his co-actionists here are dead, Jehovah’s witnesses will be hailing King of kings. Your government may as well attempt sweep back the ocean as prevent victorious march Jehovah’s Theocratic Kingdom. Political-religious or financial affiliations will avail nothing at Armageddon. Only hope God’s Kingdom, for which Jesus instructed Christians to pray. Copies communications to His Majesty and responsible officials here, sent under separate cover to yourself and members of Parliament. All must now choose whether for Jehovah or against Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Fearlessly and undismayed for The Theocracy, “[Signed] MacGillivray.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will notice that the closing sentences of the lettergram mention that copies of various communications were forwarded individually to members of Parliament. Many of the latter acknowledged these, and several, in replying, went so far as to wish us well in the fight for freedom. Members of the ruling Labor government appear to have adopted a more tolerant attitude than their predecessors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Envoy to London ; In October, 1941, Brother H. E. Gill set out for London. The purpose of his visit was to advise competent authorities in Britain concerning the Hierarchy’s suppression of freedom in Australia and New Zealand, and that the British government might be given an opportunity to strike a blow for the cause of righteousness. While we await action in this regard, it is gratifying that the journey has already achieved other far-reaching results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notably, w<sup>r</sup>e mention the improved contact with yourself, which has been rendered possible through Brother Gill’s visit to Brooklyn, also the valuable opportunity of becoming more fully advised concerning the method and progress of the work in America and Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Theocratic Victory : The Assembly convened at Hargrave Park, Sydney, December 25-29,1941, must be regarded as one of the greatest Theocratic victories ever won in this land. When we received news of the marvelous provision made for our brethren at St. Louis and at Leicester, possibility of a “Children” assembly in Australia appeared remote. Imagine, therefore, our unbounded joy when the Lord not only directed the preparation of a similar feast in Sydney, but led his people step by step to participate in each one of the many special blessings provided at St. Louis!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, Satan and his dupes tried every means possible to prevent the assembly from being held. Less than twelve months previously, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, acting through its filthy press and fifth column, had succeeded, so it thought, in administering the death-blow to Jehovah’s witnesses. But the thoughts of Jehovah God are to the vindication of his name, and his servants in Australia followed willingly the Theocratic direction as he proceeded to confound the enemy. It was a grand fight all the way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Defeating the Adversary: Wartime conditions promised increased difficulties, and the obstacles were not diminished by Japan’s entry into the war several weeks prior to the date set for our convention. The government, requiring all transport facilities in view of the state of emergency, directed that holiday interstate rail travel be canceled, and for a time it appeared that the brethren from other states would be unable to attend. However, preparations went ahead in the anticipation that this would be the greatest assembly ever, and in due course the conventioners arrived —trainloads from Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the farthermost state, West Australia, refused rail facilities to intending conventioners. With petrol rationing in force, it would have seemed impossible to make the 3,000-mile trip to Sydney; but the West Australian boys did not think so, and they overcame this obstacle in true Samson style. They set busily to work equipping their cars with gas-producer units, and by the time of setting out, on December 11, had placed nine cars and trucks on the road, ready tuned for 6,000 miles 'there and baek’. A West Australian Kingdom farm supplied charcoal to carry the eonvoy over the desert-crossing of 1,700 miles to Adelaide. The entire journey to Sydney took fourteen days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For one solid week, the travelers were required to endure the hardships of the Nullabor desert. Hair and clothes became clogged with dirt, and washing in the limited supply of water only sufficed to turn the dirt into mud. Cars were required to stop and refuel every fifty miles. Some of the slower-moving vehicles drove 24 hours a day, the drivers taking duty in shifts, eating and sleeping as the convoy moved forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the start of the desert-crossing, and in the dead of night, military, police and Fuel Board officials swooped down on the encamped convoy, removing every drop of emergency petrol. The pettiness and crass stupidity of this action is apparent when it is realized that these officials must have wasted 50 gallons of petrol traveling out from Perth. They confiscated a meager 6 gallons! Undaunted, the little band of publishers shouldered the task imposed, pushing the first car two or three miles each morning until it was started on charcoal gas, and returning to assist this car in towing the others up to the start. While Fuel Board officials made loud public prophecies concerning “rescue parties”, the convoy’s mechanic was repairing the only real trouble encountered in the desert—a broken-down military truck. And were the army boys grateful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s watch-care and protection were manifest in a shower of rain which for several days preceded the travelers across the desert, and in unseasonable cross-winds, without which passengers and vehicles would have been smothered in dust. Much to the amazement of “the world”, the “West Aussies” were on time for the opening session of the Assembly !</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, six months later, the following report comes to hand from Perth. On July 22 a representative body of West Australian citizens met to consider means of opening up motor transport across the desert to the eastern states. They professed themselves “stumped”. Then someone mentioned that Jehovah’s witnesses had made the journey by gasproducer convoy, and it was resolved that the meeting be adjourned until one of Jehovah’s witnesses could be brought in to give his respected opinion. The brother who enjoyed this privilege gave a grand testimony to The Theocratic Government, explaining that the Lord’s people are accustomed to overcoming such obstacles by the power and favor of Jehovah God. Incidentally, he supplied practical details which were of inestimable value to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it is seen that the course of action of these brethren continues to be made known throughout the length and breadth of Australia, all of which has further honored Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Newspaper Comment: Modern newspapers are like their father the Devil. (John 8:44) A leading Sydney daily, in its issue of December 14, 1941, described the company of 54 witnesses as a party of tramps traveling by “dribs and drabs” in “dilapidated vehicles” and “nursing miserable children”. Ten days later this same news-“rag” reported: “Fifty Jehovah’s witnesses stranded in the West Australian desert through lack of fuel for their cars are continuing the journey to Adelaide on foot . . . Progress was slow, because of frequent breakdowns of decrepit vehicles . . . The party was 450 miles east of Kalgoorlie (W. A.) when last heard of. The witnesses had money, and apparently were buying food from natives and navvies. All the cars had been abandoned on the road.” Yet not one word did the Sydney press add when, that very same night, the entire convoy drove triumphantly into Hargrave Park, having completed a journey which ranks with the greatest feats of the pioneers of this nation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the majority stooped to cheap slander, repetition of which would serve no good purpose, one paper saw fit to throw over the shackles of Roman Catholic censorship and to declare for freedom of worship. That paper is the Perth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span><span class="font5"> In an editorial of December 18, 1941, and in a front-page feature on January 9, 1942, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span><span class="font5">made known the true facts of the hazardous journey. The editorial reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Jehovah’s witnesses on Trek</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is regrettable that in these times, when the world is fighting for freedom, including religious freedom, there should be found sections of the Australian Press willing to throw inferential jibes at a band of religionists who, at much personal sacrifice, are making a hazardous journey across the Continent to satisfy their higher beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The undertaking of such a journey, in such circumstances, may be questionable material wisdom, but it is not an issue for cheap and flippant publicity. The ‘mob’ was equally flippant when Jesus was crucified, and martyrs by the thousand have died scorned by their ignorant fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is reasonable to imagine that this religious sect, stung by accusations of disloyalty in the official banning of their organization, are anxious to make special sacrifices to ‘carry the cross’ for their faith. The creed is not a disloyal creed, though its teaching is opposed to war, as war. Short of endorsing war, they may be the most loyal people in Australia. We do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But we do know that a faith that will endure hardships in crossing an inhospitable continent, by almost primitive means, to participate in a religious conference, has a ‘punch’ that is worthy of respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If ill befalls the gallant little band, then the authorities who denied them the safe hire of a railway carriage will be able to accept their measure of moral responsibility. Australia is not so pressed for transport that she could not afford that measure of safety and comfort for men, women and children pledged to ‘honour their God before all men’. In existing world circumstances, an extra official effort to respect the God that these people were anxious to honour would have done Australia no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Whether they approve the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses or otherwise, all decent-minded people will wait to learn with relief of the safe arrival of the struggling little band of religionists at their distant destination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report of January 9 appeared under large headlines : “Jehovah’s witnesses Serenade Sydney, Cross the Continent, Break Axles, Uphold the Constitution and Overcome ‘Man’s Leadership’.” This article dealt both with the Commonwealth action of January 17, 1941, and the Assembly victory of December 25-29,1941. Here are some extracts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Nothing that Jehovah’s witnesses said paralleled the damage done to the earlier war effort by party politicians who, pursuing their own party political views, had the blind inconsistency to condemn and outlaw this religious sect for holding to their view ‘that God has given Christ the earth’, and in that leadership alone lay the hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“However partisan may be the views of Jehovah’s witnesses (and they certainly can present a very ‘anti’ attitude to other religious faiths when they are in the mood), they at least rise above personal ambitions, so that their influence against national unity was much less destructive than the ambitions of party politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah’s witnesses have their bottle of Truth, drawn from the common Well. They carried it all the way across Australia (a formidable-looking implement in the hands of devout and determined men and women), so that in the last resort, the Government, feeling that discretion was the better part of valour (and peace) withdrew the ban on the congress, and with certain official face-saving reservations, allowed the conference to go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In Aussie vernacular, it was a clinker. Such singing! Such praying! Such emphasis upon the only recognizable authority of a righteous government—Christ; and impliedly, and forthrightly, Christ through the mediumship of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Back to the trek from Western Australia across Australia with the Devil and his legions on the tail of the sand-swept convoy, sniping as cruelly at axles and the like as ever German or Japanese bomber sniped a defenceless convoy’s rudders on the ocean wave ... It might almost seem that the Devil and his legions were pursuing the party; if so, Old Nick was beaten to a frazzle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There followed a detailed account of the journey, the assembly itself and a section on the St. Louis convention, including Brother Rutherford’s closing remarks which discounted charges that he was the “leader of Jehovah’s witnesses”. The Perth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> is to be commended on its respect for the Constitution and on its bold advocacy of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Battle Royal: In the meantime, a tough battle was in progress at the convention site. Public halls being out of the question for Christian assemblies, the convention organizers chose an admirably suited block of land, property of one of the brethren, and situated near the railway, some eighteen miles from the heart of Sydney. Within a few days of start</span><span class="font5">ing, the builders erected large sections of the cafeteria and accompanying plant. The local Liverpool council immediately showed fight, and demanded that all buildings be demolished forthwith. The carpenters, plumbers and painters, however, took this as notice to redouble their efforts, and the work of preparation was augmented as fresh volunteers arrived to lend a hand. In due course the buildings were completed, and played a grand part in caring for the con-ventioners. As a last resort, the council tried to deprive the convention of sanitary conveniences, but in this, also, they failed. The assembly marquees, with seating accommodation for 6,000, the cafeteria buildings and the camping site were all situated within convenient distance on the one ground, and the surrounding trees and green fields provided an admirable setting for an assembly of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On December 23, just two days before the assembly, we were officially notified that the assembly had been banned. The newspapers carried the story in their headlines. Legal counsel recommended a cancellation in view of the drastic measures which they were assured would be used against the Society’s executives, but Brother MacGillivray indicated that already thousands of conventioners were on the way, and that therefore, if only for this reason, cancellation was out of the question. That same afternoon it was threatened that the “leaders” of Jehovah’s witnesses would be interned if the “show” went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly before midnight, the commissioner of police for New South Wales, Mr. MacKay, called personally at the Theocratic Embassy, Strathfield, and spent some hours discussing the situation with Brother MacGillivray. This interview appeared to convince the commissioner that Jehovah’s witnesses merely wished to exercise those rights to which they are entitled, including freedom to gather in Christian assembly. In the light of quiet reasoning the clouds lifted, and police who attended the sessions reported to the solicitorgeneral that “there were no breaches of decorum, nor any offensive or objectionable conduct or remarks, and that only religious exercises were observed”. Six thousand lovers of righteousness had their convention!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The police commissioner, who is a firm believer in the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, posted his men on the convention property to guard against interference by hooligans and mobsters. It is a pleasure to record these points in recognition that some high officials still respect Christianity and are willing to lend a hand in the battle against dictatorial rule, which is Theocratic enemy No. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Assembly: In every respect, the Hargrave Park assembly was a miniature St. Louis. The many discourses covered the same ground, not only in reviewing recent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles, but also in preparing the way for the new work, “to comfort all that mourn.” There is no question that an abundant measure of the spirit of the Lord was poured out upon the assembly, and that this resulted in dissolving finally any doubts and uncertainty still remaining from the Commonwealth action. Each one appreciated that a tremendous work must yet be done, and this was reflected immediately in positive action throughout this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The theme of the assembly was represented in a large painting of the 1941 calendar, placed prominently above the speakers’ platform. Above the picture the words “Demon Rule Ending” and a large clock set at one minute to twelve indicated the nearness of the hour of complete vindication. A mass immersion in a near-by river saw 243 new publishers, including 135 children, symbolize their consecration. The “new work” was getting off to a flying start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">High-points of the assembly were two inspiring talks by the Branch servant. Brother Mac’s health had been failing for some time, and hence it came as a source of great joy to all conventioners to find him “up and about”, and able to exhort the assembly to push forward to greater efforts. Crowning triumph was “Children’s Day”, Sunday, December 28, when Brother Mac addressed 700 youngsters and 5,300 other conventioners on the subject “Children of The King”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the Monday, release of the Australian edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> provided an unexpected and thrilling conclusion to the assembly. Even in normal times the preparation of a bound book would have presented great difficulties; but that this task should be accomplished under the “ban” and within five short weeks is a wonderful testimony to Kingdom effort. With the exception of the binding, the Australian edition is an exact replica of the American book, and is complete with color plates and other illustrations, all of which were redrawn by one of the Australian brethren. In the face of overwhelming odds, the printers did a job which could have been completed only by consecrated labor and in the strength of the Lord. Each child received his gift, and 20,000 of the book are now in circulation throughout Australasia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly following the assembly, we were able to publish a 78-page magazine, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Jehovah’s witnesses Assembly.</span><span class="font5"> This report covered the memorable gatherings at St. Louis, U.S.A., Leicester, England, and Sydney, Australia. Again, the artist did valuable service in reproducing the cover-illustrations of the American magazine. The report has been read with interest by the publishers and has been of great benefit in showing the people of good-will how the Theocratic organization operates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In considering the many aspects of the convention victory, we are reminded of David’s words: “Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods? And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.” —2 Sam. 7: 22-24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Theocratic Embassy” Invaded: The Society’s Australasian headquarters were established at Strathfield on January 14, 1929, and during thirteen years have grown from a single dwelling-house to a large collection of buildings, incorporating office, printery, bulk stores, dispatch, laundry, bakery, modern kitchen and dining-room, garages, etc. At the time of the government’s “ban”, January 17, 1941, the Bethel family numbered more than 100 souls, and the name “Strathfield” was inseparably linked with that of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the “ban”, several buildings were placed under lock and key, but the family were permitted to remain, and Bethel was the center from which the post-“ban” fight emanated. Despite inconveniences imposed and violence committed by so-called “peace officers”, the work prospered, and the family was increased to meet new requirements of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On May 8, 1942, the Bethel family received 24 hours’ notice to leave the premises. Considerable hardship was encountered in carrying out the order on time, and the blow was most keenly felt, not only by the family whose home it was, but also by the brethren throughout the Commonwealth, all of whom looked upon Bethel as the “Lord’s House”. The Theocracy has always triumphed over the world in “getting things done”; hence the world’s eagerness to invade the territory of the “holy covenant” and to seize for its own use the up-to-date equipment provided by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren have now taken up residence in other homes, and are rejoicing to press ever forward, rejoicing that the “Theocratic Embassy” stood and still stands as a testimony to the name of Jehovah and to the devotion of His servants. It is by Jehovah’s permission that we have suffered this loss —a further token of “Christendom’s” impending doom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s Provision : By the Lord’s grace, every publisher and interested person has been supplied wifh the “meat in due season”. At this perilous hour, when such provision is most needful, the windows of heaven have opened wider than ever, and there is indeed ‘no room to receive’ all that our heavenly Father has so graciously provided. (Mal. 3 : 10) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> the Study Course folders, the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hope, </span><span class="font5">the 1942 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> and Calendar, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font5"> regular issues of tbe </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> series on Daniel’s prophecy, “Final Gathering,” and the complete issue of “Micah”—all have appeared in printed form and have been thoroughly enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Daniel’s prophecy concerning the two “kings” and the triumph of The Theocracy at the final end provided wonderful stimulus for the post-“ban” work. With each issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> the vision of the militant Theocracy and the servant’s privilege in withstanding the ‘violators of the covenant’ has become more glorious. While ‘pressing the battle to the gate’, we rejoice in the prospect of a share in ‘tidings out of the east and north’ and of meeting the faithful men as they stand in their lot and take over the reins of the visible righteous rule on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The timely message of Jeremiah’s prophecy and the series on Micah have sustained us further. Truly the great “House of Bread with Fruitfulness” is now established and the faithful “stand and feed in the strength of Jehovah”, confident that he will supply their every need if they maintain integrity by consistent action in the field. Now we are getting to work, in more senses than one, on the “Song-Call to Action” and “Defeat of Persecution”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As each publisher shoulders his individual burden he realizes that there are three duties requiring constant attention; namely, diligent study, earnest prayer, and faithful service. By looking well to his responsibility in these three respects he presses towards the prize of salvation concerning which the apostle wrote: “Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.”— 1 Pet. 1, 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Service Year in Australia: Outstanding event in the field of service was the inauguration of the “new work” outlined in Brother Rutherford’s letter of October 24, and in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> article entitled “Final Gathering”. With singleness of purpose, the modern-day Jeremiah class have organized thoroughly to search out every nook, cranny and farthermost corner of this great continent. We are assured that the Lord’s “other sheep” are to be “hunted” and “fished” everywhere. By the Lord’s grace, the ‘hunting’ and ‘fishing’ is well under way, and is proceeding towards its goal, namely, the establishment of a company of Jehovah’s witnesses in every town and village in the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In line with the instruction contained in Brother Rutherford’s letter, the Society immediately appointed experienced pioneers as special publishers in towns which had no representation. The number of companies in Australia has since increased from 130 to 159. Special publishers have been supplied with ample equipment in the way of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children, Children</span><span class="font5"> study folders, and (most wonderful recent provision!) the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Children” Study Questions</span><span class="font5"> booklet. Since the inception of this service the average monthly figures are: Active publishers, 93; hours, 137.7; and back-calls, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have long recognized that the main objectives in the field are more publishers, more hours, and more back-calls. Not only in the special publisher service, but in all branches of Kingdom activity, progress in these important spheres has been remarkable, which fact is clearly borne out by the following table. In making comparison, it must be remembered that the first six months of the previous fiscal year were “full-steam ahead”, without “ban” or any serious hindrance.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, while we regret the loss of our literature, we continue to rejoice in fresh avenues of service and in the “increase of His Government”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been most thrilling to watch the development of the back-call and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study work. Under the prevailing conditions, back-calls are stressed from the moment the people are first met at the doors, and for this purpose a special testimony card, approximately twice the size of the usual, has been prepared. One side of the card contains the introduction, and, additionally, a number of topical questions which the reader is invited to have answered at a “home Bible study”. The other side sets forth the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> foreword, entitled “The Scriptures Clearly Teach” and, additionally, sufficient Bible references to establish the points of doctrine. This “card” study is demonstrated on the doorstep, and, when the back-call is arranged, is taken up at the first return visit. Up to this stage, the only equipment required is the card and the Bible, and even a dyed-in-the-wool Roman Catholic fifth columnist could find no occasion against that! When genuine interest is established, the publisher presents the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> and proceeds with the regular </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there were no prosecutions on the grounds of the witness work. In one country town it was learned that frequent complaints to police headquarters were invariably met with the answer, “We have nothing on Jehovah’s witnesses. If you think they’re a nuisance, you’ll just have to put up with them!” Another town took drastic action against six boys from a near-by Kingdom farm. The boys were arrested and held overnight under National Security Regulations, while a rabid sergeant charged them with being German and Japanese spies, fifth columnists, etc. Police headquarters in Sydney made investigations, were satisfied as to their bona tides, and ordered the release of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the Assembly, regional and zone servants did valuable work in reviving the companies and building up the organization to meet fresh demands. Each of the 130 companies in Australia was represented at The Theocratic Assembly. The opportunity providing, all company servants were assembled one evening to receive confidential instructions regarding the “new work” and to hear words of encouragement from Brother Mac. The campaign inaugurated at this assembly has never looked back. Never before in the progress of the “strange work” have the Australasian publishers demonstrated such appreciation of the issue, such unity and eagerness for the battle, as at this present hour. During the month of July, the Sydney company alone attained a new peak of 1,027 publishers, to compare with 648 in the best month before the “ban”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday, July 26, four days after Brother Mac’s death, a united meeting of the Sydney company assembled at Hargrave Park to consider preparation for the extensive work ahead. Although only two days’ notice was given, the attendance reached 1,300. The assembly was advised that some days before he passed away Brother MacGillivray had executed a legal document, delegating his Powers of Attorney to Philip Rees until such time as the president should make an appointment. Your cable received on July 27 conferred this authority, and, by the Lord’s grace, I have since endeavored to push forward the work with all diligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year’s report for Australia is as follows: Books, 11,434; booklets, 15,284; total literature, 26,718; average publishers, 2,839; peak of publishers (June), 3,766; hours, 570,550; new subscriptions, 218; individual magazines, 44,093; sound attendance, 5,271; back-calls, 98,965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Memorial : The memorial of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ was observed by all companies and isolated brethren on Tuesday, March 31, after 6 p.m. Reports to hand reveal a total attendance of at least 2,960, of whom 477 partook. The figures indicate that while the earthly remnant decreases, those who will form the “great multitude” are increasing by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The celebration at the Theocratic Embassy was attended by the enemy in the form of two of the “evil servant” class. These sat in the front row, partook of the emblems, and, after the meeting, made themselves known by attempting to distribute anti-Theoeratic and objectionable leaflets. A few minutes later they had been quietly deposited several hundred yards down the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bethel Family : Throughout a most difficult year, the Bethel family has stuck manfully to its task, not only of faithful performance of daily duties, but also in putting forth diligent efforts in the field during the week-ends and evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Preparation for 1942 Assembly: At the time of writing, we are busy making ready for the 1942 Theocratic Assembly. You will be pleased to learn that arrangements are well in hand for adding seven Australian and three New Zealand cities to the other assemblies throughout the world. A representative from the Bethel family will attend at each point in Australia, and, further, a recorded talk has been made and distributed to all ten cities, so that these may be tied together for the closing session of this season of fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1942 assembly will fulfill an important purpose in comforting the Lord’s people and the countless ‘mourners’ who are now taking courage in the Theocratic promises.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In New Zealand the singers for the Kingdom sing loud and long. Because they do this they get into trouble with the authorities. It is reported that 50 singers are now held in a detention camp because of faithful service. Even here they have many opportunities that are cause for rejoicing and it is reported that some who have entered these detention camps not Jehovah’s witnesses will certainly leave as such, because of the fine work that is being done in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom in prison. The work in New Zealand has been disrupted as in many other countries, but the brethren are holding on to their rights to worship God and will not let the political powers encroach on their lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a splendid increase in publishers, from 264 in 1941 to 391 in 1942. They have more than doubled their hours in the past year, putting in 114,967 hours in field service. Almost all of this was in back-call activity, and the conducting of studies. They can go from house to house with the Bible, but they are not allowed to interest anyone so much as to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, nominally. Their back-call work has almost tripled; over 20,000 back-calls were made. Here is a small band of covenant-keeping servants of God doing much work under difficult conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local servant in New Zealand, under the main branch in Australia, sends in the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results have been accomplished in the face of the obstacles placed in our way by officials in their efforts to enforce the conditions of the ban placed upon true Christianity by the government of this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As perhaps you are aware, we have had difficulties in connection with the distribution of even the Bible itself. In some places the police take action on the plea that they are not opposing the distribution of the Bible, but they are opposing the house-to-house visits by Jehovah’s witnesses, because such, they claim, is participating in the activities of a subversive organization. The ‘crime’ is contacting the people, a thing we must do, because such is ‘a danger to the country’. In Dunedin the magistrate has twice convicted our brethren who were merely witnessing with the Bible. In the most recent case, which we have appealed, the sister concerned had not even identified herself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The person approached did not give her a chance, but phoned the police, who, in turn, sent along five men to deal with a ‘grave national danger’ in the shape of a poor little woman, a lover of righteousness, who was trying to interest the people in the study of the Bible. We are appealing this case because we have had three recent prosecutions decided in our favor, and we believe that if we get a favorable decision in a higher court it might result in less interference by the police, which is definitely persecution and not prosecution. I am enclosing some news clippings dealing with the various cases. Some of the testimony given by the police witnesses was definitely false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a case at New Plymouth two brothers making a back-call were confronted by the police on making a second visit. Their efforts to honor the name of Jehovah were followed by a prosecution and sentence to a month’s imprisonment each. They were found ‘guilty of participating in the activities of a subversive organization’. In two succeeding cases the same magistrate refused to convict brethren who were prosecuted because they approached the people with the Bible. He pointed out that work with the Bible was common to all religious bodies, and that merely because the one attempting to place a Bible claimed to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses did not prove that he was taking part in the activities of a subversive organization. In other words, the magistrate’s ruling seemed to say that the activities of a subversive organization must be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">subversive</span><span class="font5"> activities before such activities could be classed as a breach of the War Safety Emergency Regulations. We are pursuing the matter along these lines in our future defense in the courts. In no prosecution of our brethren has evidence of subversive activities been submitted. If any of our brethren are caught witnessing with ‘J. F. Rutherford publications’ the magistrate is not required to judge the case. He merely convicts and imposes a prison sentence, which usually amounts to three months. Because our organization has been branded subversive, the possession of the publications of the Society and distribution thereof is severely punished. Courts will not examine the publications to determine whether they are subversive. That point has already been decided by decree issued by the attorney general. However, in spite of the obstacles, the “sheep” are being fed and all the brethren here are keyed up to increase their activities so that the Lord’s “other sheep” may be quickly located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two special publisher sisters were victims of action by stupid and ignorant police. A woman professing interest and friendliness while being witnessed phoned the police after the witnesses left her. Results soon showed up in the shape of two policemen, one of whom was very abusive and insulting to our sisters. A report of the policeman’s words was written out while fresh in the memory, and a copy was sent to Wellington office, while another copy was retained by the sister. Later the police issued a summons which caught up on our sisters after they had moved on to another town. They were arrested and held in custody four days awaiting trial. By the Lord’s grace, the trial was heard by a fair-minded magistrate and he rejected one point after another of the police evidence against us. The police had seized all the private papers and letters in the possession of the sisters, included in which was the report on the abusive constable. It so transpired that this was all read out in the court, much to the discomfiture of the constable concerned. This magistrate dismissed the case and ruled that the police would have to prove something subversive was being done to constitute their activities as those belonging to a subversive organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are going ahead with the worship of Almighty God in accordance with the instructions through his organization. (Matt. 24:14; Acts 20: 20) Like David, we are feasting in the presence of the enemy, and we rejoice in the privilege of receiving abundant and regular supplies of spiritual food from the Lord’s table, notwithstanding the serious interruption to the lines of communication. ‘It is the Lord’s doing, and is marvelous in our eyes.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are thirteen special publishers in this country at present. The number has been reduced, owing to the taking of so many boys to the detention camps. However, we are hoping that others will join the ranks as a result of the world-wide Theocratic Assembly just concluded. Here in New Zealand we assembled at Wellington, Auckland, and Christchurch. When the Assembly was proposed there were in existence travel restrictions making it necessary to obtain a permit before undertaking a journey exceeding 100 miles. Then came a coal strike, with the imposition of much more severe restrictions. From all reports this did not seriously affect the attendance at the convention and the friends got a thrill out of the extra effort made to be present. Two brothers, whose efforts to travel were frustrated at every turn, started out on the 150 miles between their home and Wellington. They walked only about two miles and covered the rest quickly by car and train in a manner that was pleasing, yet gratefully accepted as a blessing from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wo did not receive the outline of your program in time for use here, and hence we made up a uniform program for the three New Zealand cities. On the last day of the Assembly we were thrilled to receive a recorded speech made by the Branch servant in Australia, Brother Rees, giving a parting exhortation to all brethren to aim for a company of active publishers in every town and hamlet in the country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>THE FAR EAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In former years, this Branch has forwarded a detailed report for each of the countries, Netherlands East Indies, Malaya, Burma, Indo-China, Thailand, and Hong Kong. More recently, these territories have been overrun by the ruthless Japanese aggressors, with the result that Jehovah’s witnesses have suffered cruel indignities and violation of their right to proclaim the Theocrat and His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one doubts that the Nipponese emperor and his warlords are the agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in its frantic grab for world control. Not only is Japan a partner in the Vatican-inspired Axis combine, but she has recently entered into diplomatic relations and exchanged ambassadors with the pope,—a step which has shocked many right-thinking Australian Catholics. Further, the public press has cited several instances of priestly connivance with the invading Japs. It is reported that a Roman Catholic bishop in the Solomons dressed up in “holy” regalia and paraded on the beach to meet his buck-toothed comrades, and that the Roman Catholic bishop of Singapore was among the first to congratulate the conquering Japanese general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The way of righteousness has always been hard in these far-flung lands: now it is harder still. However, the incomplete reports which have filtered through hear record of a determination to honor the name of the Most High, regardless of consequences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>WESTERN CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Three Australian pioneers, who traveled the famous Burma Road last year, have done considerable work in the districts of Chungking, Chunming and Chengfu. Continual air raids, sometimes as many as eight in one day, have caused great slaughter and rendered it difficult to work continuously in the field. The pioneers completed a splendid job, placing their entire stock of literature, and have recently found their way to India, whence they are returning to Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of these brethren writes as follows: “The air slaughter that has been carried on in the last few months has not dampened our zeal, but, knowing ‘this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached unto all the world as a witness’, we are going on until He says, ‘Enough.’ Many letters have been coming in, inquiring about the good news the Theocratic ambassadors are bringing to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The missionaries here have died a sudden death. They are all out to see how much money they can make on other work, and it has been reported that the few so-called ‘Christians’ are looking for a good preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We had been in Chungking two days when the Devil and his crowd tried to blow up our Kingdom literature. He succeeded in bombing all around, with the result that the house was surrounded by debris, but the house itself was still standing, only a little shattered, thanks to the Higher Powers. It needs a great amount of energy to climb these mountainous hills, with scorching weather conditions just now; but what is that to Kingdom publishers? We go on witnessing until the planes come over. Then it is time to take a rest in the fields and watch them drop their ‘rotten eggs’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Field service reports received from these three brethren up to the end of January (six months) show that they worked 1,712 hours in the field, placed 918 books, 3,011 booklets, 1,765 magazines, and 27 subscriptions, conducted back-calls to the number of 44, and had 20 sound attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year has been one of considerable difficulty. Although the British authorities had banned the Kingdom literature in May, 1941, much work was accomplished between that time and the Japanese invasion on January 18, 1942. On that same date, the Society’s representative in Rangoon was able to leave on the last plane to get through to Australia by the Netherlands East Indies route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For more than six months, Brother Engel was subjected to abuse and interference. The king’s representative issued an order for his deportation, and for an entire month he remained under protective custody, pending the execution of the order. Brother Engel exercised his right of appeal to a special board, composed of European judges of the High Court of Rangoon, and the trial, whieh was held in camera, resulted in cancellation of the governor’s decree. Following this victory, he traveled the Burma Road to Chungking. While he was in China the governor prepared another order, prohibiting his re-entry into British Burma until after the present war. However, delay occasioned by official “red tape” permitted him to slip back into Burma several days before the order came into force. Shortly thereafter he was again detained by the Rangoon police, who demanded that he leave the country. Brother Engel argued rightly that in view of the High Court decision, and the fact that he was already in the country, the new order was null and void. It took the police another month to decide that nothing more would be done in the matter, after which he was free to go as he pleased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Detailed figures for the Burmese service year are not available, but it is known that in the six months before the invasion placements of literature approximated 1,500 Bibles, books and booklets, while hundreds of back-calls were made by the 40 publishers. Over 40 cartons of literature are safely deposited in the jungle, and will be faithfully used by native Burmese publishers who have already shown integrity under “ban” conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So-called Britishers who howl “fifth column” at Jehovah’s witnesses might hang their heads in shame were they to learn of the deeds of heroism and work of comfort performed by the Lord’s people during the perilous days of the invasion. The Martaban company servant, Brother Sydney B. Coote, stayed faithfully at his post of duty as stationmaster, while Roman Catholic employees, who had slandered him on account of the truth, fled helter-skelter for the bush. Brother Coote’s devotion to duty was recognized by the British government’s high award of the O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire). This brother later joined the crowd of refugees which made the 500-mile jungle trek from Rangoon to India, but succumbed to an attack of cerebral malaria at the Indian border. His two daughters, aged 11 and 13, survived to join the brethren in India. One English brother was shot dead by a Jap, and another lost his wife and family when their house was bombed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A recent letter from India states as follows: “I wanted you to know and rejoice that we had got out of Burma, most of us, and are in India, where we are still able to go on proclaiming God’s name. The place we are in is a furnace, full of evacuees here, and water scarce—some days barely enough for a wash, let alone a bath, and what with the heat of the sun on top and the heat of the sand below, it is like the ‘hell’ of the religionists. Both R----and I were able to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">get to Bombay for the Memorial and to report for further field service. We are now special publishers. India is a very vast place, and thq harvest is plentiful but the laborers few.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although we may not hear from Burma again in the near future, we can be sure that the brethren who remain will continue to witness as they have opportunity. They have suffered much, but through it all they have rejoiced in the Lord’s salvation, and the Song of Victory is always on their lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thailand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Thais fell early victims to the Japanese conquest. A letter of late August, 1941, reported that the work was going ahead well, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and portions of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">were being published in Thai, and, in addition, sections of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> Three companies were established, and approximately 25 publishers were in the field. At the end of November, 1941, two days before the invasion, the Rangoon office received word that all was prospering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The International Red Cross recently advised that one of the pioneer brothers had been interned by the Japanese, and this, of course, is further proof that the Japs, in common with their allies of Vatican City, hate everyone who faithfully proclaims the truth. It is believed that the Society’s Far Eastern representative, who was in Thailand at the outbreak of hostilities, has suffered a like fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Netherlands East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office in Batavia was closed towards the end of 1941. Despite most difficult conditions, the publishers who remain in that land have done an extensive work with the Bibles, and, as opportunity afforded, the Kingdom literature. Back-calls appear to have shown a marked increase, but no detailed figures are available. Now the Jap has added these islands to his collection of scalps, and it is to be expected that our companions-in-service have suffered hardship and indignities similarly as in Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our last contact with these brethren was during January, 1942, when the servant from Rangoon was met by publishers at landing-points in the Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the Malayan government banned the Society’s literature in April, 1941, several publications in the vernacular were not affected and the publishers were free to continue the work with the aid of the phonographs and Bibles. Under pressure, many of the Asiatic brethren fell away, but the majority continued to assemble for study and to carry on the field service. During the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the work continued in Singapore. Later, many of the European brethren were evacuated, but one family remains to carry forward the work and we are confident that they are still doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No word has been received from French Indo-China, Hong Kong or Fiji. It is believed that a number of the brethren are active in those parts. One Australian brother returned to Shanghai last year, and is now associated with that office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Summary : The combined report for the Australasian territories has been rendered incomplete, due to many countries’ being overrun and the unavoidable difficulty of communication. Nevertheless, the figures which appear below supply </span><span class="font5">indisputable evidence that The Theocracy has advanced, despite the enemy’s endeavor to cut off the food supply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The above report consists of Australia, 12 months’ report; New Zealand, 10 months’ report; Western China, 8 months’ report; Burma, 3 months’ report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The determined Hierarchy-inspired effort to starve out the people of good-will has met with complete failure. Enforced falling away of literature placements will not affect the issue, for already 13,474,000 books and booklets have been distributed throughout Australasia, and a limited but sufficient quantity of “the latest” is always available. Like the great stones placed in the river Jordan (Joshua 4:9), the literature now stands as an enduring testimony and provides a solid basis on which to establish the “new work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rather than place great quantities of literature, the present endeavor is to feed the Lord’s “other sheep” by means of the back-call and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study work. The figures for 1942 show that return visits have more than doubled in one year. By the Lord’s grace, this great campaign shall increase from day to day and from week to week, and the song of praise shall swell until every righteousness-loving person in these lands has entered upon the highway to Zion and is sharing in the active service of the great Theocrat, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are upward of 40 million people in this vast country. Many languages are spoken. Portuguese is the national language. There is much work to be done there. The small group of publishers that are there now is doing excellent work, there being an increase in the year from 206 to 338 publishers in the field. It can easily be seen that these 338 publishers have a tremendous task to reach the population of Brazil; but they are doing the best they can. If in the Lord’s providence the “four freedoms” that the United Nations are fighting for are put into effect and the opportunity is opened for a short season to expand the preaching of the gospel, Jehovah’s witnesses will be the first ones to take advantage of the privileges so that they may aid the people of good-will in some of these countries. Brazil offers wonderful opportunities in this respect. Undoubtedly there are many people still to be reached who will take their stand definitely on the side of the Lord if they are given the opportunity to learn of the Kingdom. A very interesting report from the Branch servant in Brazil is herewith set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another year of Theocratic service has ended, during which time Jehovah has graciously extended to those few of his faithful servants in this land the inestimable privilege of holding forth The Theocracy as the only light in the midst of earth’s ever-thickening gloom. Some have responded to the light, have quickly entered the service, joyfully taking up the message “Come” while there is yet opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The field report enclosed shows an increase of 39 percent in total publishers, although the peak of pioneers was slightly below that of last year. The pioneers in Rio Grande do Sul were greatly hindered, jailed, lied about in the newspapers, and their literature illegally seized again and again. Lately, however, there have been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">changes in personnel</span><span class="font5"> of those in authority after these matters were called to the attention of the Federal heads of departments, personally and by letters which were published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolagao,</span><span class="font5"> and now our pioneers, with one exception, are free and active again, with two new ones added to their little band of fighters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number<sup>-</sup> of bound books placed was considerably in excess of last year; booklets, not so many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The magazine work has taken a good start, first in Sao Salvador, then in Sao Paulo, and now in Rio de Janeiro the publishers are doing a fine witness work with the magazines on Sunday afternoons, the time when almost the entire Brazilian population is out for a stroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Subscriptions, individual magazines and back-calls passed last year’s total; more hours in the field have been reported.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the help of a brother in the Rio de Janeiro company, we translated the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> It was a precious service, greatly appreciated by those who had to do with the work on that sweet little volume. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn,</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Children&quot; Study Questions,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last!</span><span class="font5"> were also translated into Portuguese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our two magazines continue to be published monthly. Many difficulties were encountered in bringing the press to Rio de Janeiro and in installing it after it was here, with all the necessary permits, etc. On December 24, 1941, after nearly a year’s silence, our little machine began to hum, printing the December issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolasao.</span><span class="font5"> In the meantime, since the March, 1941, issue of both magazines, we had been printing outside. We have succeeded, during the year, in registering both publications with the DIP (Department of Press and Propaganda), without which registration no magazine or newspaper can be published in Brazil. We are printing 1,200 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia (The Watchtower)</span><span class="font5"> and 1,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolasao</span><span class="font5"> each issue. The October issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia</span><span class="font5"> carries the two speeches “Peace—Can It Last?” and “Fighters for the New World”. 5,000 copies were printed for release at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the Conference of Chancellors held in Rio de Janeiro on January 15, 1942, occasion was taken to call to the attention of this body the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil, especially the lawlessness in Rio Grande do Sul. Letters were presented to the president of the Republic, the minister of foreign relations, the representative from the United States and the American ambassador, as well as to the chief of police of Rio de Janeiro, setting out the facts, which correspondence was published in the March and April issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolaqao</span><span class="font5"> and widely distributed. This drew fire from the enemy’s agents. The editor of the two magazines and the Branch servant, whose name was signed to the published correspondence, were called for questioning by the DOPS (Department of Political and Social Order). The findings of the investigation have not been made known to us, but we were informed that the Department was satisfied that our work is in no sense political.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign was entered into with more enthusiasm this year than ever before, and the result was an increase in subscriptions over last year’s report. 301 were taken during the campaign, 515 during the year, to compare with 269 for the entire year previous. In comparing these small figures with those of other lands, it is necessary to bear in mind the high percentage of illiteracy, 75.5 percent according to a table recently published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> the second highest of all countries whose statistics were listed. It requires much time to translate, set in type by hand and print on our small press two monthly magazines for only a few hundred subscribers, but the letters of appreciation from the hungry souls that are being fed at the Lord’s gracious hand by means of these magazines repay a hundredfold the effort and cost. It is hoped that with the magazine work now taking on an impetus, the number of subscribers will increase materially. We are mailing a good percentage, especially of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia,</span><span class="font5"> to subscribers in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch family of eight persons aimed at 100 subscriptions for the period and had the great joy of passing our goal, taking 104 subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foreign literature shipped out in April for the month of May indicated that the “Aiding the Refugees” campaign would be one of the grandest ever entered into, which, in fact, it proved to be, one-third of our good big stock of foreign literature moving out into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been customary for several years to hold a convention at the Memorial season. This has been a great blessing and refreshing for all who attended, especially the pioneers who are working in isolated parts with few opportunities to gather with their brethren. The Lord’s direction pointed to Sao Paulo as the convention city for this year and a blessed assembly was held there March 31-April 3. The attendance reached 179, nearly the double of last year, and there was the sweetest spirit of joyful co-operation ever experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses held on the earth during the three days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, September 18,19 and 20,1942, was the most remarkable gathering of any people in any age since the human race has been on the earth. Some day Jehovah will reveal to his people the real significance of that important assembly; now we see only in part, and marvel at our heavenly Father’s boundless love, wisdom and power in arranging and successfully executing this great gathering of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ever since the receipt of Brother Knorr’s letter of March 7 announcing the convention, we waited before the Lord to know if we, too, so few and so far away, under conditions of such uncertainty, would by any means be favored of the Most High with part in that Assembly. Some of us had been at Cedar Point in 1922, never to forget that assembly of God’s people that has had its effect of encouragement and strengthening to the faithful from that day to this. We had tasted the goodness of Jehovah at many of the notable conventions since that day and we just longed for our brethren here in Brazil to have the thrilling and joyful experience of actually being present at this great Theocratic Assembly. We didn’t know how on this earth that thing could be accomplished, but he knew and he performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There could be no convocation of the Lord’s people such as this one without a strenuous effort on the part of the adversary to interfere, and so there were some disappointments. Brethren from the north of Brazil made a great effort to attend. Some bought their tickets, only to find that water travel, their only means of transportation, was prohibited on account of submarine activity along the Brazilian coast. Others even started by land route, but, finding the way too uncertain and the necessary transportation lacking, were forced to turn back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On September 12, the brethren at the Branch office had finished the printing of 5,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia</span><span class="font5"> for October and were preparing, at an easier pace, to leave the house in good order and start travel on Tuesday in ample time for service in Sao Paulo, when Brother Knorr’s cable was received authorizing the printing here of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace— Can It Last?</span><span class="font5"> The Branch servant called the office force together and said to them: “We have permission to print the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace</span><span class="font5"> booklet. You boys have been working hard and I cannot ask you to undertake anything more before the convention. Shall we attempt to print any now or shall we print them after we come back?” Without a minute’s hesitation came the answer, “Sure, we’ll print them for the convention,” and by Tuesday night 2,000 were printed, packed and waiting to be shipped. On Wednesday night our dispatcher telephoned that, on account of the gasoline shortage, it would be impossible to pick up our shipment. Hurriedly the remaining members of the household held a conference and decided to carry the booklets in their suitcases as baggage; so they arrived safe and sound, but several cartons with other supplies, including songbooks and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font5">No. 11, were delayed and did not reach us in time to use them for the Assembly. We had stenciled song-slips made, which served very well. A sample of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> was put on the bulletin board, after its release on Saturday night, where the brethren had an opportunity to read it, and announcement was made that they would be supplied in the near future. These hindrances and inconveniences only served to heighten the joy of this New World Theocratic Assembly. What a world, this New World! and what a Theocrat to serve! May we never for one instant waver in our devotion, adoration and homage to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A letter received from one of the brethren in the north, a seasoned veteran, who had started out and had to turn back, says: “I pray to God that you are all keeping well, and may His rich blessing and spirit be your lot. We are determined to go on face to face, shoulder to shoulder with you until He has determined that it is enough. Although sad of heart that I could not be with you all at the convention, one thing remains clearly before me: that the Lord has been preparing his children for years to be able to face any problem or eventuality whether together or alone, for our vision is a oneness complete; so, instead of crying over ‘spilt milk’, we carry on with what He has entrusted in our hands and leave the rest to Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This account is closed with extracts translated from the report received from the servants of the convention in Sao Paulo. Under date of September 26, the convention servant writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Eighteenth day, morning session: In spite of the bad weather, 42 Theocratic publishers presented themselves and completed the first campaign, all faces shining with happiness. The afternoon term was completely interrupted by heavy downpours of rain, but the Theocratic publishers marched to the Conference Hall, where with great joy they awaited the manifestation of the instructions of The Theocracy. [Promptly] at 7: 30 [5: 30 in Cleveland] the Assembly was opened with songs of praise to Jehovah; at 8 o’clock began the lecture ‘The Only Light’. At 9 o’clock the lecture ‘Presenting the Sword of the Spirit’ was given, and during this lecture there was presented to the publishers a new Bible, edited by the Watchtower Society, as being a great help to the publishers and pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“19th day: 83 publishers presented themselves for field service at 8 a.m., and at two o’clock groups of publishers went out in the streets of the city with placards announcing the lecture ‘Peace—Can It Last?’ and distributing handbills. At six o’clock the lecture ‘Fighters for the New World’ was given, and at this lecture there were presented the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> the first in English and the second in Portuguese. The publishers and all those attending vibrated with enthusiasm giving thanks to the Most High for having presented more swords to fight the enemies of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“20th day: Beginning at eight o’clock with songs and prayer, the daily text was read from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> the program for the day and instructions regarding baptism, and immediately afterwards everybody assembled in front of the building wearing placards, to take two pictures. After the pictures the candidates for The Theocracy went to the place of baptism, symbolizing their consecration. The publishers went to the field to present the message of The Theocracy to the people of good-will. At one o’clock the publishers returned to the Hall to go out with placards and handbills to the streets and parks of the city which are most frequented. After finishing the distribution of the handbills which still remained, they returned to the Hall. At 2: 45 the meeting began with songs, after which at 3 o’clock ‘Defeat of Persecution’ was given, making clearly to appear that Jehovah protects his faithful people, and the utter defeat of the enemies of The Theocracy. Continually the hearts of the publishers were replete with joy, courage, devotion and strength to continue the battle up to the very gates of Armageddon by the Greater Jehu and complete victory to our King Christ Jesus. At 5: 30 began songs of praise to Jehovah ; on the faces of all present was noted much joy. At six o’clock the lecture ‘Peace—Can It Last?’ began, which was interrupted a number of times by applause from the audience. Much joy and love to Jehovah was manifested for this gracious provision, and at the close of the discourse a new booklet with the title of the discourse was presented. All who were present received gratis one [or three] copies of the booklet. At seven o’clock different brethren spoke matters of importance relating to experiences in the field, very pleasant to hear. At twenty minutes past seven the convention report was read, as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“At 7: 30 a talk on ‘The Final Gathering’ was given, and at eight o’clock the ‘Message from the President’ was read. At half-past eight a picture of the auditorium was taken. The convention closed with one only determination, that is, to continue the ‘strange work’ of Jehovah until his ‘strange act’ at the hands of the Greater Jehu breaks, the result of which will be the complete destruction of the enemy, thus perfecting the vindication of Jehovah’s name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Increasing difficulties and hardships of all kinds incident to war conditions have made it necessary to work longer and with more patience, but, being fully advised ahead of time, the Lord’s people have accepted the difficulties, pushing on in spite of them. Transportation has been a serious problem, what with a real gasoline shortage here. Until the rationing was adjusted, we could not even get gasoline to clean our type, and kerosene is not to be had, necessitating a laborious process of washing by hand with soap, which slowed down the printing. Our foreign brethren who are subjects of the Axis Powers find it extremely difficult to travel. Much time on the part of the Branch servant and his assistants has been spent with the authorities, doing what was possible to help these brethren continue with the work. Several were arrested by misinformed or prejudiced officials and afterwards released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in the Branch family wish me to express to you their love and determination to continue with you in the glorious fight for the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers for the Kingdom in the British Isles have been richly blessed by Jehovah during the past year. Their task has not been an easy one, but it has been one in which all representatives of The Theocracy had increased opportunities for faithful service under stress. Never before have so many persons suffered for righteousness’ sake in this country as during the past year. Our faithful brethren there have determined to stand for their lives, as have their brethren in Germany, Poland, France, Norway, and, in fact, all parts of the earth. Knowing the Devil is out to destroy the faithful, these ministers of the gospel press on with very little literature, but they do have the Bible and the Word of God in their mouths and thus carry on</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the work. There has been a splendid increase in the work as to the number of publishers, hours and back-calls. Well, over 900,000 more hours were put in the field work than in any previous year of witnessing. This valiant group of publishers made over 1,000,000 back-calls in 1942, an increase of 380,000 over 1941. Being publishers, putting in hours, and making back-calls are the only works they have to do, and these are the important things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of their faithful activity, more than 100 new companies have been organized in the past year. Their splendid work in back-calls and organizing studies shows how well the work has progressed in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Branch servant sent there by the Society five years ago was ordered back to the United States by the British government. The government had given the Branch servant the credit for the great increase in the work, but little they know—and much less would believe—that Jehovah God through His Son Christ Jesus is directing the work in Britain as in all other parts of the world. It is God that giveth the increase. While the Lord blessed that Branch servant richly and his devotion to the Lord is commendable, the good work by the faithful servants of the Lord in Britain has not stopped, but they arc going ahead with the new servant who has been appointed by the Society. Our brethren in Britain are of one mind and they will continue as fighters for the New World, following the Greater Jephthah, not any men. They fully appreciate the battle is not man’s, but God’s, and they are anxious to work according to organization instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blessings of the New World Theocratic Assembly were greatly enjoyed by those associated with the Kingdom work in Britain, and now they are able to distribute some of the recent publications, because of local printing being done. While the quantities furnished are small, due to restrictions on paper, the literature they obtain is placed with the people of good-will for personal study. Studies with the lovers of righteousness and people of good-will are the important thing now in this land, and excellent progress is being made. The present Branch servant sends this interesting report, and it shows how the work continues to increase to the Lord’s glory:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is with deep gratitude to Jehovah that the report for the British field is submitted herein. The past year has been an eventful one, and, looking back over the year, we give thanks to Jehovah our God for the abundant blessings received. The “strange work” has been pushed forward during the year in face of many obstacles. The wartime conditions in this land have placed limitations on all avenues of service, and these have had to be overcome. With the intensifying of the war effort, the man power and materials of the nation have been diverted into these channels. The great totalitarian monster, out for world domination, has forced all nations to institute control over practically everybody and everything. Under such conditions the work of The Theocracy has gone forward steadily. Only the spirit of the Lord has enabled his people to perform the record of service such as this report gives. Those who “know their God” have done “exploits” in His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Spiritual Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the outset we wish to put on record our thankfulness to the great Giver of all good gifts for the spiritual food that he has so graciously provided us with. The constant receipt of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> with all its marvelous unfolding of prophecy, has reached us regularly. This “food convenient” has been a strength to the Lord’s people to meet the increasing opposition of the enemy. The regular weekly study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> throughout the year in the study groups has undoubtedly served to keep the minds of his people, as well as others associated with them, fully alert to the Lord’s requirements. With the passing of our dear Brother Rutherford from the earthly scene of activity, we realized afresh our entire reliance upon Jehovah for the direction and guidance we so much need. Our hearts were made glad inasmuch as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> continued to come to us with the cleai<sup>-</sup> and strong lead and the Lord’s manifest blessing on what was written therein. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> of recent date have particularly thrilled our hearts to determined loyalty and faithfulness in our service to the great Theocrat. We would certainly feel it keenly were we without this precious provision of the Lord. The three-month </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign (February to April) brought into the London office 25,150 new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions. This shows an increase over the four-month campaign of last year of 3,473 subscriptions. The total distribution of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> throughout the year was 1,247,324. This also shows a marked increase over 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been a large increase in the vital features of the field-service report; these being particularly the publishers, hours, and back-calls. The limitation put upon us by reason of the shortage of literature opened the way under the Lord’s direction for the home Bible study campaign. This has been pushed forward throughout the year, and the report must be considered in the light of this united effort. God’s Word, the Bible, has had free course in this land, and, were it not for the blinding influence of religion, the many people of good-will would know the course to take. It has long been felt that if only ways and means could be adopted to reach the people for Bible study, then surely many would avail themselves of the enlightenment the Lord has provided by his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year ago, we received instructions from the Brooklyn office to organize the new method of work. Arrangements were made for conducting thousands of home Bible studies with the people. The British field was reorganized and the full-time workers were spread out into the more isolated districts, each being assigned a specific territory to be thoroughly combed and cared for, the object being to organize home Bible studies throughout the area. The company publishers have likewise concentrated on this phase of the work. As a result many new study groups have been established. This work has gone on apace and has proved a very effective means of instructing many as foretold in Daniel’s prophecy. There have been established 102 new companies during the year. This unselfish service has appealed to many honest-hearted people and they have responded to this invitation to study God’s Word in their homes. The great “howl” set up by the false shepherds during the year testifies to the effectiveness of the work done. The work has called for much patient effort. Oftentimes return calls are booked, only to find, when the return visit is made, that the person is out and seemingly had no intention of keeping the appointment. The faithful workers find that the “sheep” must be ‘hunted’. They must be searched out “from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks”. Those who appreciate their privilege will push on with this work in face of all obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point we would like to express our appreciation of the marvelous help the model study and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study questions are in carrying forward this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a shadow of doubt the past fiscal year has been the most perilous and difficult ever experienced by the brethren in the British field. Open violence and persecution have increased measurably, but so have the zeal and determination of the Lord’s servants. The effect has been that of stirring up the brethren to greater activity and ever-increasing regularity in Theocratic service. The record of the publishers </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> the field shines forth the faithfulness of the brethren and the rich blessings of the Most High. As a result of the great Bible study campaign mentioned above, hundreds of “other sheep” have taken their stand for the Kingdom. The unceasing working example set for these new ones by the older publishers has been a real stimulus and blessing, and the “other sheep” who are now taking their stand do so with the full appreciation of what is required of them and they are of the same mind as the oldej- publishers, fully determined to fight for the New World until victory at Armageddon, regardless of persecution and opposition. These new servants for The Theocracy are real fighters—not slothful, indifferent, or seeking adventure—and they come forth in the midst of great tribulation with the knowledge of the perils of being Theocratic publishers, thankful to the Lord Jehovah for the privilege of sharing in the Kingdom witness and for the opportunity of suffering for righteousness’ sake for the honor of Jehovah’s name; and this fearless attitude of these beloved companions is an inspiration to their more experienced brethren. All are rejoicing together in their Theocratic work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the British Isles the brethren have been eager to do everything they can to advance the work as the Society directs and they firmly grasped the work of increased back-calls and studies, as the report well shows. This had a good effect upon the time spent in the field and nearly one million additional hours were spent in the field. Surely the brethren are redeeming the time in these evil days. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign was a real blessing to the British publishers, for though they had little or no literature with which to work they could obtain subscriptions. Not allowing any advantage to slip through their working fingers they put forth extra efforts and 7,382 more subscriptions were obtained during the year than even last year’s mighty peak. The rationing of paper has limited the amount of literature that could be printed and distributed, but this decrease in literature placed is no means of discouragement or any indication of failure on the part of the brethren. Those things which can be controlled by the publishers— hours in the service, back-calls, and being a publisher— have all increased during the year, proving that when Christians sincerely agree to do Jehovah’s will they permit nothing to deter them as long as they have life. Even if all printed material, including the Bible itself, were taken from them, the brethren in Britain have the determination to preach this gospel of the Kingdom until the end comes. It is very commendable to see the way the brethren have labored hard to overcome the many difficulties in bearing their own burden before the Lord. The record of work done has certainly entailed much sacrifice and this has been given un-stintingly to the praise of Jehovah’s name. It is an honor and joyous privilege to be able to work with such faithful ones in the Kingdom service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those in the front line of the battle are the full-time workers, and these too have labored “day and night” (modelstudy work entails much night work) in the service of The Theocracy. The highest number of full-time workers in the field for any one month being 1,488. The organizing of the full-time workers into “special publishers” and “general publishers” was completed during the year, and separate reports have been kept since. However, for the purpose of this report they are combined. The increase in hours for the fulltime workers is 549,610, there being 2,205,679, as against 1,655,861 for last year. The back-calls too show healthy increase, the total being 586,398, against 290,010 last year. Of the return calls 216,175 were model studies, the average attendance at these studies being 13,342. The sound attendance shows a grand figure of 992,018, or an increase of 214,903. This sound figure for the pioneers consists of phonograph attendance on the door-to-door work and at model studies, as very few of the pioneers possess transcription machines. This makes an effective personal witness in each case. The number of new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions taken by the full-time workers is 15,720, as against 10,982 for the previous year. The limitation of supplies of literature has resulted in a like decrease with these workers as with all, the total number of books being 116,233 and the booklets 1,102.204, or a total of 1,218,437, while in 1941 the figure was 3,262,176.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has had to provide financial assistance to the sum of over £14,000 for the pioneers throughout the year, and the Lord has graciously made this possible by the willing assistance rendered by others. Only as this has been forthcoming has the great model-study campaign been possible with the pioneers. We give thanks to Jehovah for his gracious provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New World Theocratic Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was an event which all looked forward to with anticipation. The happy recollections of the Leicester convention of last year filled the minds of the brethren with a keen desire to attend another Theocratic Assembly. For the British field, there were ten centers chosen. These were Manchester, London, Birmingham, Bristol, Newcastle, Nottingham, Swansea, Gravesend, Glasgow, and Belfast. Manchester was the key city and it was expected that there would be about 4,500 present. Only two days before the assembly was due to begin we received word that the assemblies at Manchester and Nottingham were banned by the government, the plea put forward being that they were likely to cause serious public disorder. This ban was placed upon two of the assemblies but at all other points they were allowed to go forward without any interference. This interference with freedom of worship and assembly of Christians in Britain is a new experience and has called forth much comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">24th September, 1942 Rt. Hon. Herbert Morrison, M.P., His Majesty’s Secretary of State, Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ref: G.2.Div. 491,390/101 Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Convention meetings banned Manchester &amp;&nbsp;Nottingham, —September 18, 19 &amp;&nbsp;20, 1942—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The orders from your office, copies of which were sent to us by letters dated September 15 and 18 were effectively carried out by the police in both cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can be no question of your authority to issue such an order to ban meetings from being held where there may be a threatened disturbance of the peace of His Majesty’s subjects. But there are questions raised by this order which surely cannot be answered by a statement of the powers given to the Secretary of State for the preservation of the peace. The liberty of meeting for worship of Almighty God is involved in the ban.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The meetings in Manchester and Nottingham were only two of ten assemblies which were arranged for the dates mentioned. For all the assemblies a uniform programme was arranged. Of the eight sessions timed on each programme seven sessions were appointed for worship and fellowship as the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses gathered together for that purpose. The meetings were, of course, open to all who might care to attend. The Sunday afternoon session varied in this, that the public were invited to a part of the session, to listen to the reading of an address which was being delivered that day in Cleveland, Ohio, and transmitted by telephone to 52 cities in the United States. The whole series of meetings, with this part exception, were wholly for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Association has held such assemblies in Manchester on many occasions during the last 20 years, and not on any one of these have the police of the city had the least need to do more than perhaps conduct the numbers who have been desirous of attending the public meeting. This must be well known to many of the police authorities in the city. How it has come about that the Chief Constable there—and in Nottingham—should come to the conclusion that a peaceable people assembling for worship were a probable danger to the peace, and of such a character as to call upon you to ban the whole series of meetings to get the people out of the two cities is beyond any understanding. That the police only discovered their dangerous position at the last moment, and how they came to give such information as to cause you to need to send correcting orders, is a matter you only can deal with. That the ban was not necessary in the other eight places, including London, you will know. With the exception of a slight disturbance outside the Bristol assembly, caused by some of the Dominion visitors, there was, as usual, nothing to give the police any cause of care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instructions you gave were so late that it was impossible for us to stop our friends: we had no means of informing them that the assembly meetings could not be held, and consequently very much loss and inconvenience was put on some thousands of His Majesty’s subjects, who ought rather to have been able to call for the care of the State rather than to be treated as they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot but think that the banning of the meetings upon the information given to you by the local police of Manchester and Nottingham would be personally distasteful; but we voice our protest that as H. M. Secretary of State you took such action as to break into that which has been one of the glories of this land, the right of freedom to worship, and which at the time the meetings were banned Lord Halifax told America and the world that was one of the things for which the United Nations were fighting. What has been done is a new thing in the later history of Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses, on whose behalf we write, are a peaceable people, who never yet have given trouble to the State. Nor will they do so though while liberty lasts they will continue to claim the privilege of the State as they assemble for worship, sharing in this the rights which are, and of course, constantly given to all bodies of Christians as they meet for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am, Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours very respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For International Bible Students Association</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J. Hemery, Vice-president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much time was spent in trying to book halls in other places where the ban did not apply, but without avail, as just as quickly as the halls were arranged for they were canceled on us. In the case of Nottingham, the brethren worked hard to transfer the assembly elsewhere, and they were successful in that 1,000 assembled at a neighboring town and every session was carried through. Not so with Manchester. All surrounding towns were closed to us and the Assembly sessions had to be abandoned. However, the brethren who traveled to Manchester engaged in the door-to-door work and a fine witness to the people was given. Instead of the brethren being inside a hall attending the sessions, they were scattered throughout the city and there were very few streets that w’ere not occupied with witnesses on the doorsteps. Within the area where the hall was located and from which we were banned the territory was thoroughly covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil in his opposition to the Lord’s servants sometimes oversteps himself and a wider witness to Jehovah’s purposes is given thereby, although it may mean much inconvenience to the Lord’s people. We believe that it was so in this case, for the reference to the ban on our meetings was published in the press throughout the British Isles and a far wider witness given. At all other centers the assemblies were carried through without interference and an attendance of over 11,000 was recorded. If all the assemblies had been held according to schedule, there is every reason to believe that over 15,000 would have been in attendance. We give thanks to the Lord for this New World Theocratic Assembly and the thrilling messages we received. We are all resolved to follow the Greater Jephthah to final victory over all enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only by the grace of the Lord have we been able to meet the many problems that have confronted us during the year. As these have arisen the Lord has provided the way out. The work in the office has been full throughout the year. The letters received were 72,743; the outgoing mail being 75,255. The printing department has been kept busy. In addition to the many regular items, there have been the additional supplies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to print as well as some booklets to meet the heavy demand, the total pieces being 3,394,215. The total dispatches from the shipping department were 164,955 parcels. The factory department has been curtailed in its activities by reason of the shortage of materials. Gradually the supplies have been cut down, but we have been able to keep the running repairs on the phonographs and transcription machines. There have been made 2,530 magazine bags. In addition there has been the folding and stitching of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Supplies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The obtaining of literature to meet the requirements of so many active publishers has provided another problem, as no importation of literature is now possible from the Brooklyn office. This has necessitated the placing of orders for literature with outside printers in this country. We have had printed throughout the year the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> and the later booklets, including </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—-Can It Last?</span><span class="font5"> The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font5">for 1942 was also printed and distributed to the country. All these items we have obtained as it was made possible to us and as the paper allowance permitted. We miss very much the beautiful books and booklets we were able to import from the Brooklyn factory. Those that we have are much inferior in every way. Now we appreciate more fully the wonderful advantage of literature printed by consecrated servants of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family consists of 27 members. This number has varied a little throughout the year according as circumstances have demanded. Not all have been able to remain here all the time, but as far as this has been possible an endeavor has been made to keep the office in running order. We are thankful to the Lord that we have been able to keep the British field supplied with the vital things for the progress of the work. The field service report for the family shows a good increase. It follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We wish to put on record our protest at the action of the Home Office in removing from his appointed place of service our dear Brother Schroeder, who has served at the London office as Branch servant for the past five years. With no reason given for this action, he was ordered to leave the country and return to America. Refusing to comply with this order, he was deported by the Home Office. We submit the letter of appeal against this decision as part of this report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">May 21, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rt. Hon. Herbert Morrison, M.P., Secretary of State for the Home Dept., and Minister of Home Security,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Home Office, S.W.l.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this petition deals with a matter of principle involving a large number of Christians in the land, I trust that at least this letter will be brought to your attention personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On May 14 I received a letter from your Alien’s Department dated May 6 saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that he has given further consideration to the question of your stay in the United Kingdom, and has decided that he must require you to return to the United States of America forthwith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an American citizen I herewith make an appeal against this direction and ask for permission to remain at my post of Christian duty in Britain for the duration of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a fully ordained Christian minister of Jehovah’s witnesses, which ministry is recognized by the United States Government, I was sent to Britain in November 1937 to serve as a leading minister in association with Mr. J. Hemery, the British resident official of the Society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since 1937 I have been fully engaged in my Christian service in the United Kingdom fulfilling my covenant obligations with JEHOVAH God and His Son Christ Jesus, the rightful King of the Theocratic Kingdom. For over ten years I have devoted my whole life to the service of God and to the preaching of the Gospel as commanded in the Scriptures at Matthew 24:14. At no time have I participated in politics either in America, Britain or anywhere else. At all times I have endeavored to strictly adhere to all Home Office regulations governing resident aliens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I receive no personal or pecuniary gain in my service and thus have no private interest in seeking to continue residence in Britain. The principle involved is that of a spiritual appointment as a Christian minister. My appointment from God through the board of elders which assignment is recognized by my British brethren makes it incumbent upon me (Acts 5: 29) to ask you to extend my permission to continue residence in London. One of the four freedoms put forth so nobly by my president, Mr. Roosevelt, is that of freedom of worship. Britain also fights to preserve this sacred right. I ask that you honor me with that continued freedom in this land. Today throughout the world freedom of Christian worship stands in jeopardy of being trodden down by totalitarian suppression (Micah 5:5). All lovers of righteousness are fighting for the preservation of this God-granted right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Together with this letter you will find resolutions passed by 494 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These resolutions speak for themselves on behalf of thousands of Christians supporting my application for the continued right and freedom of worship as a Christian minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I also enclose a note of recommendation from my close friend and counsellor, Mr. J. Hemery, vice-president of the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am at a loss to understand the reason for your expulsion order, as I have not violated any regulations or received warning of anything amiss. I stand blameless before Almighty God and the nation as to any sinister implications, and you know I have been occupied solely in the discharging of my God-given commission as recorded at Isaiah 61:1-3. I am deeply conscious that the enforcement of your order would arouse much resentment and comment by a vast multitude of Jehovah’s witnesses and sympathizers in the United States both in private and official circles, to say nothing of the reaction amongst sincere Christians in the British Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am truly thankful for the many privileges and freedom of worship already enjoyed since 1937. I hold myself available for your personal interview if any further evidence or assurances arc required for my continued Christian ministry in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. D. Schroeder</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Resident American Christian Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Copy to the Honorable John G. Winant, United States Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also wish to express our appreciation of his faithful service here amongst us. We were sorry to see him go but fully realize that all these matters are in the care of the Lord and only by his permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The companies in the field operate 1,874 regular weekly studies. The conductors for these are appointed by the London office. The number of public meetings has decreased, there being 256 for the year. The total attendance at these meetings was 20,333. The number symbolizing their consecration by water immersion was 1,402. There were 43 personal assaults upon the brethren in the course of their Kingdom service. The number arrested and taken to police headquarters for questioning was 37. The total of court cases including tribunal hearing during the year was 852. The number of brothers serving sentences during the year was 433, the number of sisters 86, making a total of 519. The number of days spent in prison is 72,270. We have been able to provide regular weekly services at 38 prisons in order that these faithful servants of the Lord might have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">studies. These studies are greatly appreciated and are a source of strength to those in detention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In concluding this report we wish to assure you of our constant remembrance of all at headquarters. We know that the increasing pressure from the enemy makes it increasingly difficult to keep all the avenues of service open. We pray daily that the Lord will sustain you in caring for the work committed to your care. If the Lord wills that the way shall open for you to visit this country, Brother Knorr, in the days that lie ahead, we assure you that the many newly interested, as well as others who already have met you, will be very happy to welcome you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The days that lie ahead will, no doubt, be fraught with hard experiences, but we know that the Lord has brought his people to this hour in order that they might be a witness to his name. The enemy may apparently triumph, but not really so, because we have the assurance of final victory because our great Leader, Christ Jesus, will gain the victory. Because Jehovah has placed his great name upon us, he will for his great name’s sake protect and safeguard his faithful servants. We are determined to safeguard the Kingdom interests committed to our care, and to maintain our integrity against all encroachments of the enemy until final victory and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in this country continues, but under great difficulty. The report shows that 35 publishers, three of such being pioneers, have distributed 13,386 pieces of literature. They have more than doubled their back-call activity, increasing it from 1,500 back-calls last year to 3,690 this year. There are four companies organized and the publishers in this country have devoted 7,620 hours in the field service. The government in this British possession has banned the literature as they have in many others, but, while the work is banned, the Lord’s people hold to that precious right of worshiping God. The Branch servant’s report on conditions there follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have pleasure in submitting herewith our annual Report for 1942, and we would first of all express our gratitude to our heavenly Father for all his loving-kindness and tender mercies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effect of the ban on certain of our publications, imposed by the local government in January, 1941, has been very apparent during the period under review. Soon after our last report was dispatched word was received here from the secretary of state for the Colonies, in reply to our memorial on the subject, that he would not intervene in the matter, whereupon we again made representations to the local officials, but without success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present position is that we have been able to secure important licenses for some items, in respect of which we placed an order with headquarters some months ago. You have since advised us that you do not anticipate much difficulty in obtaining shipping space, and we hope to receive supplies very shortly, for we are now entirely out of stocks. No magazines will be admitted in bulk, and we have therefore had to request you to discontinue sending same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of these handicaps, you will observe that the 1942 placement of bound books is only 600 less than that of 1941. You will also notice an increase of 100 percent in our back-calls, and we are emphasizing this feature of the work, hoping that it will lead to new study classes’ being formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regular canvassing of the country districts has been maintained throughout the year, but the 3 pioneers engaged in this service have had to curtail their activities recently on account of the shortage of stocks. Although transportation difficulties increase, an effort is being made to keep in touch with interested parties, encouraging them to study the literature in their possession and to take their stand for truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two conventions were held during the year, one in Georgetown, and the other at Pouderoyen, West Bank Demerara. The average attendance at the various sessions was 100, and about 500 attended to hear the public lecture, “World Domination,” which was given on each occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were unable to secure a suitable hall for use on the 20th of September, but we put on a special canvass of Georgetown suburbs instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To our brethren harassed and persecuted in various countries we extend greeting, with the prayer that they may be kept faithful to the end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">More than two years ago the government of Canada, a supporter of the “Atlantic Charter” and fighting for the “four freedoms”, banned the Christian activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Recently some officials in that country saw the inconsistency of banning a Christian group and at the same time claiming they are fighting for freedom of worship. What will be the outcome no one knows. What we do know is that the Catholic Hierarchy, which exercises great influence in the Canadian government, do not want freedom of worship. They want totalitarian rule under their dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations that claim to be fighting for the principles of the Atlantic Charter will either have to prove themselves hypocrites or publicly confess that the principles set out in the “charter” are merely pretty-sounding words with no meaning to them. It is so evident in the reports from countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations that there is something working on the inside directly aimed at Jehovah’s witnesses. This “something” is Catholic Action, which the governments of the earth will not acknowledge, even though they be “Protestant” countries. Evidently they prefer to have the “old whore” ride the ‘new order’ they will ultimately establish, thus giving </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">religion,</span><span class="font6"> not </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity,</span><span class="font6"> a prominent place in the direction of the affairs of the world domination. (See Revelation 17.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Canadian government seized the Society’s property, banned the work, and declared it subversive, but Jehovah’s witnesses in that land have not slacked their hands, and, regardless of what pressure is brought to bear against them, we know they will not slack their hands but will move ahead ‘until the cities be wasted and the houses are without inhabitants’. Reports are received from time to time. In tabulating these reports as they come in from faithful brethren, the following is compiled. What is said is not based on hearsay, but is based on what our faithful brethren who have gone from place to place can report. Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada are fighting for the right to worship God in their own land the same as Jephthah fought the Ammonites and the same as Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the whole world are fighting the “Ammonites”, and they have come off victorious. They have held their ground thus far and all the fruitage of their labors has been offered unto the Lord, and you will note the report shows an excellent increase. In this country they are dependent on the Bible and knowledge of the Scriptures, and making back-calls; and because they are faithful much is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a reliable source in Canada comes a great variety of informative items which, when put together and viewed as a complete picture, give strong evidence that the Lord’s “strange work” in that land is by no means finished. There is yet much to do, and it is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said : “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” (Matt. 17: 20) It is true there has been a great barrier in our way, like unto a mountain, namely, the order in council, but, by Jehovah’s grace, and walking in the light of truth, directed by His Theocratic organization, the steps of Jehovah’s servants in this land have been guided aright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those Canadian servants of the Most High God have realized their personal responsibility toward preaching the gospel, therefore served in obedience to the commandments of the Most High. The testimony concerning the Kingdom has been raised up, and they greatly appreciate the privilege of offering this testimony in obedience to the command: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” The obedient and faithful have lifted up the standard for the Kingdom, that the people in this land may discern the primary issue confronting the nations, and may choose the side of life eternal. Moreover they are determined never to let that standard drop or permit any of the adversary’s agents to snatch it from their grasp. Jehovah’s spirit is with them, and they know that those of good-will, rallying to the standard, will assist in keeping it aloft, without compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average number of publishers engaged in the service the year prior to the ban (1939) was 4,269. For the year 1942 the average is 7,364. The highest total for any one month to date has been 9,000. The back-calls for 1939 totaled 132,000. For 1942 there were 217,500. We do not have the literature to distribute, but we are able to deliver the message of the Kingdom by word of mouth, and it is reported that more than 700,000 testimonies have been delivered in this manner. No doubt thousands more testimonies have been given, and there would be a greater increase in the number of publishers and back-calls if it were possible to obtain a full report of the publishers throughout the land. During this year the brethren devoted more than 907,000 hours to the field service, and 18,500 books and nearly half a million booklets were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the negligence, or lack of appreciation of some of the publishers, the forward movement is on, and Jehovah’s spirit is with them. The year has been one of unity, peace and harmony. They have all endeavored to appreciate their personal responsibility toward preaching the gospel, and the Lord’s servants have pushed on individually, each one accepting his or her own burden of responsibility with joy. Their enemies are doubtless angered to think that they are unable to hinder the servants of Jehovah from going about the land and from house to house comforting the mourning ones. The opposers now must realize that the servants of God do not require anything more than the Lord permits them to have in order to accomplish the work He has given them to do. Being content with such things as they have, they proceed with the proclamation of the gospel, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, even though the pressure of wartime conditions and restrictions is brought to bear upon them with increasing power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ban came in the summer of 1940, at which time the Theocratic activities were like a strong river current flowing forward, and suddenly the enemy brought to fruition the scheme which was intended to for ever stop the onrushing waters of truth, namely, the order in council, outlawing the servants of Jehovah, declaring us subversive and not fit for human society. This resulted in a temporary stoppage of the main body of the current, but the waters continued to swirl around the barrier and shortly they mounted over it and overflowed their banks. Now the truth is reaching persons not possible to reach before and much increase everywhere is seen. Persecution has been defeated to that extent, and the disciples of the Lord preach to all with whom they associate in addition to the regular house-to-house service. The stream of life-giving truth flows on, and the obstacle, though still there, is made to look like an insignificant rock in the bed of the river. Jehovah has done wonders for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Canada generally know a servant of Jehovah when one appears at the doors. No other people go from house to house so systematically, comforting those who mourn. No one else testifies to the name of the Most High as being Jehovah. No one else speaks of The Theocracy, or of Christ the King, or the end of Satan’s world, and therefore God’s people have by no means lost their identification. They can still sing, “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.”—Isa. 61:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Raids continue to be made on the homes of the brethren, but not so many arrests are made as a result. This is due to the fact that there is not much literature stored now, and the brethren refuse to answer the many questions fired at them by the officers of law conducting the search. In so many cases, the brethren were sent to jail as a result of information they had given at the time of the raid, and not because of what was found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any action brought against the publishers, either in the courts or otherwise, has only resulted in many persons of good-will becoming anxious for their welfare, and thereby drawn closer towards appreciation of and harmony with God’s organization. These brethren of the younger age class who have thus far suffered imprisonment or other penalty, rather than break integrity, have been overjoyed to find that in no situation have they been altogether barred from having some share of publishing the gospel of the New World. No barrier can be successful until the Lord brings his work to an end. Though many are serving in prison they rejoice in the knowledge that they are maintaining their integrity under test, and thereby proving Satan to be a liar and God true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many young men are in prison because of refusal to compromise and break their covenant with the Almighty. All Christians will love such younger brethren for their calm confidence in Jehovah, and for their boldness. Though they are restrained they have witnessed a good confession, and we shall greatly rejoice when their deliverance comes; and then what a great shout will ascend 1 We can all serve, suffer and rejoice together, praying for the grand time of deliverance to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible feature in their testimony has been a great help. It serves as an introduction, gives the necessary talking points at the door, and opens the way easily for a return call, to be followed by a Bible study. Our brethren have come to realize its effectiveness, not only in defense, but also in offense. There is a continual demand for Bibles. We have confidence in Jehovah that he will provide them with this ‘sword of the spirit’ as long as there is work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year thousands of Bible studies have been held regularly. Gatherings upward of 500 have been successfully held, and the Lord, true to his promise, has ‘prepared a table before them in the presence of their enemies’. At no time have they missed any of the good food the Lord provides in lands where freedom of worship is yet possible. The issue of universal domination is clearly seen and appreciated, helping them to maintain integrity. They surely are taught of Jehovah, and daily give thanks for the rich food served to them by our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is known that between 11,000 and 12,000 brethren attended the Memorial, and about 1,700 partook. A very large number of newly interested persons have been baptized during the year. The majority of them were young men and women. These brethren are always eager for immediate service and do their best to make for the full-time ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Representations to the Select Committee of the House of Commons: As a result of the nation-wide clamor against the abuse of the Defence of Canada Regulations a select committee of the House of Commons was appointed to review and amend the Regulations. Also they were authorized to call for documents or persons in connection therewith. Request was made to appear before this committee on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses. An invitation was extended by the committee to Jehovah’s witnesses to be heard. That invitation was accepted, and a brief was prepared to answer the charges laid against the Lord’s people and their associated corporations. In 1940, on July 16, question had been raised in the House as to why Jehovah’s witnesses had been considered subversive. The minister of justice not being present in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">House, the prime minister read this statement by the minister, in explanation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The literature of Jehovah’s witnesses discloses, in effect, that man-made authority or law should not be recognized if it conflicts with Jehovah’s witnesses’ interpretation of the Bible. They refuse to salute the flag of any nation, or to heil any man, and they oppose war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The genera] effect of this literature is, amongst other things, to undermine the ordinary responsibility of citizens, particularly in time of war.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Brief (presented in the form of a 29-page booklet) dealt with this statement and presented the truth. Some of the points covered were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The religionists in Israel urged Jeremiah’s death. Religionists today have induced the Minister to decree the end of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jeremiah reminded the rulers that if they yielded to the persuasion of the religionists they would thereby bring innocent blood upon themselves and that city. Jehovah’s witnesses must point out to this government that it is with Him a fixed rule of action to repay suffering inflicted upon His witnesses as if done unto Himself (Matthew 25:40; Luke 18:7). And this government and nation will not escape it if it continues in its unrighteous course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jeremiah reminded the rulers that the message he delivered was from God. Today, the message Jehovah’s witnesses bear is likewise from Almighty God. As the Court could not escape responsibility before God for its decision in Jeremiah’s case, neither can this Committee escape a similar responsibility before God on behalf of Parliament and the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To allow the ban upon Jehovah’s witnesses to remain is to interfere with the prerogative of the Almighty God whose Word they bear, to interfere with His anointed and commissioned witnesses to speak as He directs, and to say to the Canadian people, ‘We are censors of what the Creator speaks to His creatures.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The issue is simple. The position of Jehovah’s witnesses has been set out at some length. Briefly it is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Almighty God through His Word has ‘called’ individuals to serve Him. These are followers of Jesus Christ and have been brought into His Kingdom. They are subject to the law of that Kingdom and are, therefore, in covenant with Him to do as He directs. Jehovah directs them to be His witnesses in the earth and to speak as He commands. No man can censor that message, because it is God’s. Failure to deliver it means death. Failure of the people to receive it affects their eternal welfare. For any man to say they shall not receive it, in the words of Jeremiah, brings their blood upon the head of him who suppresses it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Almighty says: I shall have witnesses; and they shall speak My Word to My creatures. The Minister, by his Order in Council, says: You shall not have witnesses in Canada; neither shall they deliver Your message to the Canadian people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is in the nation’s highest interest that Parliament reject the counsel of those religionists who seek to prohibit the Word of God going to the people; and to say (and we think this Committee should recommend it), ‘This work should not be suppressed. Jehovah’s witnesses speak in good faith; they seek the highest interests of the nation because they speak in the name of God.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the hearing in the House of Commons, the 15 members of the committee for five hours directed a barrage of questions of every conceivable phase of our work and publications. It was felt after the hearing that the committee had been fair throughout. Every facility was granted us to state our case frankly and fully. The committee realized that the Defence Regulations as construed and applied to a Christian organization could not help but make illegal the worship of Almighty God because they restrain Bible study, prayer and praise. They were therefore practically unanimous in recommending the removal of the ban against Jehovah’s witnesses and the associated organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the War Measures Act the minister of justice makes the final decision. The present minister, while a lawyer and former president of the Bar Association (the recognized guardian of justice in Canada), is also a member of the Roman Catholic Church. The decision will in all probability be given at the beginning of 1943. Knowing that their opposition comes from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Jehovah’s witnesses expect much opposition by that organization to the lifting of the ban on them. The prime minister has been reminded that to permit the ban against Jehovah’s witnesses to remain is to violate his, and the nation’s, covenant given in the 26-Nation Agreement that Canada will guarantee freedom to worship Almighty God to all its citizens. So far he has failed to carry out his covenant in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time the government (minister of justice) is deciding the question regarding the lifting of the ban on Jehovah’s witnesses there is much agitation in the country to the end that the ban on the Communist Party might be removed. This organization had representations before the Parliamentary Committee at the same time as Jehovah’s witnesses. In their case the committee recommended the ban’s being lifted, but only by a slight majority vote. Prominent citizens of Canada have now taken up the cudgels on the Communists’ behalf and are holding large meetings to cause public opinion to appeal to the Government to lift the ban.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is a paradox! These same citizens, before the ban on the Communist Party, were their avowed enemies, yet now they clamor for their release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never a word is uttered by these prominent citizens for the release of Jehovah’s servants, who are the real friends of humankind, who seek to do good and do no harm to any, but are wholly devoted to the cause of righteousness. It reminds us forcibly of the experience of our Master at the time of His trial before Pilate, recorded at Luke 23. Though he was found innocent of wrong-doing, yet the multitude cried out, “Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas (who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison).” (Verses 18 and 19) The same spirit is active today in this country. The multitude, urged on by the leaders of the people, would prefer any organization be freed rather than Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses are comforted in the knowledge that the experiences through which they are passing are those spoken of by the Lord Jesus: “I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” (John 17 :14,15) They gladly bear reproach and count it an honor to be in the same circumstances as all of God’s servants have been in through the many centuries, knowing well that “if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New World Theocratic Convention: To breathe what was to the Canadian brethren pure air at this great convention gave to all just what they were needing. To leave the battlefront for a while and assemble with other fighters for the New World was a great time of refreshment and has energized them for the further activity. Now that they have returned to their place around the camp in that northern country they are fully determined to serve the Great Theocrat and His King come what may. They rejoiced greatly to reside for a few days in a place where there was an abundance of literature and liberty to preach the gospel, also to fellowship with those who have the same hope for the New World and who are fighting for it. Now they have a clearer vision of The Theocracy’s movements and how to be “fighters for the New World” at the present time. The “Go ahead” signal appeared clearly, and it is a source of great comfort to have the sword of the spirit provided by the citizens of the New World, so that they may participate in the fight and make advancement according to the Theocratic purpose. They give thanks to Almighty God for the Theocratic Organization Instructions, which become operative in every land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has placed in their mouths a marvelous and aweinspiring message to be delivered now to the people, pointing all of good-will to the New World. Opportunities are still with them in that country; and despite the persecution which will be brought against them and the many obstacles which will be placed in their way by Satan and his organization, yet, by Jehovah’s grace, these shall be surmounted and the witnesses will continue trusting in Jehovah, who is their strength and song, maintaining their integrity and so be “blameless in the day of our Lord”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Practically all of Europe lias come under the domination of the Nazi-Fascist totalitarian rule. Freedom has been taken away from the people. Those who have loved liberty, truth and righteousness may not express this love or they will be trodden under foot. The military machine directed by the harsh dictators is out to crush the people and regiment everyone. They have broken up families, moved them from one country to another. They are, as it were, in a prison surrounded by water, with no way of escape. Conditions existing in these nations could be brought about only by demonized rulers. It could not be of God, the Creator of the earth; for it is all wickedness. The Devil has tried to crush and break the heart of every creature. He has tried to bring into subjection the will of every man and woman. He has tried to train every child in the teachings of the totalitarian state and thus remove all love of liberty. In this he has failed. The Lord’s people will never be crushed. Jehovah has always had His witnesses. The truth will surmount all hatred, persecution, totalitarian rule and oppression. Because the faithful witnesses have stood hy the Lord and His Kingdom they have been tortured and killed, thrown into concentration camps, and their property destroyed. This has happened not only to the Lord’s servants, but to many others who love righteousness. The Devil is out to rule or ruin, and in this dark continent he is trying to remove the truth and the teachings of the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite three years of war and terror, reports trickle through that those who have entered a covenant to do the Lord’s will stand firm, not without hardship, for their burdens are heavy, hut they bear them as good soldiers. Their lives stand as shining lights to people of good-will who do not have the heart or the courage to stand as they do, because they have not learned the truth. Some day they may. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are sought out by the Gestapo and isolated so that they cannot preach God’s kingdom which will bring about the downfall of the Hitlerized Europe. This wicked reign of the Devil by his demons will come to the final end, and we believe that by some means Jehovah God in his infinite wisdom and mercy will preserve the lovers of righteousness for their good works and faith and they will be brought through Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many probably are going through trials equal to those of Job, and undoubtedly the Devil is considering these servants and has now learned that, no matter how great the torture, the isolation or despicable cruelty, he cannot break their spirit or integrity toward their Creator. It is a joy to be associated with such faithful servants of the Most High; for they are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reports from Central Europe are meager, but the brethren will rejoice to know that God’s kingdom has begun and these representatives of the Kingdom are doing what they can to hold high the standard of that kingdom. A report from Central Europe (Switzerland, where the work still goes on somewhat hindered, and which country tries to keep in communication with the representatives of the Lord in these downtrodden countries) gives the following information:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The condition of the work of proclamation in the countries which formerly as a whole were designated as Central Europe, viz., Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Poland, Rumania, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia, has not improved since our last year’s report, but rather, as was to be expected, has become worse. The prophecy in Isaiah 60: 2, “For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people,” surely finds its first application in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A complete eight months’ report is at hand only for Switzerland, Hungary and France, the figures for the latter country being very small. As regards the other countries, it has not been possible to get information each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one of the last issues of the Brooklyn </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> relating to the persecutions and the dispersion of the early Christians, the following is said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah caused advantages to come out of the persecution, in that his general publishers were dispersed, whereby in many new places more and more study groups sprang up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This fact is confirmed in a special way by the brief Hol-landish report. Apart from France, Germany and Italy, the Berne office had no personal connection with the brethren in any one of the countries mentioned above. Communication by letter was also quite sparse, so that we are very insufficiently informed as to the condition of the work. We hope, however, that by the time the annual report is to be compiled we shall be able to give more comprehensive news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A sister from this country visiting her daughter in Switzerland brought us the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The brethren in our country cannot possibly meet together, because our companions of faith are constantly watched, and from time to time the Gestapo (German Secret State Police) carries out domiciliary visits. Some may keep their Bible, but if a book of the Society is found, that may in certain circumstances even cost the life of its owner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Many brothers who, for reasons of faith and conscience, cannot do everything that is required of them, have been shot; many, too, have been killed in the camps. One brother who had been working for a considerable time at the Vienna office of the Society, was visiting some brethren, where he had to settle a few things, when they were surprised by the Gestapo. All of them were arrested and got prison sentences up to two years. At a further hearing the family whom the brother had been visiting were sentenced to death. The brother, however, claimed the whole responsibility for himself, and so he was shot, as it were, as a ransom.” Thus far the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another sister from Austria, who had been able to visit us here in Berne several times after her country had been joined to Germany, was arrested and is now in a women’s prison. She writes that she is well in the Lord and that she has many opportunities of witnessing; also that she is looking forward to an early deliverance and to seeing us again.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From private letters which, as mentioned in former communications, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Swiss pioneer writes to his mother, we learn that the brethren and friends in that country do not lack spiritual food. The brother wrote on several occasions that he had plenty of work, and although he could have returned to Switzerland, he preferred, for the work’s sake, to stay in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Bulgaria we are not able to report anything. Neither are there any reports on Czechoslovakia and Danzig.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Reports compiled show that there were 29 publishers in the field able to get their reports through to the Berne office, and that these publishers placed 1,621 pieces of literature. The report shows 467 hours in the field service, and that they made 502 back-calls. It should be kept in mind that these figures represent only a few months’ report of a few individuals. There is much more work being done by other publishers who are unable to correspond or get their reports through to the Berne office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is only by the Lord’s grace that our brethren in France are able to carry on. Now the entire country has been taken over by the Nazi rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are informed that it is now considerably more difficult to pass the line of demarcation between unoccupied and occupied France. That explains why we can get only little news regarding the progress of the work in Paris and northern France where most companies were in former years. We know, however, for a certainty that the number of brethren and Jonadabs in Paris has increased. A report received some time ago mentioned 400 for Paris. That report also said that the brethren in the city of Paris had to “fight through a very hard winter”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Free Zone of France we receive news quite regularly. Again this year a brother was able to visit us and, considering circumstances, his information was gratifying. The brother in question is fully occupied in the work in that he is constantly traveling and visiting companies as well as individual friends, helping them to get the spiritual food. We were able to send some copies of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font5">to German-speaking brethren who had been evacuated from the Alsace to unoccupied France. The number of readers of French </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> has considerably increased as compared with last year. The brother who visited us is convinced that there is still much work to be done for people of good-will in France.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From a report of a brother who has been traveling in Germany, but who, we regret, was not able to get in touch with many brethren, we gather that those with whom he could speak remain loyal, and firmly expect a speedy bursting of the fetters. The brother further stated that it seems that there is still a company of brethren in Germany firmly standing by the Society as the Lord’s institution to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He further told of a 60-year-old brother who, after having spent a long time in a concentration camp and having then become free by reason of an amnesty, immediately resumed his connection with those of like faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His other statements regarding conditions in Germany correspond to last year’s report sent to Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister whose husband spent nearly four years in a German prison, she having stayed in Switzerland during that time, recently had to return to Germany. She had hardly passed the border when she was arrested and taken to the prison of a larger city. The sister is of good courage and always finds words of comfort for her relatives. This sister has left most endearing memories with us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The report received covers only eight months. There is assurance that the brethren have been working for the entire year, but reports have not reached the president’s office. It is truly marvelous, and only because of the Lord’s direction and His rich blessing upon His people, that 471 publishers in the heart of Europe can continue on in the work. These brethren placed 4,407 pieces of literature, and put in 30,364 hours. This is an increase over 1941, as to time in the field. It brings much joy to our hearts to know that 3,752 back-calls were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to these very interesting figures showing that the brethren are standing firm and not slacking the hand is a report from the Berne office concerning Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surprisingly the brethren in Hungary can still do a considerable amount of work, which is shown by the number of hours, viz., 30,364.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Especially the brethren and Jonadabs in Transylvania, which formerly belonged to Rumania, seem to go on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time there was some dissension among the brethren in the two parts of the country, and it was rather difficult for us to ascertain the cause or the center of it. The reports we received were very contradictory. Yet we believe we have, by the Lord’s grace, made the proper choice as to the one now in charge of the work there, which seems to be confirmed also by a further report received a few days ago. The brethren and Jonadabs in both territories, i.e., in Transylvania and in Hungary proper, were willing to do something, but the Devil had succeeded in causing misunderstandings. There may have been selfish motives with some. The new Branch servant had a hard stand; he now writes, however, that he believes matters have been cleared up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no report from</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A brother had an opportunity of traveling in a certain part of this country and he learned that the brethren about whom he last reported to be banned on an island are not in fact subjected to harsh treatment and that even the brothers enjoy a certain liberty of movement in the villages of the island. In the case of a married couple, the brother, having been there for some time, was allowed to receive his wife on a visit and for the time of her stay a small apartment was placed at their disposal. However, the brethren who are there will not regain their freedom so soon, the sentences running up to 11 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister tries to maintain connection among the brethren as well as possible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>THE NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The report which follows show's that the brethren here are putting up a magnificent stand for the New World, and are continuing to proclaim the message concerning God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Memorial report for 1942 shows that 590 assembled for Memorial; this, of course, without the knowledge of the Nazis. Of these, 47 partook of the emblems, indicating that they are of the remnant. It brings joy to all the faithful followers of Christ Jesus to see the “Jephthah’s daughter” class taking their stand and devoting their time to the interests of the Kingdom no matter where they be, in countries overrun by totalitarian rule, such as the Netherlands, known to most people as Holland, or in countries where greater freedom is given them. The report shows that a considerable amount of literature has been distributed among the people of good-will during the past few years. The report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A letter from there reached us through a very circuitous route, and what it contains is extraordinarily comprehensive and disclosed to us a complete picture of the spiritual condition and the great zeal of Deborah and Jael. Here is what it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At last I received your letter dated ... It has strengthened not only me but also my friends. In the meantime I made the acquaintance of a musician—a violinist—who had already given me the news of Joseph’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">X thanks you for your greetings. Since October last year he has had to undergo five, if not more, very serious operations. He has much to bear, but his splendid spirit and strength have not left him. In his zeal he has even worked during his sickness, which was greatly to our benefit. Rahab’s medicine seems to have done him a lot of good; he is apparently better now. Mr. Sisera is so astonished at his work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that he offered him a higher position in his business. However, in his modesty he declined, stating that he was his permanent guest anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since May, 1940, from which time he has especially been busy for the new order, his business has delivered, all together, 602,259 pieces of our produce. When it is considered with what difficulties one has to contend with nowadays, it is a tremendous performance. Recently, however, we had to issue a warning that better precaution has to be taken, for unclean elements might become a trap for some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time ago we sent greetings to Joseph; we are now informed that we were not successful in this attempt. We heard that one of Joseph’s children is staying in Denmark and that our friends there are quite well. We too would be happy to accommodate one of his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Sisera has sold our plant. This followed America’s declaration of war. Eighty-two members of the staff have been sent to Germany and another 112 have been placed by Sisera in this country. Having seen the list, he has, considering the bad conditions, invited the other workers to follow their comrades. Three of our sons have died a heroic death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is really beautiful harmony in our family here. Only on one occasion had we to take strict measures. Some wouldn’t listen to their mother’s instruction, and so we have withdrawn from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently we had a lovely festival here in the south. It was in the evening of March 30. 590 friends were assembled, whereof 47 took a special place at the table. Work goes on in the firm conviction that the long-hoped-for peace will soon come.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In our last year’s report we mentioned that we were able to exchange correspondence rather regularly with a faithful person in Poland. This we were able to maintain. However, we have again received no actual report on the work done in that country. We just learned once that the “offspring are increasing” and that the “young ones” were a cause for much joy and the brethren were looking with full expectation into the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the last report received a few days ago there is less favorable news, namely, that the former Branch servant was “taken to hospital” again and that the sickness being this time of an obstinate character he would probably “have to go to a sanatorium for a thorough cure”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The supply of spiritual food has become meager. They wrote that since September last year they have received no periodicals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren here are doing everything they possibly can. In a few letters received from time to time we know that they have placed books during 1942. It was also gleaned, from information received, that 278 attended the Memorial service and 155 partook of the emblems. This shows that the brethren are not forsaking the assembling of themselves together, and that they are still able to do something in this dark country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This country is in the midst of nations at war, but still maintains its neutrality. With pressure brought to bear against them from every side, and particularly from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy within the country itself, the brethren there stand firm. Not only do they hold their ground that the Lord has given them thus far in the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom, but they have gained many new publishers for The Theocracy. In 1942 there has been an increase in publishers. The report shows that in eight months there were 1,358 witnesses for the Kingdom, putting in 109,789 hours. The report for the entire year, if it were at hand, would, we feel sure, be much greater than this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report concerning Switzerland, which follows, is very interesting. It shows the determined effort on the part of the brethren to stand firm, to magnify the Lord’s name and to preach this gospel of the Kingdom regardless of all costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That in the course of this fiscal year it would be made possible, apart from periodicals and booklets, to print and distribute a book, had not come to our minds when dispatching our last year’s report, especially in view of the growing difficulties in connection with the publishing work. Knowing that our opponents, which in Biblical figurative language we may recognize in “Egypt” and “Assyria”, have organized a campaign against us, we were rather inclined, from a mere human point of view, to think of an early termination of our activity. However, from the moment a copy of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> in the English language came into our possession, we recognized that it was manifestly the Lord’s will that we should without delay proceed with preparations for publishing this book also in this country. That was not an easy undertaking, because certain prescriptions of the military authorities had to be observed. But, stimulated by a cablegram from our dear Brother Rutherford in answer to an urgent question concerning censorship, we started work joyfully and with full confidence. And practically from the first day we clearly recognized the leading of the Lord. The books were completed exactly at the fixed time and they constituted the greatest surprise for the big General Convention in Zurich in the spring of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The activity followed the production of the literature, and so, during the eight months, September, 1941, to April, 1942, over 15,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> approximately 4,000 Bibles, 340,784 booklets, 193,496 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> and 130,350 leaflets were put into the hands of the people. This was done by 1,358 publishers, in 109,789 hours. Compared with last year’s result, this may be considered as a most pleasing advancement, yea, as it were, a gift from the Lord, for there are more books, more booklets, more hours in the field, and more publishers, not to forget the 4,887 newly won </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> readers, which figure also considerably exceeds that of last year, as shown by the tabulated report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brief explanation regarding the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> is necessary. As here in Switzerland we work with this book according to the lending system, it is not possible to have the brethren report the copies distributed. For this reason we note every month the copies forwarded from the office. This eight months’ report shows 15,519 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children. </span><span class="font5">The annual report will contain this figure plus the number of copies forwarded during the remaining months of the present fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the very often mountainous territory which they have to cover on foot, the pioneers have carried on courageously. Distances are often very long (the railway being very expensive, it cannot be used regularly), so that the actual working hours are essentially reduced by the many hours spent in going to and from the territory. The formation of study-groups makes nice progress, thanks to the labors of the pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Various Items of Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year seven regional service and two general conventions (one for the German-speaking and the other for the French-speaking brethren) were held. On these occasions, 1,877 publishers spent 3,874 hours in the service of proclamation during the mornings. 24,222 booklets and 2,650 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> copies were distributed. These assemblies were attended by a total of 5,200 brethren and Jonadabs. During this publishing work more than 1,100 addresses for back-calls were noted. 243 brethren were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 4: 8 and 9: “We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.” The present experiences of God’s people in Switzerland are just according to these words. Since the enemy stretched forth his hand to destroy us two years of trials and of raging battle have passed. But time and again his attempts failed. Why? So that the witness might be given in this country as never before. Our hearts are so full of gratitude towards Jehovah that we eannot fully express it. Putting our confidence in the Lord, we have learned to go on step by step, often not knowing if for the one or the other undertaking in the work of publication there would be either the means or sufficient time. But in each instance the Lord gave us a sign at the proper time by which we could recognize that we were to carry steadfastly on. So the Lord gave us the two things: the time and the means; and therefore we thank him because ‘he is good and his mercy en-dureth for ever’.—Ps. 136.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our last year’s report we mentioned that we had the prospect of giving a great witness in the biggest Swiss city, Zurich, in the House of Arts, the most beautiful building of this kind in Zurich. The Lord prospered this. The public lecture with lantern slides, in two parts, on the subject “World Peace Only Through The Theocracy”, drew about 2,500 visitors each evening. The attention was as seldom experienced. All ranks of society were represented in the audience, for, seeing it was the House of Arts, even people from the “upper ten” dared listen to a lecture by the “Bible Students”. Honest people expressed unanimous appreciation, but the adversaries were there too; these showed themselves and were sure of their success. They failed, or at least did not obtain the success they had hoped for. Because in the opinion of an official reporter our language had been too frank against the Hierarchy and totalitarian elements, and because we showed a few pictures to the point, which were, however, accompanied by purely Biblical explanations, the individual cantons of Switzerland were given authority to watch our assemblies, both public and private, if they so desired. However, the lower officials made but little use of such liberty, manifestly because competent authorities know us as an unpolitical movement whose adherents believe in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hierarchy continued its campaign of slander through its hired accomplices, especially by means of newspaper articles. Thus in one article Jehovah’s witnesses were asked questions, which we naturally answered, first in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">under the title “Catholics Ask Jehovah’s witnesses”. Then this answer was printed in leaflet form, a copy of which was sent to all the newspapers and generally distributed to the extent of 100,000 copies. It was surely interesting that the censor released this leaflet. And now began the echo from Catholic circles. In one district of a Catholic canton it was demanded that the leaflet be confiscated, which was promptly done, a few days before the General Convention, in the rooms of Bethel. However, the officials found but a small quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there followed the first hearing in court, whereupon the confiscation was canceled and the leaflets returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ever oftener the question was flung out in the Catholic press: “How long will Jehovah’s witnesses be allowed to continue their practices?” The interesting fact about it all was that those Catholic newspapers made themselves ridiculous in literally quoting their own questions, causing the people to feel offended about it and to call on the police for help. So the angry one falls into his own net!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, in an atmosphere loaded more and more with tension, we proceeded, looking daily up to the Lord, with the preparations for the greatest General Convention ever held in Switzerland by exclusively Swiss brethren and Jonadabs. There was practically no obstacle encountered in our speedy preparations; which was another clear indication that the Lord held blessings in store for Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What especially energized the colaborers of the Berne factory for the many preparatory jobs was the successfully progressing preparation of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> Here happened a real miracle, in this, that the day came when the manuscript which, in present circumstances, and with the agreement of Brother Rutherford, we had to submit to military censorship, was returned to us </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">without the least deletion, </span><span class="font5">but with the remark, “Released for publication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days before the opening of the General Convention the work was completed and we were as children awaiting in suppressed excitement the moment for the great event to arrive. And see, nearly 2,000 brethren arrived already on the first day, and by Sunday the number had speedily increased to approximately 3,000! Surprise followed upon surprise:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A 32-page report in a special issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> concerning the general conventions in St. Louis and in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief discourse, on Daniel—the subject matter therefor having miraculously reached us only a few days before the General Convention. The expose was received with genuine enthusiasm, and it was a most stirring and edifying hour for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saturday morning, service from house to house (each conventioner had received his assignment of territory with his card of identity, publishers and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> readers alike. 1,200 witnesses of the Most High participated in this blessed service and put 22,000 booklets and 2,500 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> into the hands of the population of the city of Zurich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then on Sunday morning the release of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children. </span><span class="font5">This act was a most amazing surprise for this magnificent festive assembly gathered here in Zurich, and it was received with powerful and prolonged applause. Of the cloth bought in former years for the publishing of Brother Rutherford’s books we had a stock in nine colors sufficient for 30,000 copies of a bound book. This was now used for the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> Our artist was asked to prepare big placards in nine colors demonstrating the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> On the platform were placed nine tables, and, upon a sign being given and amidst the singing of a song, 18 brothers came marching on the platform, one with a placard and the other with an armful of copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> the color matching the placard. This procession called forth mighty applause and now the 406 children were allowed to go up on the platform and receive each a copy bound in their favorite color. Before this a discourse had been addressed to the children as well as to the parents, based upon the statements in the book itself and on the article “Noah’s Day”. This “scene” was marvelous and there flowed many a tear of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we got the first news concerning your Theocratic general convention in Cleveland, we decided immediately to hold one ourselves. Seeing that the city authorities of Basle had always shown a friendly attitude toward us, we selected that city as the place for an assembly, and the authorities agreed that a convenient hall in the Fair buildings be placed at our disposal. There was no necessity for elaborate preparations, and no necessity to address to the companies a special appeal for participation; for the reaction upon a mere general communication was spontaneous and the participation was far beyond our expectations. From all parts of the country the brethren and their companions flowed together, and the picture that presented itself to us Sunday morning was a hall filled to capacity: a multitude quietly assembled in tense expectancy, with joyous yet earnest faces turned toward the magnificently decorated platform which gave the impression of the wide open country under a blue sky. Another solemn assembly, in these stormy times fraught with danger, as ever present here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord had provided rich and wonderful food:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consideration of the daily text; then a discourse on Micah 6th part, followed by a home Bible study in connection with the release of the question booklet for the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> (a copy of this booklet had been received just at the right moment, from London, and thus we were able to present it as a surprise to the brethren assembled in Basle) ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the afternoon a symposium—a presentation of interesting items taken from various reports published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> which we had eventually received from London, followed by a discourse on “Defeat of Persecution”, and in connection therewith the release of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font5"> which also came as a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To conclude, the reading of the main parts of the report in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> (a stray copy having exceptionally reached us) regarding the burial of Brother Rutherford; and as parting remarks, among other things, the following paragraph was quoted from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> November 1, 1922, that is, from the discourse Brother Rutherford gave at the time of the Cedar Point convention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Do you believe that the King of glory is present? . . . Do you believe that during this time he has conducted his work? Do you believe that he has had during this time a faithful and wise servant through whom he directed his work and the feeding of the household of faith? Do you believe that the Lord is now in his temple, judging the nations of earth? Do you believe that the King of glory has begun his reign ? Then back to the field, 0 ye sons of the Most High God! Gird on your armor! Be sober, be vigilant, be active, be brave. Be faithful and true witnesses for the Lord. Go forward in the fight until every vestige of Babylon lies desolate. Herald the message far and wide. The world must know that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords. This is the day of all days. Behold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore, advertise, advertise, advertise the King and his kingdom!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the questions were answered with a powerful “Ja”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the people of God of our country assembled in Basle, united with you in spirit, enjoyed a most blessed day. The assembly lasting but one day and the visitors coming only in the early forenoon, no provision had been made for field service. In addition, the management of the Fair buildings had made it a condition that there be no public “propaganda” of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saturday afternoon we had a meeting with the pioneers, and in the evening one with the company servants, from all over Switzerland.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant of what was formerly Yugoslavia can still continue his activity, although now under very restricted conditions. At certain intervals he sends us some figures. The situation seems generally to be very critical. We quote the following from a report which he sent us last fall:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ . . . This data is only from two companies which are still in touch with me. The number of workers has decreased tremendously, for a death sentence awaits those who do this work. But as you will see, some are still active, which is a genuine joy to me. You cannot possibly imagine what is going on here. The general view is that it is much worse than in G. Here the Hierarchy reveals its true face. Things are happening which are almost impossible to believe, and the official leaders of such so-called ‘punitive expeditions’ are members of the ‘black brigade’. Knowing all these things positively, and looking at my own person, I am made to feel the powerfully protecting hand of my Father, under which I am privileged to accomplish miracles with my family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A report of this year says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the meantime much has swept over us. The Dragon has become raging, but Jehovah’s mighty hand is over us, and, in spite of all, we rejoice at what we see happening around us. Not only that, but we go right at it more diligently; for that is the only thing that satisfies us. There is much work, and, there being only a few workers, we, the few, have to make the greatest efforts to do all there is to be done. Thus circumstances demand that we make the greatest possible number of back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In order to leave something with the people, I have begun to publish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> The first issue is at our disposal. As regards my family in Belgrade, everything is in the best of order; diligently and valiantly they carry on there. My property left in Belgrade is also in order, and the members of the family are making very good use of it. When I left there, there were, all together, seven upright ones, and now their number has increased to over thirty. I have great joy. Indeed it is greater than ever before, and my faith has grown stronger; I have cause for continual thanks to the Lord.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Under the Australasian report there is shown some activity in western China by pioneers that were sent out by the Australian office. These faithful pioneers worked along Burma Road all the way to Chungking and distributed all the literature they had, and finally flew from China to India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Branch at Shanghai corresponded with these brethren for a while, but early in the fiscal year all the communication from that Branch office ceased. In the early part of the year the reports compiled show that there were twelve publishers in Shanghai, eight of them pioneers, and these brethren in but two months’ time distributed 1,434 bound books and 5,891 booklets, and, in addition, 450 magazines. The Branch office there was publishing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> in Chinese and had an excellent mailing list, but evidently all of this was confiscated during the invasion by the Japs. The brethren were working hard and put in 2,175 hours and made 108 back-calls in two months’ time. In the last letter received from the Branch servant he states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in Shanghai are putting on more heat. The Theocratic publishers unitedly march out to the battle-front proclaiming God’s message to all walks of life. Interesting and thrilling are our field experiences which are reported at service meetings. Even Buddhist monks took our literature. The placements of literature now are breaking all records of the past. The Chinese people in this time of great stress take much literature. No doubt the Lord is causing a great witness to be given to the people, particularly the Chinese, in this land before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Along with the last report coming through from Shanghai their stock report showed approximately 1,600 bound books on hand and 11,000 booklets. These probably lasted them for a little while. We can feel sure that the Lord’s protecting hand is over our brethren there the same as in all other parts of the earth, even though nothing has been heard for ten months.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The past year has brought new problems to the brethren in Hawaii, but these problems were overcome by greater activity on the part of the brethren. There are publishers on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. A good witness has been given and people of good-will are seeking the truth. The servant’s report gives the details of the activity of 1942:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With grateful acknowledgment to Jehovah of the many provisions made that “this gospel of the kingdom” might be carried to the people of the Hawaiian Islands, report for the period from October, 1941, to September, 1942, is made. The total results of the house-to-house witness for the fiscal year are:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Bound books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,001</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48,711</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Total placed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,712</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,520</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">New subscriptions 695</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Individual magazines 5,955</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sound attendance 6,152</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Back-calls &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,295</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Average number pub’rs 46</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">That the rich blessing of the Lord was upon the year’s work is indicated by the fact that more than twice as many bound books, and 10,378 more booklets, were placed; and, further, that 4,767 more hours were devoted to witnessing than in the previous year; also that the number of magazine subscriptions was more than doubled, even though the average number of persons witnessing was 10 less than in the preceding year. Also, almost four times as many back-calls were made as previously; and twice as many persons of good-will toward Jehovah God and Uis King Christ Jesus took their stand for The Theocracy, and so indicated by water immersion and participation in the witness. During the year 631 meetings were reported, with a total attendance of 4,733, and many more were conducted about which no report is had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than one thousand Bibles in English and other languages were placed during the year. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> was a real gift from the Lord for use in honoring His name, and has had a wide circulation throughout the islands. A total of 12,909 copies were received since October 5, 1941, and at the end of the fiscal year only 1,456 were on hand. The increase in number of back-calls is due to the use of the study course and subsequent back-calls. In spite of war and attending difficulties in shipping, at no time during the year did the stock of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> run out except for a short period of a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Decrease in the number of publishers is due to having had 8 return to the mainland, and because many brethren formerly active are now required to work seven days a week. While the average number of publishers is 46, more than 75 different persons engaged in the house-to-house witness during the year in all the islands, ‘of all nations, and kindreds, and people and tongues,’ including some Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Puerto Rican, Portuguese-speaking and other Americans. Some of these publishers were worshiping Buddhist and Shinto idols only a few months ago, but now are rejoicing in a knowledge of Jehovah and His Theocracy, and are happily in His service showing others the way to life. There were 83 in attendance at the Memorial celebration, and 11 partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year a total of 15 different persons engaged in pioneer witnessing, for a total of 130 months’ time, but the average number for the year is 9. The pioneer witnesses are located at four different islands, and consequently have to forego meeting and fellowship with other brethren. The cost of living and food has always been high in the islands, and now, due to war conditions, it is higher than ever and pioneering requires real devotion and sacrifice on the part of the brethren. Not being endowed with much of this world’s goods, and the territory being very scattered, with roads that are hard on tires and springs, the maintenance and upkeep of their cars is a real problem, and one which eats into their time. Witnessing in mountainous, rocky areas with old cars means many tires to change, and broken springs to replace, the brethren report. Then, too, the care of Kingdom halls on three islands, and a pioneer home on a fourth, and with meetings to conduct, requires the time and attention of pioneers. For the use of such as headquarters and meetingplaces and for literature storage, we give many thanks to Jehovah, as without them the witness would not be possible. Gardens and chickens, also ducks, at each of these help to provide food for those brethren giving their full time in Jehovah’s service. Among three married couples pioneering there is a total of nine children, all quite young and of school age, and they require time and attention, also expense, although all participate in the witness as much as is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This letter from a pioneer is of interest: “The year of 1942 has been a very happy one for us at Kauai. This is so in spite of fuel rationing and black-out. Of course, it has been impossible to make as many calls upon the people this year as in the past, because of war-time restrictions, but almost everyone is really more interested in the Theocratic message than ever before. Before Pearl Harbor, many took literature, but the majority refused to believe that any serious trouble would reach Hawaii. That is all changed now, and often questions are asked about the immediate future, etc. When they are told that the Watch Tower publications will answer all their questions, they are glad to get them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As most of the brethren here are Filipinos, a test is placed upon them because of the situation in the Philippine Islands. They are a fiery and proud people, and there is a temptation to try to get revenge upon the Japanese because of the treatment accorded their friends and relatives at home. I am happy to say that every one of them has declared that they know there is only one hope for them, The Theocracy, and are very willing for the Lord to settle the whole matter once and for all. They only wish to have the privilege of making known these things to those who wish to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“These brethren are handicapped by a lack of understanding of the English language. However, their determination to learn makes it a great pleasure to meet with them, and I am confident they will continue to make progress, both in understanding and ability to serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News of the convention to be held September 18-20, at 53 different places including Honolulu, and with the key city being Cleveland, Ohio, was received joyfully, and preparations were begun. The brethren at Honolulu decided to invite all pioneers in the islands to attend the convention here. Only by plane is it possible to travel now between the islands; so it was necessary to aid the pioneers to come. The matter was presented in prayer to the Lord, and different brethren contributed to this special fund as they were able, with the result that all pioneers except two attended. These were unable to secure airplane reservations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention program as outlined for the mainland was followed, but, due to communication difficulty, it was not possible to receive the discourses from Cleveland direct, so copies of the main addresses were read and greatly appreciated. The sample copy of the new Bible published by the Watch Tower Society was eagerly examined after its introduction on Friday, and all publishers hopefully await receipt of a larger shipment. It is just what is needed for study purposes, as it has the marginal references and a concordance, and, besides, is so inexpensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The address “Fighters for the New World”, on Saturday, was keenly enjoyed, and the introduction of the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font5"> was heard of with enthusiasm. It was regretted that a copy did not reach here for the convention, but all witnesses hope for the privilege of reading it and of placing many copies in the hands of the people of the islands, informing them of Jehovah’s provision. The resolution following the talk was unanimously passed, and word to that effect sent by radio to the Society’s president at Cleveland, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday Kingdom Hall was filled for the public lecture, and 99 persons heard “Peace—Can It Last?” As a supply of the booklet on that subject was not had, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hope </span><span class="font5">booklet, which arrived just that week, was used, and 399 copies were placed at the close of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday morning 9 persons were immersed. During the convention 3 persons made application for pioneer service, and 3 others joined the ranks of the company publishers. It was our first convention in Honolulu, and all attending felt it had been arranged for and been blessed by the Lord. All the pioneers and some other brethren from outside islands were put up at Kingdom Hall during the convention; so the ‘family’ totaled 15 persons. It was the first time all of Jehovah’s witnesses in the islands had met and assembled together, participating together in the service, and it was indeed very inspiring and a cause for happiness, for which we give thanks to Jehovah. All returned to their respective islands with renewed courage, and determination to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thanking Jehovah for the privilege of service during the year past, and looking forward joyfully to another year with ever-increasing opportunities of honoring His name, and with much Christian love, I am with you . . .</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers for the Kingdom in this great land have found that here those who preach the gospel of the Kingdom are regarded as a peculiar people. There are in this land not many publishers, but the few there are looking after the interests of the Kingdom and trying to advance the work to the very best of their ability. Much opposition has shown itself during the year, and a goodly portion of it comes from the so-called “Christian” religionists. It is because of the truth that the Lord’s people are hated. They cannot find anything against Jehovah’s servants except the preaching of the gospel; therefore trumped-up charges are made that the work interferes with the war effort. The importation of literature has been banned. However, the government has allowed the printing of certain publications, which is being done, to the joy of the publishers in India. Communications are very difficult between this vast country and other parts of the world at the present time, but we do learn that the work progresses and that they are not slacking their hands, particularly in the new work of back-calls and studies. The report bears this out. Many of the faithful servants of the Lord in Singapore, Burma, and other parts of Asia now overrun by the totalitarian machine of Japan were able to flee from this country and find refuge in India, there to carry on the proclamation of the Kingdom. A very interesting report is received from the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words of David recorded in Psalm 23 were surely written especially for our day, and for the encouragement of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah who now “walk through the valley of the shadow of death” without fear of man or devil. They have been so bountifully fed upon the ‘pasture of tender grass’ as ‘the sheep of his pasture’, and as a result they continue boldly to bear witness to the name of Jehovah and His Theocratic Government. Through the year that is past the witnesses in India have not missed a single feast from the table of the Lord. Every single issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and each new publication, has reached us, and that in the face of increased opposition and hindrance on the part of those who seek to interfere with these supplies of truth. Truly Jehovah is our Shepherd. We lack nothing. He has spread a table before us in the presence of our enemies; we are strong because we know we are backed up and guided by our Head, the Anointed One; our cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow us all the days of our life, and we will, by His grace, dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The actual figures showing field service will be shown in tabulated form elsewhere. The placement of literature during the year has been limited by the interference on the part of the governments with our supplies. In spite of this interference, however, there have been placed in the hands of the public some 5,300 bound books, about 54,000 booklets, and some 60,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> leaflets, besides the books loaned to people attending model studies. The number of publishers regularly in the field is slightly greater than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We received instructions regarding the new method of work in the month of February. We immediately got into line and started this home Bible study campaign, each individual having his own section of territory, working it at least four times, and endeavoring to organize regular study groups. Almost all the English-speaking pioneers were invited to enroll as special publishers, but some have found the strain of trying to reach the 175 hours quota too severe in the summer months of this climate and have to lay off for a time in order to recuperate. One or two have reached their quota, and those who manifest the proper zeal and strive to get in as much time as they are physically capable of are being maintained in the special publisher category. Inasmuch as we have not had sufficient literature to enable a pioneer to maintain himself without some financial assistance, all the pioneers without private means have required some assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Watchtower’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is just marvelous how the Lord has kept us supplied with the spiritual food so necessary to his people in these days. When supplies began to be interfered with, and we were sometimes several weeks without any new issue, some began to think the end had come; but the Lord knew our needs and he also knew we still had more work to do in this land. All bulk supplies and most of the individually addressed copies have ceased to come through, but we have not missed a single issue of the magazine, and as each issue is received it is duplicated and sent out to all subscribers. We never had a richer feast. The study of Daniel 11 was a thriller, but the present studies in Micah’s prophecy are even more wonderful. We sometimes read a portion of the prophecy and it is all ‘double Dutch’, but as soon as we receive the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study of it everything is plain and simple. Truly Jehovah has given his people the “key of knowledge” and ‘prepared a table before us in the presence of our enemies’, and we rejoice and give thanks therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order that we may have a larger share in placing these vital truths before the people a special edition of the study on Jeremiah 16 (“Final Gathering”) is now being printed, and by means of it we propose making a determined effort during the coming year to get every model study attendant to become a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> student. Street witnessing will also be undertaken as a means of reaching some who otherwise could not be contacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Government Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year opened with the ban on all imports of the Society’s publications still in force. It was hoped that there would be some amendment of this important ban, for Central Government promised to investigate each publication and modify the ban so as to permit the import of specified publications w<sup>r</sup>hich, in its opinion, were not “objectionable”. Much correspondence has passed and several personal interviews have been made regarding this, but so far no decision has been reached by Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Central Government merely prohibited the importation of the Society’s literature into India. They have not ordered any search, seizure or confiscation to be made, but they have not interfered with the provincial governments’ doing just what they liked in this direction. We consider this most unjust and where Central Government stands responsible before Jehovah God. Central Government imposed a ban on the importation of “any document” emanating from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and the provincial governments, without bothering to look at the literature, issue orders to have it seized and forfeited to His Majesty because, say they, it is “prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war”. Just how the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead? </span><span class="font5">and publications treating on similar subject matter, could possibly interfere with their political or war activities is a point which they might explain to the Lord when He rises up to the prey to execute his judgment upon them. Central Government is something like an old man with some grownup sons whom he cannot control. Central Government knows perfectly well that Jehovah’s witnesses are law-abiding citizens who have never been guilty of participation in any political activity. They know full well that not one of the Society’s publications contains anything seditious, or subversive to the authority of the State, and while some of the publications do contain Scriptural comment concerning the governments of this world, Central Government knows that many of the Society’s publications contain nothing that is even remotely associated with the war effort or political subject, and yet they make a sweeping ban of all the Society’s publications and close their eyes to the rank injustice of having these seized and confiscated by the provincial governments, who, probably, have never bothered to look inside the books to see what they actually contain. For this we say the Central Government stands guilty before Almighty God for aiding in the persecution of faithful Christians who are entirely innocent of any crime whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrests and Imprisonment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In March, 1942, a special pioneer publisher, a Persian subject, was arrested at Lahore without warrant and detained in jail under the Defence of India Rules. Repeated requests and personal interviews were made to various authorities to state the offense for which this man was imprisoned. Strong suspicion rests upon a certain clergyman of the Church of England for making a false and malicious report to the police against this pioneer, thereby causing his arrest and imprisonment. The clergyman has been asked point-blank whether he made such a report, but he refuses to answer. He too stands before Jehovah’s great Judge to answer for his wickedness. The pioneer was detained for three months and then released. To this day he does not know what his offense was supposed to be. He is, at the time of writing this report, still on the same territory as he was when he was arrested and still doing the same work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In July another special publisher, a sister this time, was working in her home district where she has lived practically all her life. She was served with an order by the authority of the governor of Madras, who, by the way, is a Roman Catholic, to quit that district within one week. Note that she was not ordered to leave the province (probably because the Defence of India Rules do not permit one ordinarily resident in a province to be externed from that province), but merely to leave a certain district. The reason given for such order was that her presence was considered “prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war”! Just how her presence in one certain district could be any more dangerous to the State than in another is a question which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Madras government might be able to explain to the Lord when called upon to do so. Inasmuch as the principle of the freedom to worship Almighty God was at stake by reason of this order, and that it was plainly contrary to the law and commandment of Almighty God, there was no other course left open but to disobey the order. An appeal was made to the governor to cancel the order, but he refused. This young sister, therefore, carried on her God-given work where she was, and was arrested and sentenced to 18 months’ simple imprisonment for putting the law of God before the law of man. A further petition has been made to the governor, drawing attention to this violation of the freedom of worship of Almighty God and requesting that information be given to show grounds for the serving of such an order. His reply is awaited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this fiscal year some 8,000 books and 13,600 booklets containing the truth of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus have been seized and confiscated by the various provincial governments in India, making a total so far seized of about 11,000 bound books and 67,000 booklets. To this extent is the Government of India responsible before Almighty God for ‘turning aside the stranger from his right’.—Mal. 3 : 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the news of the great assembly at St. Louis two assemblies were arranged in India during this fiscal year for the English-speaking friends. The first was held at Madras, in November, and was a wonderful manifestation of the Lord’s power and care for us. A few days before the date fixed for the gathering the commissioner of police in Madras issued an order prohibiting the holding of any convention, procession or meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society within the city of Madras. The Lord evidently wanted his people to gather together, and they did. The convention servant immediately set about to look for accommodation outside the city limits, and here, sure enough, was the first clear evidence of the Lord’s hand in the matter. The very first house outside the city limits, on a certain busy main road, and amidst a populous district, was vacant. It was a very large bungalow in spacious grounds; just the thing we wanted. It was rented and accommodated 35 visiting friends and afforded a better meeting hall for the study sessions than the place previously contracted for. A large public hall in the center of the city had been engaged for a public reproduction of the “Religion as a World Remedy” lecture and leaflets advertising this lecture were printed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 8 had also been printed for distribution on this occasion. The public hall was now closed to us; so we had the leaflets overprinted with the words, “Cancelled by Police—Another Catholic-Fascist Victory?” and distributed these along with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 8 (British edition) all over Madras city and suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A month later a similar assembly was arranged in Delhi, the seat of the Central Government, and a similar program carried through. On this occasion there was no interference but we were all watched and followed by C.I.D. men most of the time. On this occasion we covered all “official” Delhi as well as the general population with a special leaflet entitled “Theocracy”, being an extract from the article of that title </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font5"> booklet. At each of these two assemblies there were between thirty and forty friends present, representing the majority of the active English-speaking witnesses in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An assembly for the native Indian brethren in Travancore was also held in September last, besides which several public meetings have been organized in various parts of the state at which brethren from the surrounding district gathered and many interesting experiences were related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Travancore the brethren have had to work solely with Bible portions, as practically all their literature was seized, and no further printing could be done within the state, as our own printing press had been seized and other printers were afraid of handling our work. There is not much scope for English literature down there, though we were able to get some into the state and it has been distributed. The Roman Catholics manifested more opposition than usual, and on one occasion a mob threw cowdung at the speaker; but the following day he visited every house in the village and offered them the message of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We received a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font5"> booklet at the beginning of the year and soon got to work with the printing of it. Two editions were printed in different parts of the country and they have gone out well, though seizures of this booklet have taken place within recent months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The original sample copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book sent to us from Brooklyn never reached us. After a time we received a copy of the British edition, and also one of the Australian edition. Later we received a single copy of the American edition, and also the question booklet. We then made preparations to print our own edition, and at the time of writing this book is on the press. Some of the illustrations and the cover design have been reproduced. We look forward to having our share in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study work during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sample copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font5"> booklet arrived from Brooklyn, and, as this booklet is so obviously quite outside the scope of any Defence of India Rule, we decided to request Government to give us a guarantee that they would not confiscate it when printed. After a considerable delay the Central Government has agreed to exempt this booklet from the operation of its import ban, though it takes great care to say that this expulsion does not preclude provincial governments from proscribing the booklet if they think fit to do so. It is now on the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Evacuees</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the war has come very close to our shores. Immediately Singapore was seriously threatened four or five of the friends from Malaya and Singapore came to India. Then, shortly afterwards the friends from Burma began to filter through. Most of these had a very hazardous journey over the mountains and some were, and still are, quite ill as a result. One died on the way. There are now about forty, including children, from Burma who have been more or less associated with the Society in that land. They are gradually settling down here and some have already taken up active witness work. Three have enrolled as pioneers. Three Australian pioneers working in China also were able to get across into India by plane, one of whom has taken up pioneer work in this country, and the other two returned to Australia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Ceylon has not progressed during the year. No importation of the Society’s literature is permitted into the island, though single copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and other publications have been sent to those who have requested them. There is only one active publisher there and he appears to be doing what he can. Reports of field service have come through irregularly and more work might have been done there if those who profess to be devoted to the Lord were more zealous, but it does not seem possible to do very much in Ceylon from this country while conditions continue as they are at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outlook for the coming year is bright. We know, of course, that the modern “Assyrian” is invading our “land” and that the forces of evil represented by “the king of the north” led by the Devil will soon “go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many”, but we are happy, calm and confident that the great Jehovah God, whom we serve, and whose we are, will lead us as a shepherd leads and protects his flock. We wait patiently for him and fret not because of evildoers, for we know that they shall soon ‘be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb’. Thus trusting in the Lord, and dwelling in “the land”, we know that we shall be fed (Psalm 37), and we therefore go forth into the coming year with renewed determination to be faithful and true witnesses of the great Eternal God, the Rock of Ages, following the Lamb whithersoever he leads us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren on the island of Jamaica who are faithful to their covenant with Jehovah God are putting forth good efforts to magnify the Lord’s name. For some time now it has been impossible to get any literature to these publishers for the Kingdom, and because of the lack of literature it has entered the minds of some that the work is finished. The majority, however, see the importance of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and doing it as was done in the days of the apostles, going from place to place and preaching 'the kingdom of heaven is at hand’. It is believed those who have slacked the hand will again see their privilege and will join in the Victory Song. The ban has been on in this island so strongly that even the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine has been withheld from them, except on a few occasions, and thus a lack of spiritual food has made some to wonder if the work is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Singing the praises of Jehovah will never be finished, and as long as creatures have breath a song of gladness and appreciation of life will be given unto the Creator. Every effort is made on the part of the Society to get to these brethren “meat in due season”, and the local Branch servant is trying to help all in that land to see the importance of conducting book studies with the literature that has already been placed in the homes of the people of good-will. There is a good increase in back-calls. During the year 25,720 have been made, but the average for the company publisher is only 1.4 per publisher per month. Practically all the literature that was on the island at the beginning of the ban has now been distributed. The local servant reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can be no actual basis for comparison of the output of literature this year just closing with that of the previous year, because imports stopped in September, 1941. The pioneer work has been discontinued because there is no more literature now with which to supply them. The 62 publishers engaging in pioneer service have returned to their respective companies and are doing what they can in preaching the gospel, using Bibles if they are obtainable, otherwise doing as did the apostles, preaching from house to house and city to city. The report for 1941 shows 953 publishers in the field, whereas the report for September 1942 showed 591 engaging in the proclamation of the Kingdom. However, the active servants were blessed with the distribution of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">115,700 books and booklets, to compare with the 99,205 of the previous year. Hours in the field have increased over that of last year, even though there are fewer publishers, which shows that those publishers working have the proper appreciation of their responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Getting about is difficult because of petrol rationing. The Society’s car is stored. In July the local Branch arranged for a convention of the Lord’s people. A good witness was given and the brethren were admonished that on their returning home they continue to carry on the witness work even though they had no supplies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Mexico is moving ahead at a good pace. The brethren are beginning to see more clearly the importance of aiding the people of good-will and that this must be done by making back-calls, conducting model studies, etc. This naturally has cut into the distribution of literature considerably. Thousands of booklets were placed in street witnessing along with magazines previously, but during the last year the brethren were encouraged to spend more time in door-to-door witnessing rather than street work. The placing of literature for the sake of placing literature is not the important thing, but our commission is to aid those people who have the literature to read and study it. This requires more time. The report shows that during the last fiscal year there were 1,188 publishers engaged in field service, as compared with 859 the previous year. Back-calls have increased splendidly. Instead of 25,720 made in 1941, the publishers made 43,399 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is hoped that the work in Mexico will be organized even better than it is now, and there are millions of people in this country that need assistance. There is a large field for Spanish-speaking publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report from the servant brings to our attention the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will notice there is a decrease in the amount of literature placed. This is due to the new work that was begun in Mexico. Nevertheless, in other respects figures come up, especially insofar as publishers and visits are concerned. The fishing and hunting in these territories, by the Lord’s grace, keeps the friends busy and all are becoming proficient in it. In the previous year we had lots of sidewalk witnessing with self-covered booklets, and the results were splendid. That was one reason for placing almost 300,000 more pieces of literature than in this fiscal year. This year, however, we were attending especially to visits and studies, and, now that we have the Spanish model studies and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children, </span><span class="font5">the prospects are that studies and back-calls will materially increase during the coming year. We are better prepared to continue the work of instructing the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine distribution, though not reaching the high mark of the previous year, was not so bad after all. We are still able to receive literature from Brooklyn. Instead of sending it to Mexico by boat, it is now coming through by rail. We received 79,804 books and 602,640 booklets. This has kept our stock at a good balance and we have a fair supply to begin the new year. We are grateful for the new publications received, and are beginning distribution (in the Spanish language) of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety, God and the State, Comfort All That Mourn, Theocracy, Model Study</span><span class="font5"> 2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His Works,</span><span class="font5"> and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> These are fine equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch office in Mexico City has its own pressroom. This has been kept quite busy printing 27,500 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font5">171,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font5"> and many office forms, free leaflets, calendars, and the convention programs. The office has been very busy doing translating of the new publications, as well as attending to the office work required in handling 6,488 letters. There were shipped out from the shipping department to companies and pioneers and individuals 9,188 large packages and 81,623 smaller packages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the Memorial there were present 2,629, and of those attending 142 partook. It appears that a large number of the “other sheep” will yet make themselves manifest in Mexico and, by the Lord’s grace, we want to reach these. During the year 536 symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposition to the work is on the increase, but the faithful servants of the Lord take care of the problems as they arise. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is gaining ground rapidly in this land. The Mexican government for some years tried to curtail religion in its interfering with governmental activities, but now their influence is being winked at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The high point of the year came in September when the brethren of Mexico attended the New World Theocratic Assembly, showing great enthusiasm. It was much more difficult for the brethren to get to this convention because of serious economic distress, but the brethren overcame all difficulties and a greater number was able to attend the assembly in Mexico City than ever before. Many were so anxious to come and did come having fare for only one way, trusting in the Lord to arrange something for their return. They received the blessing of the Lord and somehow or other did return home. The first day 1,200 were present, and the attendance came up to 1,600 by Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The program in Mexico City was identical with that in the United States, even to the picture on the front of the program itself. All the talks were supplied in advance, translations made into Spanish, and delivered according to schedule. The Lord spread an abundant table for us in the presence of our enemies. The resolution was unanimously accepted by the fighters for the New World in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the time came for parting all went back to their assigned posts with new vigor and with new instructions, ready to hold on to their rights to worship and fight in the interests of The Theocracy. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> in Spanish and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His Works</span><span class="font5"> in Spanish were released at this assembly, for the first time. The Lord surely crowned the year with his blessing. The detailed report of field service follows.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The countries in northern Europe had been directed from an office in Denmark. Since the totalitarian aggression considerable interference has been experienced in the work. Denmark has been overrun and the Branch servant put in a concentration camp. Norway has been sold out to the Quislings and the property there is reported confiscated. The brethren have been dispersed, but not forsaken by the Lord. Nothing more is heard of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Finland has joined hands with the Axis, and the principles of freedom for which it stood are now rapidly fading. Sweden, a neutral country hemmed in on every side by Axis powers, still forges ahead, and it is through this country that the only communication concerning the above-named nations is possible. Despite the fact of being in the midst of this terrible war, reports from this part of the world show a remarkable increase. You will note, when you read the report on Sweden, that the publishers have increased in number. There are still 172 pioneers working there, and more companies are now organized, namely, 135. More back-calls are being made on the people of good-will, and this is due to reorganization, following the new method of work suggested in the early part of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A report comes through from Finland that shows the same number of publishers active, with fewer hours and fewer back-calls; but, considering the terrible conditions that exist there and the regimentation under which the people have been put, even this is amazing. In Denmark the people of good-will have associated themselves with the Lord’s organization and the publishers have increased from 1,600 to 2,400. More back-calls have been made and more hours spent in the field service than at any time heretofore. All this shows the determination on the part of our brethren in this part of the globe to remain true and steadfast and defeat persecution. The reports from the various countries are incomplete, but from reports received the following is gleaned:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The brother in Denmark who looks after the work generally is able to communicate from time to time with the servant in Sweden and get messages through. Our faithful brother who for years worked and looked after the interests of the Kingdom in Denmark and the other countries in Northern Europe has been in a concentration camp for well over a year. He has some association and is allowed visitors. He is able to speak with individuals in the camp concerning the Kingdom, and he enjoys these privileges. Many of the other brethren in Denmark, however, have been allowed freedom during the year, and wonderful results have been accomplished. The “other sheep” are being ‘hunted out’ and are being brought into the fold; and the 2,473 publishers there, the greatest number to date, have devoted 180,191 hours in the field service. The literature on hand in this country is being put to excellent use; 468,985 books and booklets were distributed, and 102,677 individual magazines. The “meat in due season” gets to the readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> It gets to them late, but eventually. The brethren there see the importance of back-calls and the conducting of studies, and this takes up much of their time. The report given above, which is not complete, but merely for eight months, shows that 64,594 back-calls were made. If the year’s report could be compiled and sent through, a much greater witness would be shown. Very little news comes out of Denmark as to just how the brethren are faring, but the reports that do get through show they are faithful, the work increases, and the people of good-will are taking their stand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the year the meager reports that got out of Finland into Sweden have been compiled, and thus far only seven months of the report have been received at the Brooklyn office; but this seven months’ report show’s that the brethren have not slacked their hands. The local office and printing equipment once operated by the Society were disposed of after the Society could no longer operate there, and are now in the hands of some faithful brethren carrying on regular printing business. From time to time those things required by the brethren for the advancement of the Kingdom work are produced here. From the last reports, the truth continues to reach our brethren throughout Finland, but is very belated, as communications are slow. What literature they have on hand they are still distributing, and in seven months they have placed 68,774 books and booklets and 171,212 magazines, in addition to the regular subscriptions that are mailed out. The last report received indicated that the Branch servant had been put in jail and the only ones allowed to visit him were his immediate family. Even though he is taken away and isolated, this has not slacked the hand of the faithful. While they miss their association, they know that Christ Jesus is the Leader, and they continue to preach this gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This country being a neutral, at different seasons of the year some mail is allowed to go through, and thus they have received almost all of the “meat in due season”. The report from Sweden is very interesting and shows a splendid increase in number of publishers, back-calls and hours in the field service. This has, as the report shows, been due to the fact that they are trying to carry out to the very best of their ability the new instructions on organizing studies. The servant’s report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have pleasure in forwarding herewith the eight months’ report as requested by you, showing the results of our activities in serving the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As will be seen, there is a healthy increase in the highest number of publishers, from 1,901 to 2,267, and the hours spent in the work have gone up from 249,545 to 296,469. Seven new companies have been formed, and those who symbolized their consecration during the eight months total 262. The placement of literature has been marked by a big increase in bound books, from 50,619 to 74,716, which is due to the arrival of the new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> The placement of booklets, on the other hand, has dropped from 657,716 to 477,850, mainly because only one new item has appeared, viz., </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most outstanding feature of the period covered by this report was, of course, the new work, which started here on March 15, and which has been responsible for the increase in the number of back-calls and model studies. Back-calls have increased from 71,312 to 93,675, and model studies from 4,247, attended by 15,376, to 7,638, attended by 25,135. When this work has had sufficient time, there is no doubt that our numbers in the field will increase materially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another outstanding feature was the doing away with the zone arrangement according to the president’s letter of October 24 This letter, by the way, was the last one to reach us from Headquarters before the postal isolation of more than four months’ duration, which was caused by the entrance of America into the war. These instructions, which could, in a way, be likened to a bird’s breaking up the nest and causing her young ones to use their own wings, became effective in this country during the month of April, and there is no doubt that the Lord caused this to happen just at the right time, in view of the conditions obtaining in this part of the world. In this connection the “special publisher” arrangement was begun, with a nucleus of twelve, who are already reporting good results and many fine experiences. Month by month the number of these publishers is being added to. In all there have been 172 brethren serving as pioneer publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sound Work is down from 178,168 to 151,435 in the total of attendance. This is to a large extent due to the conditions now prevailing which hinder the running of these lectures in certain parts of the country, and, as many pioneers have also been called up for considerable periods of time, they have been unable to use their “trumpets” to the extent they used to do. During this coming summer we are expecting good results in this line of the work by the use of the seven loud-speaker outfits, which have been completed during the winter and put to work this spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine Work. This work, which to a large extent has been carried on on the streets except during the worst of the winter, has increased as regards the number of individual magazines placed, from 160,409 to 235,461, whereas the number of new subscriptions taken has fallen from 22,704 to 16,065. The total subscription list, however, shows an increase at the end of these eight months, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">from 6,388 to 6,646, and for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> from 56,743 to 59,257. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign could not start here until June; so the comparison in the number of new subscriptions is not exactly a fair one. The figures at the end of the year will, however, give that. There is no doubt that the street work has made Jehovah’s witnesses and their message known amongst the people in a hitherto unequaled way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Opposition to our work has become much more marked during this year than before, and the Devil’s henchmen are trying to make use of the world situation in order to hinder, if possible, the proclamation of the Theocratic message. By the Lord’s grace, however, the servants of The Theocracy are not frightened, but are using every opportunity to press the battle to the gate, and have hitherto been successful in making each attack a boomerang that has hit the enemy well and hard. What the next few months are holding in store for us only the Lord knows, of course, but the signs are</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that the enemy is going to take severer measures against this “undesirable element”. The opposition encountered has been met by special street work, public meetings, articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> replies to the press, which have occasionally been published, and by other means that have offered the opportunity of giving a good witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The figures available for the eight months’ report for Denmark are also enclosed. The recent difficulties in Finland make it impossible to obtain figures for May; so a seven months’ report is enclosed herewith. In both cases details as regards pioneers, company workers, etc., are not available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When conditions in Europe at this time are considered, it is impossible not to feel extreme gratitude to the Lord for the privilege of being able to hold up the standard of The Theocracy and of seeing still more people of good-will Tallying to that standard, and it is therefore with much thankfulness that these reports are submitted. I hope it will be possible to forward reports for the year in due course.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the sneak attack of the Japs on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the war with the United States the work in the Philippine Islands had reached a peak. The last monthly report received from there showed that there were 373 publishers in the field and that 84 of these brethren were pioneers. In one month’s time they devoted 16,000 hours to the work. Their placements were nearly 18,000 books and booklets. Many newly interested persons w<sup>r</sup>ere associating themselves with the Lord’s organization and seeking the way to life, and in a recent report it was pointed out that two young college students forsook everything to take up the pioneer service of proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. With great suddenness the reports from the Philippine Islands ceased, and the last word received, by cable, a few days after the Japanese attack, was: “Greetings. Work paralyzed. Brethren determined to ‘comfort all that mourn’.” We feel sure that as long as these brethren have breath they will praise the Lord. We have the assuring words of the King, “Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful.”—Ps. 101: 6.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The annual report from the Branch servant at Cape Town, South Africa, shows that the brethren in that section of the world have not slacked the hand because of the opposition or lack of literature, but rather there has been an increase. The increase is definitely marked in publishers, hours, and back-calls. In the other columns of their annual report under books, booklets and subscriptions there is a decrease. This is no fault of the publishers, but is due to censorship. In the report of all the countries under the direction of this branch it is shown that there is an increase of 1,705 publishers over the previous year, an increase of 358,615 hours, and an increase of 294,404 back-calls. This is as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren there are not without their trials and difficulties. The report well shows this. The people who love righteousness and learn of the truth are not fearful of the reproach that will fall upon them because of being Christians, and the record shows that they are taking their stand in this land as they are everywhere else. The greatest number of publishers for the Kingdom in these South African countries appears this year, there being an average of 6,175 publishers actively engaging in the service each month. Those taking their stand for the New World reached a peak of 8,076 during the year. Due to shortage of literature the pioneers are having it a little more difficult; but there are 79 pioneers working regularly, and these, by the Lord’s grace, are organizing new companies wherever possible. In some of the darkest parts of Africa there are now companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, and this much to the dislike of the clergy and religionists who thought they had a good grip on the natives of this continent. There are now 474 companies organized, and they are putting forth every effort to advance the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While censorship controls the ports and they will not allow literature to enter, it has been possible to print fairly large quantities of our own publications within the South African territory itself. This has added impetus to the work and aided the brethren in keeping the latest information before the people of good-will, and it has been a joy to all to conduct </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> studies and carry on the greatest campaign of back-calling ever arranged in this territory. The servant’s report is most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah caused his prophet to write concerning the great Theocratic Government: “Of the increase of his government there shall be no end.” The King of The Theocracy, Christ Jesus, has come. For some years the prophetic statement concerning him has been in course of fulfillment, viz., ‘Thou shalt rule in the midst of thine enemies.’ In the face of ever-increasing opposition from those who will not accept the good counsel given to them, as recorded at Psalm 2, “this gospel of the kingdom” has been preached. Here in South Africa, in common with other parts of the earth, the flood of truth, flowing from God’s holy temple, has continued to increase in volume during the past twenty years, bringing enlightenment and comfort to those that mourn and, at the same time, acting as a warning to the anti-Theocratic forces. Year by year Jehovah has added his blessing to the devoted efforts of his witnesses to magnify his name and has given the increase. The past year has been no exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With a total prohibition placed on the importation of all our Bible-study books eighteen months ago, it was, no doubt, thought in some quarters, ‘Now we have these Jehovah’s witnesses and their Kingdom message where we want them.’ But such misguided ones do not realize that it is the Lord’s message and work they try to proscribe and that no power on earth can successfully interfere with the declared purpose of the Almighty to have the witness given of and concerning The Theocracy. They overlook the fact that the same One who hade his disciples 1900 years ago, ‘Preach, saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand,’ gave as one of the proofs of his second advent (Matt. 24: 14) “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it is not surprising to find that the past year has been “the best yet” in Kingdom activity. True, the restrictions placed on the importation of our Bible-study books has greatly curtailed the wide-spread distribution of the Kingdom message in printed form as in former years, but, even so, more real and effective work in the interest of the Kingdom and those seeking it has been accomplished than in any previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publishers : In the Union of South Africa the peak of publishers was 1,582, which represents an increase of 26 percent on the peak figure attained in the previous year. The average number in action each month was 1,357, to compare with 981 in 1941. The total number of hours spent in field service amounted to 386,764. The figure in 1941 was 289,278. The pioneers, of whom there was a monthly average of 62, maintained an average of 136 hours per month; while the company publishers attained new heights, with an average of 18.4 hours each month. It will thus be seen that the publishers have manifested greater zeal than ever before and in consequence the volume of work accomplished is easily the best to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publication : Thanks to the bountiful provision made by the brethren at headquarters, whose privilege it is to furnish and equip the branches for all good works, we had good supplies of Kingdom literature in the country when the ban on importation took place, and such equipment and the vast amount of literature already in the hands of the people have enabled the greatest Bible-study campaign that South Africa has ever witnessed to be carried forward most effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past twelve months the publishers have distributed 39,701 bound volumes, 299,069 booklets, and 62,683 magazines. In the first five months of the service year the zone arrangement was still in operation and the work proceeded as in former years. Towards the end of 1941, however, we were obliged to conserve supplies for the pioneers and it was just at that time that word came to hand regarding the new work. Commencing January, therefore, the new work was launched. It was taken up with enthusiasm. Company publishers have been mainly loaning the literature to the interested from that time onward. The prophecy “Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased” is surely having its fulfillment. The dust which had been allowed to accumulate on many a Bible up and down the country has now been swept away and thousands of honest-hearted persons of good-will have been making a careful scrutiny of God’s Word and have learned for the first time that the Scriptures are able to make them “wise unto salvation”. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> which sets forth the fundamental doctrines of the Bible in such simple language that even young children can understand, has been loaned and re-loaned, read and studied with the greatest profit by those who have a sincere desire to understand the purposes of Almighty God. The study folders have been a great help in enabling one to get a quick, comprehensive grasp of the contents of the book before making a more detailed study. Now the scripture at Jeremiah 16:16 is having fulfillment and many of those seen by John in his vision as recorded at Revelation 7: 9 are coming forward and ‘ascribing salvation unto Jehovah and unto the Lamb’. Even our religious enemies who are back of the action taken against the Kingdom literature are forced to admit that the charges made by them that Jehovah’s witnesses are “booksellers” and subversive are entirely false; which fact, of course, they have known all along. The people of good-will know that Jehovah’s witnesses are unselfishly devoted to the great Theocrat and that it is their love for Him and for them that moves them to serve the people at this time with the message of the Bible. Many have been greatly comforted and now lift up their heads and rejoice in the sure hope of the long promised Kingdom of Righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls and Model Studies: The back-call and model study features show a great increase. From August to December, 26,093 back-calls were made; from January to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">July, 57,009, of which number 27,495 were model studies. The total attendance at these model studies was 72,369. In addition, 1,999 book studies were held, with an attendance of 13,802. The pioneers averaged 35 back-calls (21 model studies) per month; and the company publishers, 3.7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Advertising : </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 10 has had a wide distribution in both English and Afrikaans. The certain hope of life in the new earth under new heavens is a real message of good news for the war-stricken peoples of the old world now in its death throes. What a contrast between God’s “New Order” and the various ‘new orders’ proposed by men on earth! The Kingdom Hall leaflets also have been put to good use throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Organization : With the end of the zone work the companies and individual publishers have been learning to ‘bear their own burdens’, and the instruction and training they have received during the past three years is standing them in good stead. Since January the brethren who formerly served as zone servants have been engaged in special publisher activity, and the Lord’s blessing has been upon this arrangement. The end of the service year finds us with 176 company organizations, 21 of which have come into existence during the past three or four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Convention : The various features of the Society’s 1941 Theocratic convention were duplicated on a miniature scale, to the great blessing and encouragement of the South African brethren, at a convention in Johannesburg, April 3-6. There were some 1,700 present, including 340 children between the ages of 5 and 18. This is more than double the number who attended the 1941 South African convention. Enthusiasm reached a peak on “Children’s Day” when all the children present, young and old, received a gracious gift from the Lord. Were we happy? We have had many gifts in the past, and much better-looking ones, too, but surely none more precious than the one we received on that occasion. “And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” Much helpful Theocratic instruction was received, and we were greatly enthused thereby. The Calendar for 1942 was also released at the convention and was received with great joy and acclamation. Our main purpose in assembling was, of course, not </span><span class="font5">to receive, but to give; and it was the spirit of unselfish devotion to the great Theoerat manifested by all present that made the convention the success it was. During the week-end 1,066 publishers were in field service, spending 5,237 hours in the witness work. In all, 687 volumes, 8,190 booklets, and 2,919 magazines, were placed. Back-calls numbered 632; and model studies held, 154. The sound attendance was 3,170. Surely a mighty witness to the incoming Theocratic Government. At this convention 400 symbolized their consecration to do the will of God; more than double the previous peak. Half the leaflets advertising the public lectures on “Children of The King” and “Comfort All That Mourn” and a quantity of programs were seized by the Censorship. These were quickly replaced by the Theocratic organization, and when, as a result of representations made, the seized leaflets were released, the day before the convention began, a greater witness than that originally planned was given. A new feature for a South African convention was the provision made on the premises for the physical requirements of those in attendance. Although a new venture, it was, thanks to the willing co-operation of all concerned, an outstanding success. In all, 6,000 meals were served during the week-end; and the arrangement was greatly appreciated. Every province of the Union of South Africa was well represented, and, in addition, publishers came from Northern Rhodesia, Nyasa-land and Portuguese East Africa. “The people that know their God” were invigorated and refreshed, and their vision burnished, and they went away fully determined to each bear his own burden in his assigned position on the Theocratic battle-front. This memorable convention was surely a sweet foretaste of the convention that will never end, when every creature on earth and in heaven will be rendering grateful praise to the great Theoerat and His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Testimony Periods : In these days, when mails are less regular, take longer in transit, and go astray as a result of enemy action, we did not always have information on hand in time to enable us to do the same things at the same time as our brethren elsewhere. However, a special effort was made during each of the Testimony periods and that extra effort always brought a special blessing with it. The arrival, in March, of the beautiful text card for 1942 brought us up </span><span class="font5">to date again, and with a new theme song for each month of the year we are surely a happy band of warriors whether we be “aiding refugees”, “comforting all that mourn,” or singing “the victory song”. We know that by joyfully engaging in these Theocratic privileges and conforming ourselves to the law of our “mother” we are greatly assisted in maintaining our integrity and remaining “blameless in the day of our Lord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Memorial : Reports received on Memorial services revealed an attendance of 1,220, of which number 174 partook of the emblems. The previous year the figures were 924 and 168.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Opposition : Looking down to these days in which we live Jesus said of those who would be his followers, “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” The Kingdom work has been carried forward in the face of many difficulties during the past twelve months. Our service year begins with August, and during that month all our outgoing mail was seized by the Censorship authorities. It was several weeks before we knew what was taking place, and then a steady stream of letters came to hand from our friends advising us that no acknowledgment of their reports and donations sent at the beginning of the month had been received. Journals also were missing. The matter was immediately taken up and a protest lodged, but the only reply forthcoming was as follows: “I have to advise you that certain articles were retained at the instance of the Censorship but I regret that no further information in this regard is available.” When one not connected with the Society wrote complaining about his letter from the Society being held up for several weeks he received the following reply from the chief censor: “ &nbsp;—, In the case under enquiry there was no Censorship reason for detaining or delaying what you correctly describe as an innocuous business letter, and as my enquiries reveal that the article was inadvertently misplaced in the office of the Deputy Chief Censor, Cape Town, I beg you to accept my apologies for this occurrence, which has received suitable notice.” These two letters speak for themselves. There was, of course, nothing in any of the Society’s correspondence bearing on the war effort nor anything else justifying this arbitrary and uncalled-for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Legal : Claim for Release of Shipments : As indicated in our last previous report, the commissioner of customs filed an exception to our plea which, among other things, claimed that no opportunity was required by law to be afforded the Society to submit its contentions or evidence. Argument on this Exception was heard at the Supreme Court (Cape Division) on August 25, 1941. Judgment was rendered on September 19 and was in Society’s favor, the exception being dismissed with costs. Leave was given to the commissioner to appeal, but the appeal was not proceeded with. Instead the Government attorney advised us, under date of November 3, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(a) That in view of the Court’s decision in the exception proceedings herein the Minister will rescind his prior decision and will de novo consider the question of objeetionability or otherwise of your client’s literature in issue in this ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(b) That the grounds whereon the said literature is claimed to be objectionable will be furnished in writing to your clients. These grounds are being prepared at the moment, and we are instructed to say that they will be forwarded as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(c) That any representations the Defendants may wish to make to the Minister on the question of objectionability must be furnished in writing within two weeks after receipt by them of the grounds of objectionability mentioned in Par. (b) above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(d) That, if so desired by the Defendants, the Minister will, in addition, be prepared to hear oral submission from a representative of the Defendants. The time, date and place of such hearing can be arranged between us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have further been instructed to notify that in consequence of the aforesaid decision in the exception proceedings the Plaintiff intends asking leave of the Court to amend his declaration by deleting Par. (6) thereof and substituting the following new paragraph (6) therefor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“(6) All the printed matter referred to in Par. (3) hereof is objectionable within the meaning of Section 23 (c) of Act 9 of 1913 (as substituted by Section 6 of Act 40 of 1934).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We naturally accepted the offer to make representations, but refused to agree to the proposed amendment on the grounds that the original declaration amended in that way would disclose no cause of action. Argument on the proposed amendment was heard at the Supreme Court on November 28, and judgment rendered on December 15. The judgment was again in the Society’s favor and our contention was upheld by the Court. The press throughout the country carried reports of these actions, and this served to keep the Society’s name before the people and to let them know of our fight for freedom of worship. The other side then took this point to the highest court in the land, and, although we had been told by the legal fraternity that “we couldn’t lose”, the Appellate Division on 25th March 1942 reversed the decision of the lower court and allowed the amendment. The declaration as it now stands leaves out any reference to the minister’s having decided on the objectionability or otherwise of the literature. Leave was also given by the Appellate Division to the Society to amend its plea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eventually, early in April, and after the fight had been in progress a whole year, we received the “Grounds upon which the publications seized are contended to be objectionable”. The preamble runs as follows: “Having regard to current times, the composition of the population of the Union, the relatively low standard of education of a considerable section of that population, and to the existing divergence of views amongst the inhabitants of the Union of matters political, economic and religious, the publications are—both individually and collectively—likely and then follows what we have frequently read in the Roman Catholic press. You will observe the word “likely”. There is not one word from start to finish that they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">have done</span><span class="font5"> thus and so; but because someone or other thinks they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“likely” </span><span class="font5">to do thus and so they are withheld from us. One would have thought that the fact that the literature has circulated for the past thirty and more years without any one of the things feared having taken place would in itself be sufficient to indicate that there was no justification for the action taken. We were given fourteen days in which to reply, and our written representations were filed with the Government attorneys on 15th April. At the same time we intimated our desire to make oral representations in harmony with the offer made. At the time of writing, four months after submitting the written representations, the minister of the Interior has not yet fixed the date of the hearing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) On September 6, 1941, barely a fortnight after the first hearing in the Customs case, an effort was made on an order issued by the minister of the Interior under the Emergency Regulations to seize all of the Society’s publications in this country. The C.I.D. arrived at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning to execute the order. It was quickly seen that the order was not in harmony with the Regulations, and while the C.I.D. officers marked time at the Society’s office the Branch servant made an urgent application to the Supreme Court for an interdict to restrain the minister or the police from seizing the literature. The application was successful. By twelve o’clock a temporary interdict was obtained from the only judge on duty that day, and the police lorries had to return as they came—without the Kingdom literature. On the return day, five days later, the minister withdrew the order and offered to pay our costs. There was great rejoicing in the Theocratic camp over this victory which the Lord gave us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) The Afrikaans magazine entitled “Vertroosting” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Consolation)</span><span class="font5"> was banned on June 12 under the Customs Act which governs importations. As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting</span><span class="font5"> is printed and published in South Africa it was clear that the minister’s action was ultra vires. Although the evidence was clear on this point a pioneer was convicted by the magistrate at Kroonstad for distributing the magazine. The case was appealed, and at the Supreme Court the judgment was reversed and the conviction set aside. On September 12 the Government Gazette intimated the withdrawal of the ban and ‘Wisdom continued to utter her voice in the streets’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(4) On December 20, 1941, and therefore just five days after the judgment delivered in the Society’s favor in the Customs case at the Supreme Court, the chief control officer of the Union issued an order under the Emergency Regulations authorizing the seizure of six of the Society’s publications. An application was made to the Supreme Court to have this order declared illegal. The Supreme Court, however, refused to make an order on the application. An appeal was noted, and this case will probably go to trial at a later stage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">As a result of the above legal actions and the newspaper publicity in connection therewith many honest-hearted people began to inquire: “Who are these Jehovah’s witnesses? What is the message contained in their literature? Why are they being persecuted for their faith? Is this war not being fought for freedom of worship? Why should their Biblestudy books be withheld from them ? Surely it must be someone with a religious ax to grind who is back of it all 1” etc., etc. The introduction to the 1941 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> under the caption “Jehovah’s witnesses: Who Are They? What Is Their Work?” was given </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> wide distribution in both English and Afrikaans particularly during the month of October. The interest was so great that not a copy was available in either language at the end of that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In November return visits were made on those who had obtained a copy of the booklet and the various recordings were extensively used. The interested gladly availed themselves of the opportunity to obtain additional Bible helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of spreading the Kingdom message has gone forward in Southern Rhodesia as in other countries, the total ban on the importation and distribution of literature notwithstanding. The legal case to which reference was made in last year’s report went to the Appellate Division and was heard by a full bench and the judgment rendered at the Supreme Court of Southern Rhodesia confirmed. The merits of the literature, of course, were not under consideration, but merely the legal points centering around the governor’s right to make the regulation and as to whether the minister’s order was in harmony with the regulation. The court was not concerned about the contents of the literature. A number of brethren, including sisters, have been imprisoned; some of them on several occasions. Others, born in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were deported. The African zone servant w’ho had been in Southern Rhodesia for thirteen years with an absolutely clean record was one of those deported. An appeal and protest were lodged with the governor, but he refused to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witnesses resident in the colony then prepared and published a booklet entitled “Jehovah’s witnesses: Who Are They? What Is Their Work?” Copies were posted to the governor, prime minister, etc., and general distribution commenced. Arrests followed. One brother was charged with “being concerned in the distribution of a publication published by the Southern Rhodesian branch of Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society”. The case lasted all day and a good witness was given. It was brought out that the government had never permitted the Society to establish a branch in that country, and the publisher was found not guilty. The magistrate had made a careful study of several </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Yearbooks,</span><span class="font5"> etc., and, in his reasons for judgment, gave a masterly exposition of the relationship existing between head office, branches, regionals, zone servants and companies. The Bulawayo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> published it more or less in full and a further excellent witness was given. Meanwhile, at the other end of the country the one who had made the copies was charged with importing and publishing prohibited literature. Although it was brought out that he had not imported it and that it was not a publication of the Society the magistrate found him guilty as the publication concerned contained “extracts” from prohibited literature. The case was appealed, and at the High Court the two judges disagreed and a fresh trial was ordered. Three judges then heard the case and the result this time was 2 to 1 in favor of the magistrate. The dissenting judgment is sound and the case has now been taken to the Appellate Division. And so “by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; ... as poor, yet making many rich” the work of announcing the Theocratic Government proceeds. Reports indicate that there are some of the Lord’s “other sheep” in that country and they are now coming forward and seeking refuge in the Lord’s organization. During the past twelve months there has been an average of 617 publishers per month, to compare with 477 the previous year. These are all company publishers, and they averaged 21.4 hours and 5.2 back-calls per month. The detailed report is attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conditions in Northern Rhodesia have been difficult. The depot servant has spent eight months out of twelve in prison. It is a crime even to have the Kingdom literature in one’s possession in that benighted country. “The Sword of the Spirit” movement, however, goes from strength to strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there has been a monthly average of 9 pioneers and 1,983 company publishers, to compare with 1,415 last year. The pioneers averaged 127 hours and 10 back-calls per month; and the company publishers, 27 hours and .8 back-calls. These figures are considerably in excess of those of the previous twelve months. Letters received numbered 1,465, and 2,199 were sent out. There are 138 company organizations. The depot servant reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The model studies have only just commenced to be recorded and this phase of Kingdom work, though small, is being participated in with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Reading, at the best, is slow and deliberate for most Africans and little more than the words directly under consideration are held in the mind by the reader. On the railbead the number of those with much more intelligent minds is, quite naturally, much larger, but even then evidence of inductive reasoning is seldom found and each scriptural point needs an explanation even though parallel circumstances have repeatedly been covered. To add to this difficulty, Northern Rhodesia is peculiar for its many vernaculars, considering its small population of about li million, and in very few of these is the whole Bible obtainable; in several cases copies of the New Testament only or of just single Gospels or of the Acts of the Apostles have been printed and are available. ‘The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few,’ and the zeal of many cannot make up for illiteracy, non-possession of the Scriptures, or inability to understand them by reading even when they are obtained. In the villages the percentage of illiteracy is very high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Many Africans are giving themselves to the Lord more readily than ever before and the very persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses has caused them to be regarded with greater favor and sympathy by others. There are evidences to show that even the efforts of certain police to bribe African tribal elders to trap some of the witnesses into lending them a book, to produce evidence suitable for a prosecution, have met with little success and this sort of thing has engendered the disgust which such action deserves. In Lusaka an African suffers two months’ imprisonment for possessing even one Watch Tower publication, whereas in Livingstone the same offense is punished with two weeks’ imprisonment; but God is not the author of this confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Several people, including government officials, have manifested considerable kindness to the witnesses, and their actions indicate that while they do not agree with our work they at least appreciate the sincerity of those who share in it. One district commissioner, in fact, paid two witnesses 5/-each as a compensation for having been wrongfully detained in prison by his predecessor, and another well-placed official met his houseboy, who had been imprisoned for possessing our literature, with his car when his sentence had expired, and took him back to work! While this is true, there is a deep-seated fear in the minds of many Europeans who appreciate our message, because they feel that if they make this known openly or actively their positions will be jeopardized ; but faith grows by acts of faith, and the Searcher of all hearts will quicken and strengthen his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Regardless of the obstacles which may be put in the way in the future, the witness will continue, and witnessing here, at best, means considerable hardship to those who walk hundreds of miles on foot, mostly without shoes, through hot, bushy country, sometimes without water, or, in the times of rain, through rivers which require them to wade through waist deep, carrying their few things with them, or, if more fortunate, using a cycle to make the journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The fulfillment of prophecy and the constant revelation of truth has caused those fully associated with us to be calm and confident; more fully grounded in the Kingdom message than ever before; sure of the divine direction of The Theocracy and the approaching destruction of dictatorship and all evil. This, then, is the victory, even our faith: a faith grounded in the promises of Jehovah, through Christ; quickened by the guidance and direction from the Temple and stimulated by the knowledge that we are not alone, but a small unit in the greater army of the Lord, sharing in singing the New Song, that song which will continue to increase in volume, despite all that would still it, until its sound is itself lost in the final witness of God Himself in the Armageddon conflict, and the triumph of righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This part of the continent, which at one time was known as “darkest Africa”, continues to follow a more enlightened and progressive policy towards Jehovah’s witnesses than the neighboring territories. There is no general ban on importation and distribution of the Kingdom literature, and, accordingly, the Kingdom publishers have been able to carry forward their work without serious interference. There are now 117 company organizations, to compare with 98 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a year ago. There</span><span class="font5"> has been a monthly average of 8 pioneers and 1,965 company publishers, to compare with a total of 1,548 publishers last year. They have averaged 30 hours per month in field service, and placed 3,129 volumes and 39,516 booklets. The back-calls numbered 140,181, which represents an increase of 43,737; and the sound attendance, 100,850. The total attendance at the Memorial was 2,644, of which number 17 partook of the emblems. The depot servant in his report states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Kingdom literature has not been as plentiful as in previous years, but this has in no wise caused any concern; for the ‘final showdown’, we know, is well on the way. Zone servants have once again put in some really good work, and today the majority of companies are in a condition which should enable them to carry forward their duties with no or very little extra help. Associated with the 2,878 publishers in this country are approximately 5,500 friends who attend the regular model and book studies arranged. During the month of June 92 of these friends took their stand as publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom; among them are a number of young folk—children of Jehovah’s witnesses taking their stand. Their worldly-wise friends are much astounded to hear them answering Bible questions which they themselves find ‘mysteries’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There have been one or two interesting incidents during this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One of the sisters, the wife of a pastor of one of the religious organizations, was brought up before the native court charged by her husband ‘for being a Jehovah’s witness’. ‘She is troubling me’, complained the pastor. ‘She will not obey me when I tell her to stop calling on the people with these books.’ Court (to sister) : ‘Why don’t you obey your husband?’ Sister: ‘In my duties as a wife to him I do, but in the matter he accuses me of I cannot. I must obey the Lord.’ After some more palaver the court decided to ‘fine’ the sister 6/- for being a Jehovah’s witness. She refused to pay the fine, but her eldest child, who was near by, was rather upset over the matter, and so, unobserved, he made his way to his father’s house, took from his father’s pocket 6/-, and came back and handed it over to the court. When the father learned where the money had come from he was furious! It is a standing joke among the friends to this day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On another occasion a couple of young men, urged on by a deacon, snatched some books away from some sisters as they were taking part in a service effort arranged by one of the zone servants. Late that evening the brethren who were having an impromptu meeting beheld the young men hurrying along to them with the books in their hands. (They had heard that their snatching of books had been reported to the chief and that they were due to be called up before the court on the morrow.) The brethren refused to accept back the books. ‘You can give them back to us at the court tomorrow where we have reported the matter,’ they said. At the hearing the next day the old chief said: ‘For a long time I was deceived by people who came to me reporting that Jehovah’s witnesses are adulterers and troublemakers among the people. I believed those reports until I attended some of their studies. I find them to be orderly people, and if anyone troubles them again after this I will see to it that such person is severely punished.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “evil servant” class continue on their way down to the “Dead sea”; and anything they can do to keep the peo-pie from reading of the Theocratic truths and from associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, they do it. Their favorite is the doctrine of fear—supported, of course, by a pack of lies. So much for “civilized religions”. “Uncivilized religions” still entrap many. The Devil cooks up any belief: Some keep the graves of the dead clean of grass and weeds; for they believe that if they don’t the “spirits of the dead will come forth and put a curse upon them”. Others believe that when a man dies his “spirit” finds a home in one of the wild animals. Then there are the “devil-dancers”, who smear their bodies with various hues in ocher and, dressed in costumes of grass, go forth at dead of night to chant and dance round huge fires made upon the hilltops. Polygamy, too, keeps many from standing for The Theocracy. Yet a number of them are persons of good-will. Once one of them attended a funeral over which a pastor hovered. Said the pastor: “Friends, this person who has died is now with the Lord in heaven.” The polygamist friend got up and said: “You do not speak the truth. That person is in the grave, and when Armageddon comes that is where we will all go, and stay too, if we fail to stand for Jehovah’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For that kingdom we stand, and hope, by the Lord’s grace, to maintain our integrity toward the great Theocrat come what may. May His sustaining hand be with us all in the days ahead as it has been with our brethren in other countries in their trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “gospel of the Kingdom” continues to go out in Portuguese East Africa. Interest in the message has increased and a new peak of 70 publishers was attained. These friends have devoted 11,025 hours to the field service and 993 back-calls were made. There have been 668 model and book studies conducted, with a total attendance of 6,504.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tanganyika</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several isolated letters have come to hand from this country indicating that 158 brethren have had a share in the work of witness during the year. No other details are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now 11 publishers in St. Helena. Reports these days are irregular and thus far those received cover only a period of 10 months. Letters indicate the brethren there are still active. During the 10 months they spent 419 hours in field service and placed 13 volumes and 270 booklets. The sound attendance was 1,000; and the back-calls, 113.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been much to do during the past year, but as “willing volunteers” we have gladly given of our best to promote the interest of Jehovah’s kingdom. The brethren serving here continue to appreciate the fact that there is no greater privilege than to have a small share under the Lord’s direction in the organization of His work on earth. The mail handled has considerably increased. Letters received numbered 9,989; and those sent out, 10,307. Local </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font5"> and circular letters totaled 9,256. The ban on the importation of our American magazines seriously affected the number of new subscriptions, but we entered 762 new and 612 renewal subscriptions for our local journals. The paper shortage, which is becoming acute, makes it difficult for us to do as much as we would wish in this direction. All together. our little pnntery turned out 850,433 pieces during the year, consisting of 728,565 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font5"> publicmeeting and other leaflets, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informants,</span><span class="font5"> and office stationery; 91,968 journals; 22,000 copies of a 64-page booklet; 7,000 copies of a Model Study booklet, and 900 calendars. The brother who formerly served at the dispatch desk has been off sick for the greater part of the year, but, as there has been less to do in that part of the work, we have managed to get along with one less. In all, 1,437 cartons were sent out by rail, 5,227 parcels by book post, and 18,290 single copies of the journals. In addition to our office duties we have averaged 36 hours each per month in the field, which is an improvement on last year’s figure, and 12 back-calls. The full report is as follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In addition, brethren serving here act as study conductors at “Food Convenient” studies each week. All of us were privileged to attend the Johannesburg Convention, and the brethren serving here are grateful to the Society for the arrangements made in that connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The news of the passing of Brother Rutherford came as a shock to the friends in this part of the earth, as we had not heard that he was seriously ill. The fact that he has gone from the scene of his earthly labors is the proof that his work on earth is done. His works will follow him. There was no interruption in the work here. We have learned from the Lord that no man on earth is our leader, and we knew that He would make the necessary provision. We rejoice with Brother Knorr in his appointment and take this opportunity of assuring him of our hearty co-operation in caring for the Theocratic interests in this part of the earth. Our one desire is to ‘strengthen his hands in the Lord’. Already there is evidence that the “finest of the wheat” and “the best wine” have been kept to the very last! We have been greatly strengthened and refreshed as a result of the gracious and bountiful provision made for our needs throughout the year. There have been many times when we wondered where our next meal would come from, but at all times our confidence was that “in one way or another the Lord will provide”, and, true to the promise, “bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure,” we have never gone hungry. The provision of “food convenient” has been nothing short of miraculous. Time and again it has come to us like “manna from heaven”. The miracle of “the loaves and fishes” is performed in these modern days on an even greater scale and the entire multitude is well fed. What an encouragement and incentive it has all been to do our part in “the final gathering” and thus share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark142"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Here is another British possession that has ordered a ban on the Society’s publications’ coming into the territory ; and this has been in effect for a good many years. Only publications approved by the government are admitted. No longer is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine allowed in Trinidad. The governor has been a little lenient this past year in allowing the brethren to do some local printing, and they continue to assemble. The work is on the increase. The Branch servant reports 234 publishers engaging in the field work, to compare with 199 during last year, and these brethren placed 12,940 pieces of literature; which is an increase of nearly 5,000 pieces over the previous year. The activity in the field has increased as to hours and back-calls, but there is much room for improvement in their back-call activity. They made only 967 back-calls. This work is being stressed by the Branch servant, and we look forward to the coming year wherein more people will be assisted. The Branch servant’s report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is undoubtedly distress of nations with perplexity, and in these islands shortage of food such as we have never had before; yet Jehovah’s witnesses go joyfully on in His work, warning the people of the greater trouble ahead and also telling them the good news of his kingdom which will fulfill the desire of all for peace and happiness, without sickness, suffering or any other distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has also been and still is an insufficiency of the Society’s literature, and this has hampered the work even here in Trinidad, where a good increase over last year is shown. Jehovah has provided the literature, but men obstruct. No wonder their affairs are in such a mess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year four conventions were held: one at St. George, in the island of Barbados, at which 268 were in attendance ; three at Trinidad, the first at the city of San Fernando early in January, with 361 present. A convention early each calendar year has become a kind of institution here. For some time we used to have it regularly each New Year’s day. Weather conditions here are usually at their most pleasant phase during that month. The second was at Tunapuna, in the month of June. This place is more easily accessible, at which there were 400, 35 of whom, who had recently consecrated themselves to Jehovah to do His will, were baptized by immersion in the waters of a river. The third, September 20, in line with that at Cleveland, Ohio, and elsewhere. This was held at Princes Town. There were transportation difficulties and the theater was not spacious. Attendance was 371. We were provided with some of the speeches identical with those at Cleveland, and, on the whole, had a very enjoyable day. The same at all the other conventions. Of course, the principal item of each was field service. During that September 20 a police inspector drove up and confiscated records from a brother who with an electrical transcription machine installed in a motorcar was delivering the message, the Society’s publications, as you know, being banned by a local law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As it seems almost impossible to get shipping space for sending supplies to us, the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font5"> one of the few allowed by the local government, has been printed locally. We got some in time for the convention, and it is going out nicely. It is like relief from famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the island of Barbados, recently, an elected member of the government there, in a speech at a regular meeting of the House, made, among others, the following remarks regarding the censorship: “I cannot help feeling that the smaller the community is, the more seriously people take themselves; that is at the bottom of some of this censorship.” “If laws are so stupid as to earn the contempt of citizens, then the citizens must as a matter of ultimate right break those laws.” “And the censorship that has been objected to has been objected to on those grounds. This is mainly a political objection, but religious literature has been banned in this island.” “The publications of Jehovah’s witnesses have been banned in this island, and why, Jehovah alone know’s.” “The Bible has been banned in the West Coast of Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. . It would not do for the native to think that he is the equal of the commissioner; and if the Bible says he is, it must not get into his hands.” The speaker was the reverse of complimentary regarding what he said that we teach, but sees clearly that we are mistreated, and used our case to show how wrongly his government is conducting itself by banning literature that is in no way subversive. We know, however, that its action is at the instigation of the clergy, who cannot stand up to Bible truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the results so far of the public meeting held here protesting against the ban on the Society’s publications is that the Colonial Office, London, has decided that the question of lifting the ban will be brought up for further consideration at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It can also be seen that units of the “great multitude” are showing interest and associating themselves with Jehovah’s organization, and that He permits nothing but that works together for the good of those who love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Branch at Trinidad also directs the work in many of the near-by islands, including Grenada, of the British West Indies. There are twelve publishers pushing ahead with the field activity, placing 908 pieces of literature during the last year and reporting 25 back-calls. Much more literature could have been placed by these publishers if they had had it on hand; but there is no more available. With the new publication printed locally, namely, the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font6"> probably the activity in Grenada can be improved by placing this booklet and then making back-calls and beginning studies in it. All the brethren in this part of the world have had a blessed time and are desirous of holding high the banner of the Lord and continuing to fight in the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The rulers of this world may ban the work, take away all the literature, close the ports to importation of more literature, seize property, and set forth a decree that one may not have any of the Watch Tower literature in his possession, but even such decrees of men or governments cannot take away the inestimable privilege of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom from those who are in a covenant with God. Even letters from the Society very seldom reach West Africa, but somehow, at very belated dates, the “meat in due season” reaches them and the brethren are comforted. They have nothing in the way of literature, but they do have the Word of God in their mouths and this they proclaim. It is reported that some of the religionists who claim to believe the Bible say that the natives of West Africa should not have the Bible because the Bible show’s that the natives of that land have equal rights with God as have the white men, and this information religionists want to keep from the colored man in order to keep him in subjection. Still they claim to be Christians, but for commercial reasons only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Branch servant in West Africa has looked well to the interests of the Kingdom and has, under great difficulties, been able to visit many of the Lord’s people throughout this territory, and the report will show that zealous our brethren have been in ‘not forsaking the assembling of themselves together’ and continuing to preach the gospel. Their good works can be seen in that during the year 800 newly interested persons symbolized their consecration by water immersion. Many are seeking the Lord and looking to His organization for truth and are being taught by these faithful ministers of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has granted us the inestimable privilege of continuing with the work of giving witness of his Kingdom, and we are grateful and joyful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With zeal peculiar to the house of Jehovah, the brethren have gone throughout the land with the message of truth and helped people of good-will to see and appreciate that the Kingdom of God is their only hope. During the fiscal year just ending the response has been marvelous and, consequently, the numbers of people attending our Bible-study meetings in various places have greatly increased. The interested ones in towns and villages have been strengthened by the brethren who make back-calls and arrange for model studies, and the fruit of such work of love is seen in the number of those who have symbolized their consecration by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions and Baptism</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many conventions were held during the year, and many who have “come out of Babylon” have seized the opportunity to openly declare their consecration by baptism. In many cases the brethren traveled from 60 to 100 miles on foot, to be able to attend the conventions, without regretting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In November 1941 a convention was held in Aba, in which over 1,000 brethren were present and 147 persons were immersed. In December 1941 brethren above 500 assembled in another convention at Ilesha, when some 80 persons were baptized. Around the last Memorial period we arranged for one-day conventions, which were held in all important centers all over Nigeria. Reports from the centers showed a total of 150 persons baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In July the Lord made it possible for us to receive information about the conventions to be held in America and England in the month of September, and we quickly decided to hold some in Nigeria at the same time; and we sent information about them to the brethren in Gold Coast and Sierra Leone. Accordingly, on September 19 and 20 three conventions were held simultaneously at Aba, Abeokuta and Ilesha. At Aba 950 were present and 183 immersed. At Abeokuta 1,076 were present and 83 baptized. At Ilesha 450 assembled and 108 were immersed. The total number of those present at the conventions was 2,476, and the total number of those who received baptism was 374. We sent the following greetings by cable to America and England: “President Watchtower Society, Brooklyn, N.Y. Conventioners over 2,000 strong assembled Nigeria. Greetings, conventioners America. [Signed] William Brown.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In reply we received the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) “William Brown, 71 Broad Street, Lagos. Countrywide New World Assembly Jehovah’s victory. Send greetings and love. Determined to go ahead with you in Kingdom service. [Signed] Nathan H. Knorr.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) “Watchtower Society, 71 Broad Street, Lagos. Greetings very welcome to London conventioners. 2,100 here heartily reciprocate. Eight other conventions join us in greetings. [Signed] Hemery.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">By these conventions the Lord has greatly blessed and strengthened us, and though we are anxiously waiting for that blessed time mentioned in Revelation 21: 4, 5, yet we are arranging for more conventions to be held within a few months to come, if it so pleases the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The celebration of the Memorial fell on March 31 this year; but as we no longer receive either the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine or the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> containing information about the date, we had to request Brooklyn office by cable for the proper date. Immediately we received it we communicated the information by telegrams and letters to the central companies. Not all, however, received the information in time, and eventually did not celebrate the Memorial, but those who celebrated it and reported were 1,181, out of whom 19 partook of the emblems. The nourishing food on the subject which the Lord had previously given to us was dished afresh and enjoyed before the celebration, and the Jonadabs (including those who recently came into Jehovah’s organization) rejoiced to know their position and relationship to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of all hardship the brethren have shown determination to continue working to the end of demon rule. It appears the authorities have used the international conditions to sever us from the head office. For some eight months we received no letters from Brooklyn though wc wrote several letters to which replies were sent but were not delivered to us. The Branch servant has not been permitted to travel with his car outside the colony of Lagos. The cost of Government and other transports has been increased by over 100 percent. Apart from the railway there is no other regular and reliable means of transport; and it is a risk to travel far, as there are possibilities of being left in the lurch on the road for either shortage of petrol or breakage not easily overcome. In spite of such inconveniences the Branch servant traveled the length and breadth of the country to strengthen and encourage the brethren. He visited during the year the following centers, starting from Lagos: Abeokuta, 64 miles; Ibadan, 120 miles; Ilesha, 206 miles; Benin, 354 miles; Warri, 417 miles; Aba, 525 miles; Calabar, 600 miles; Port Harcourt, 500 miles; and many other villages. The total number of miles he traveled during the year was over 2,000. In addition, two special publishers were sent out by this office to go around among the companies and assist the brethren where necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because Jehovah’s witnesses are not ignorant of the schemes of Satan to destroy them they have therefore not permitted anything to hinder them from faithful performance of their assigned duties to The Theocracy. Brethren have been arraigned in court for being in possession of Bible literature, found guilty, and imprisoned. There are similar cases still pending in a court. In one place brethren were haled before a native chief and accused of preaching against religion and of being neutral in the affairs of this world, but the accusation did not impress the chief as did the refusal of the witnesses to prostrate before him, and for which offense he unlawfully kept some 20 witnesses in his custody, making no adequate provision for their food. Even a district officer believed unfounded charge of disturbing religion, and unlawfully detained the Lord’s people in prison for two weeks. Thus we see how “the king of the north” is stretching forth his hand in Nigeria. If Jehovah God bad not been protecting his people here our services would have been completely stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to war measures, it has not been possible to hear regularly from our brethren in Gold Coast and Sierra Leone, but from letters that came through we know the faithful ones in those places are doing their best to magnify the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have been some placements of books and booklets by the publishers on the Gold Coast, some of whom have been thrown into jail. The same thing applies to the phonograph lectures. Certainly the monstrosity can stop the work but cannot stop the witnesses as long as they have breath. —Ps. 150 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of brethren who reported their activities during the year is 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total number of hours spent in witness work, 198,546.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total number of back-calls made, 4,668.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Total number of company organizations in country, 118. Total number immersed during the year is over 800.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Another year in the fight for the New World finds the servants of the Most High standing firm and offering all the fruitage of their labors unto the Lord. Nowhere in all the world have the servants of the Most High put forth active efforts for any selfish gain. If they are in this work for any gain, what is the gain? The apostle Paul propounded this question: “What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law; to the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.” (1 Cor. 9:18-23) It was because of Paul’s love for the gospel that he preached and gave everything he had in the interests of the Kingdom. It was in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and for the gospel’s sake that he witnessed to bond and free, Jew and gentile, weak and strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why did he do all this labor without any personal gain ? So that he would be a partaker in the Kingdom. It was his love of Christ, and there was nothing that could separate him from this love. In his argument he points out that he had started the race for the Kingdom and he was determined to finish it, “not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”—! Cor. 9: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the very attitude of the servants of the Lord in all parts of the earth. They have started in the work and, by the Lord’s grace, and with His help and tender mercy, they will continue to preach this gospel and none want it said that “when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway”. They have taken on this glorious privilege of representing the only true God, and this work they will continue to do and ultimately defeat persecutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This past year’s report shows that Jehovah’s witnesses, who are the servants of the Most High, are not going to stop something that they have started at Jehovah’s command, but rather this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached unto all the world for a witness. Even though they have no books, no magazines, no booklets, no pamphlets, or not even the Bible, in some instances, they realize that there is work to be done, and, with God’s help and under His direction, knowing that Christ Jesus is in the temple, they will follow the Lord’s leading and preach unto all nations unto the end, 'until the houses be without inhabitants and the cities destroyed’. If the time does come that the brethren no longer have any literature they will have the word of God in their mouths and they will continue to be publishers for the Kingdom, they will put in hours of service, and they will make calls on those of good-will in the territory in which they reside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The combined report for 1942, though incomplete, due to lack of communications, is a blessed one and will bring real courage to those who have shared in this work and to those who are now taking their stand; for it shows that throughout all the world there are now upward of 106,000 publishers reporting as engaging in the work. All Theocratic publishers are witnessing. Of these 106,000 publishers there are, throughout the world, 7,624 pioneers putting in their full time, and these have received the Lord’s rich favor. In years past we have always tabulated the amount of literature placed in the hands of the people, and this tabulation is made again to show the tremendous work that has been accomplished; but even more than this is the preaching of the gospel which is shown by the number of hours put in in the field and of the back-calls made. Throughout all the world, the annual report shows 28,030,049 hours were devoted by these faithful publishers of the Kingdom in magnifying Jehovah’s name and comforting those that mourn. From one end of the earth to the other these faithful servants of Jehovah, His witnesses, continue to call on the people who are seeking meekness and righteousness, and during the year they made 6,707,204 back-calls on interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Undoubtedly in the year to come, by the Lord’s grace and under His supervision, a greater witness will be accomplished; for even more persons will take their stand on the side of the Lord and for his Kingdom and will be publishers. They will devote more time in the interests of the Kingdom and make more back-calls on those who are seeking after truth and righteousness. These publishers will work with such literature as they have, primarily the Bible and the books and booklets that the Lord provides through His organization. During the past fiscal year it has been the good pleasure of these servants to place in the hands of the people 24,686,850 books and booklets, in addition to 8,725,938 magazines which were placed in their street witnessing work and on routes. This brings the total of books (including Bibles) and booklets distributed by the Theocratic publishers since 1920 up to 398,466,765 copies. We may expect that the distribution of books and magazines will be on the decline in the coming year, but there should be no decline in the number of publishers, and of hours devoted to witnessing, and in the calling by these publishers on the people of good-will. Companies should grow. New organizations should be started. Already throughout the world, according to the annual report (which is very incomplete), there are 5,232 groups meeting together; and these we call companies. All are following organization instructions and, even though they cannot communicate with any branch office or the head office because the lands in which they live are totalitarian in government, they know that they are the servants and witnesses of the Most High and the Lord will reveal unto them His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this shows the unity and determination on the part of the servants of God to stand firm regardless of scattering that takes place. The apostle, in Acts 8:4, says, “Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.” Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be stopped. They have their commission, they are ambassadors of the King and the representatives of the Kingdom in this dark world, and therefore they continue to preach, come what may. It is a joy to read the reports from the various parts of the earth, all bringing out the faithfulness, the determination, the zeal, and the same spirit manifested in faithful servants of the Most High down through the years. Whether they be located in cold northern countries, or in the nations along the equator, or in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere, no matter where they be, there they serve the Lord. This organization Jehovah has formed, and he has formed it for His purpose and it will bring glory to His name. The Devil hates Jehovah’s witnesses and he is out to get them, but in all parts of this wicked world of the Devil this wicked one will be proved a liar and it will be proved definitely that Jehovah can place on this earth creatures that will maintain their integrity under stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By his wily propaganda and bitter oppression and persecution of Jehovah’s servants, and by many hardships brought upon the people all over the earth to cause all creatures to turn against Jehovah, Satan attempts to discourage and restrain Jehovah’s covenant people, but the Lord’s chosen ones rely solely upon Him. Jehovah’s witnesses do not permit themselves to be disturbed by wicked men, nor do they fret because</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of evildoers, but ‘those who do know their God do exploits’ (Ps. 37:1-5; Dan. 11:32); they know their job is to bear faithful witness to the Kingdom, and this they do, not losing sight of the great issue. Today it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">everything for the issue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No matter if they be in large congregations or isolated, in democratic or in totalitarian-ruled countries, in the islands of the seas, in the darkest places of Africa, by His grace and mercy the children of God will be wise and will make the heart of Jehovah God glad by faithfulness and blamelessness, and He will have an answer for the Devil, who reproaches Him. (Prov. 27:11) Like Job and the prophets, like the apostles and the faithful disciples, the present-day Jehovah’s witnesses will stand firm and will defeat persecution. Great is their privilege in sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name!</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>REPORT OF MEETINGS OF THE ASSOCIATIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">On January 13, 1942, a special meeting was called of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (Pennsylvania corporation) and the board of directors of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. (New York corporation). A joint meeting was held at Brooklyn, New York, for the election of a president. The boards of directors were notified of the passing of Brother J. F. Rutherford as president, January 8, 1942, and the purpose of this meeting was to fill this vacancy. The joint boards unanimously elected Nathan H. Knorr as president of both corporations. This caused a vacancy in the office of vice-president, whereupon Hayden C. Covington was unanimously elected as vice-president of the two corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Tuesday, January 27, 1942, a meeting of the council of the International Bible Students Association (British corporation) was called. The board of directors was informed that J. F. Rutherford died on the 8th, at San Diego, California. From the minutes of this meeting of the board of directors, held in London, England, the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Resolved that this meeting of the board of directors of the International Bible Students Association conforms to that of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn; and that Brother Nathan H. Knorr be, and is hereby elected president of the International Bible Students Association and a member of the council.” The resolution was confirmed by all the directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On October 1, 1942, the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The regular order of business was transacted. The officers present at this meeting were the president, the vice-president, and the secretary-treasurer. At the close of the business meeting the following declaration was offered and unanimously accepted, and request was made that publication of this declaration be made in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1943 Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font6"> along with the president’s report on the Society. The declaration is herewith set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Declaration</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the Pennsylvania corporation, on October 1, 1942, held in Pittsburgh, Pa., pursuant to the charter and the by-laws of the corporation, a motion was made and seconded and on submission was unanimously voted by all present, to wit, that a declaration be recorded in the minutes of the corporation and published in the annual report to this effect, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, duly assembled as legal representatives of our brethren throughout the world, declare:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) That the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is the servant to the earthly part of Jehovah’s capital organization on earth, whether legally recognized according to the laws of any land or not;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) That, since the laws of the State of Pennsylvania require that the corporation have officers and directors the same as any other corporation, it is recognized that vacancies in any office must be filled in the manner required by law;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) That Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus are the Leaders and invisible Directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and that Jehovah through his Son places his servants in the earthly part of his organization as well as in the invisible heavenly part thereof, as it pleases him, the great Theocrat;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(4) That for more than sixty years Jehovah has used faithful men, C. T. Russell and J. F. Rutherford, as his servants to fill the office of president, the chief executive office of the Society, to oversee the affairs of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization under direction from the Lord;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(5) All faithful servants of the Lord have recognized that The Theocracy, of which the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is a servant, operates from the Top down, and not from the bottom up as in the worldly governments, and, therefore, that instructions come to the Lord’s people on earth from the office of president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, filled by anointed men chosen of the Lord in his organization;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(6) We recognize before the Lord that Brother N. H. Knorr is His chosen servant to fill the office of president vacated by the passing on of Brother J. F. Rutherford to a higher office and field of service in Jehovah’s organization; and that with this change in personnel in office the organization has not changed one bit, but that it has continued forward with greater speed and increase than ever before known in the history of God’s earthly organization. We look forward with great delight and keen anticipation to greater blessings through the organization than ever before, while the present president fills the office, by an unlimited ‘running in’ of the “other sheep”, and a literal fulfillment of Isaiah 9: 7 and of Isaiah 54: 2, which read: “Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.” “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.” We have seen much evidence of the beginning of this increase since the New World Theocratic Assembly in September, 1942, which appears to begin a new chapter in the history of the organization on earth;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(7) We declare to all our brethren throughout the earth that we are one hundred percent, wholeheartedly and joyfully behind the present president in every step that he takes in attempting to carry out the privileges and great responsibilities of his office, in an effort to serve Jehovah; and we rejoice in the privilege of continuing to march with him clear through the glorious portals of the New World to complete victory in this great fight for The Theocracy. We pray the continued increase of the Lord’s rich blessing upon the office of the president of the Society, and upon all the brethren at Bethel and elsewhere throughout the earth, who are holding high the banner of truth in the battle against demonism.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“More than conquerors through him that loved us.&quot;—Rom. 8:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No devoted Christian who studies and puts faith in the indestructible Word of God will let himself be deceived by the fair promises of worldly rulers concerning a “New World order” in which the freedom of religion will be guaranteed and impartially enforced. Such will never mean a cessation of persecution and suffering for those who keep themselves unspotted from the world and who faithfully follow the example of Christ Jesus and bear witness to the kingdom of God established in A.D. 1914. God's Word, which is the truth, plainly declares that the afflictions, and that at the hand of religionists, will continue and increase upon his faithful servants and will extend into the postwar international arrangement. Why? Because these now refuse and will steadfastly keep on refusing to idolize and serve that anti-Jehovah organization of man under demon control and will continue to obey God rather than men and to publish His name and His Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus as the only rightful rule of the earth and the sole hope of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almighty God permits this final test upon his consecrated remnant and their companions that thereby Satan, the god of the proposed “new </span><span class="font5">229 </span><span class="font8">order”, may have a last chance to prove himself able to fulfill his proud boast of turning all creatures away from Jehovah God. To the remnant and their companions is given the unusual privilege of delivering the final answer proving the Devil a self-conceited liar and God the plain Truthteller. As long as these faithful servants of Jehovah God continue following in the steps of his faithful Son, nothing that Satan brings upon them in the way of hardship, privation and violent persecution can break the love which Christ Jesus has for these faithful ones nor separate them from the expression of his love toward them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not in their own strength can the remnant and their companions conquer and bring to nought the wicked purposes of Satan in his merciless persecution and opposition. Their overcoming must be and can be only by and through him who loves them, Christ Jesus, because he also was tried and tested to the limit and he overcame the world and is able to bring them also off as victors over the world gone totalitarian. Through Christ Jesus Jehovah has implanted in the hearts of the remnant and their companions the unbreakable love of righteousness, the crowning point of which righteousness is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus the King. By closely following his example as Jehovah’s “Faithful and True Witness” and advancing whithersoever he leads them through his Theocratic organization, they can and will overcome Satan’s wicked designs and efforts and will prove the sufferings he thrusts upon them in vain and a complete failure. Nay, in all such sufferings they more than overcome. In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They overcome or conquer by not allowing such afflictions to offend them against God, so turning them away from him in revolt. They endure these things and feel inward joy that they are counted worthy to bear such for His name’s sake. They also beat back the enemy assaults and yield them no ground, by God’s grace and power through Christ Jesus. But more than this, they carry on an offensive warfare against the adversaries, the demons and religion. Nothing stops them in their aggressive action in carrying forward in the “strange work” of the Most High God. The Lord blesses their faithful efforts through Christ Jesus; he protects and sustains them, and finishes his work through them as individuals and collectively. Thereby he crowns their courageous and unslacking activities with victoby. So he makes them “more than conquerors” through his Son, who loves them. They not only hold the Kingdom interests committed to them, but more than overcome by boldly increasing those interests in the face of the enemies’ fire. They push the enemies out of the field of worship on which these have encroached, and they aid all persons of good-will to flee to the side of Jehovah God and his Theocracy before almighty power blots out the enemies at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So continuing, the triumphant remnant and their companions keep themselves unseparated from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, and they have a joyful part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Tribulation and persecution will increase till Armageddon stops such, and much opportunity will therefore yet be given God’s devoted ones to prove themselves daily “more than conquerors” and finally such.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.—Mic. 4:7, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah now there reigns by his anointed King whom He enthroned as Rightful Ruler of the new world in 1914. By him Jehovah will reign in his official residence of Mount Zion “from henceforth even for ever”. Hence the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, as “the feet of Him”, are the company that “bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!” (Isa. 52:7) They submit to Jehovah and his kingdom Representative as “the Higher Powers”, obeying them rather than the opposing men, and they thankfully accept and diligently seek to increase the Kingdom interests on earth committed to them. They know it is not discretionary, but mandatory, upon them to ‘fear God. honour the King’, and preach this gospel. (1 Pet. 2:17) The remnant together with their companions continue to do this one thing, and will to the final end. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.—1 Pet. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That means that the judgment of the Lord first takes account with those covenanting to do God’s will, including both those in an expressed covenant and those in an implied covenant with Jehovah. It means the taking into account the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and the “evil servant” class, and all those who hold themselves out as the people of God and the followers of Christ Jesus. The judgments of the Lord must of necessity be announced and executed after the great Judge comes to his temple, because </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font6"> is the place of judgment. When the time comes to take account with his creatures Jehovah causes his law to be proclaimed. This becomes a witness for or against those who hear. Creatures themselves have much to do in putting themselves in position to receive the judgment of condemnation or the judgment of approval.

That time began with the incoming of the day of Jehovah in 1914, and the final end thereof will come at Armageddon. There the primary issue of universal domination will be settled once and for all time. The Theocracy will settle it right, which is, in favor of the great Theocrat, Jehovah, the Almighty God. That victory will be a vindication of God’s name and will mean deliverance and blessing to all creatures who live and who love righteousness and truth. Jehovah is the Supreme One and the only source of life, law and order. His Theocratic rule over all the universe, including this earth, is the only rightful rule.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Shall a nation [The Theocracy] be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.—Isa. 66:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus the King is the essential one of The Theocracy. He needs no associates with him to begin the Government born at God’s due time, in 1914, because He bought the Government and is entrusted with all power in heaven and earth. Only by the grace of God are his faithful followers, members of “the body of Christ”, associated with him in the Kingdom, and that first after his coming to the temple, when he raises the sleeping saints from death. The remnant on earth, judged and approved, he anoints and brings into the covenant of faithfulness for the Kingdom. Thus, after the tribulation of God’s organization came, those of the remnant were brought forth by Zion and acknowledged by Jehovah as his other “children” besides the “man child” Government born in 1914.—Rev. 12:1-5.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.—Mic. 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judgments of the Supreme Judge over all, as written in his Holy Word, Jehovah's faithful servants have obediently declared to all “Christendom&quot;, but the heads and rulers thereof abhor such judgments. Such prefer human judgments, and never was the earth filled with greater injustices and inequity. The climax of their abhorrence of judgment and perversion of equity comes when they will shortly succeed in everywhere ruling that Christian works of Jehovah’s covenant people are “illegal”, and then put them to silence under restraints forcibly. Then in all bad conscience they shall cry “Peace and safety!” and so mark themselves for sudden destruction at the hands of the God of justice, judgment and equity. God’s command now is to “hear this”. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land.—Mic. 5: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the great “Assyrian&quot; shall fail in his destructive program and since the “remnant” of Jehovah’s Kingdom heirs are the principal target of the “Assyrian”, Jehovah by his Good Shepherd will preserve the remnant of his “little flock” through the battle of Armageddon. They shall see the terrific destruction of the Assyrian forces down to the last creature thereof. This preservation is not that the remnant of spirit-begotten children of God may live on earth during the whole thousand-year reign of Christ that shall follow. Their stay after Armageddon is merely for a brief time, serving as a vindication of God’s promise and almighty power to preserve the faithful in their direst extremity. Along with them Jehovah preserves his “other sheep”. Satan shall fail in his all-out wicked endeavor to rid the earth of every righteous servant of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.—Rev. 13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who stand in awe and fear of Satan’s visible organization and serve it and who now proudly ask, Who is like this creature ? and who can fight against it ? are in for the strangest surprise. (Vs. 4) At various times God has permitted the enemy organization to apparently triumph over his covenant people upon whom his name is called. This he has allowed for a test of the integrity and devotion to Him of his name-people, and also that the religious enemy may show what is in their hearts and expose themselves as hating Jehovah and his Christ and his servants and witnesses. On this wise the enemy mark themselves as servants of the Devil and fit for destruction when Jehovah shows his power over Satan and over Babylon at Armageddon. Jehovah turns the tables upon his and his people’s enemies. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously.—Ex. 15:1, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1914 is the day of battle and war, beginning with the first “war in heaven” and culminating shortly in the universal war, Armageddon. Everlasting peace to the universe can never come until that battle has been fought and Jehovah of hosts again triumphs gloriously as he did at the Red sea. Those having faith in His sure victory may sing now. In fact, Jehovah, the great Composer of song and praise, long ago inspired songs to be written and reserved for this very day of battle and w<sup>T</sup>ar, and whieh songs must be sung by his singers now, before that final battle. The basic theme of all these songs is the same, namely, the vindication of Jehovah’s name by his Warrior nation, The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, and the vindication of his indisputable right to the domination of the universe. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that, being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed.—Prov. 29:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore let rulers and peoples be sure of this one thing: that as they put up resistance to the assembly of Jehovah’s people unto his Kingdom, they must expect to come upon them, with strange suddenness shortly, and without a loophole of escape, a catastrophe like ancient Egypt’s, but of such proportions as to make her beating very light in comparison. Jehovah God shall not be mocked without consequences. (Gal. 6:7) Those who engross themselves in the lofty-looking programs of men of the world mimic Pharaoh’s challenge, saying: “Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go?” All such will shortly find themselves hopelessly entrapped in a course that means their destruction. Those who act meekly and wisely and who join in and help others into the gathering to The Theocratic Government shall survive and go free. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But be seeking first the kingdom and its righteousness. —Matt. 6:33, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All religions, though fighting and differing among themselves, unite together in friendship with this world and in opposition to Jehovah’s Righteous Government under his anointed King. When religious organizations are curbed for meddling in the politics and public affairs of this world’s governments, that is not persecution for righteousness’ sake, but for busybodying. (1 Pet. 4:15) Only that which comes because of advocating and pointing people to Jehovah’s Government that vindicates His name is the persecution “for righteousness’ sake” and for the suffering of which the reward is great in heaven. Righteousness is the purpose of that Government. “A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom: thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee.”—Heb. 1:8,9.

<p><span class="font6">When politicians speak of world domination they think the issue is something just affecting this earth for whose surface they fight. The real issue is far more extensive, as vast as the universe and its inhahitation. The primary issue is universal domination. Therefore men and political organizations and their armies will not decide the issue, but the Almighty Ruler of the universe shall. They are all for continued man-rule on earth under religion, as opposed to the direct rule by Jehovah God through his King, Christ Jesus. The chief opponent of the Lord God in this universal issue is Satan the Devil. Those who are not on the side of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government under his Son must be on the side of Satan. No position of neutrality is guaranteed to any nation in this issue. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then the spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.-Judg. 11:29, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the spirit of Jehovah God that Jephthah needed as he took over the command of Israel’s armies and sent the challenge and warning notice to the king of Ammon who invaded Israel’s God-given land. The coming of the spirit upon the man proves that the battle at hand was the Lord God’s, and that Jephthah was approved of Him and was his choice and representative among His covenant people. This confirms that Jephthah was a man of faith and an approved witness for Jehovah, and not simply the choice of the elders of Gilead. Jehovah’s spirit is the invincible power unto victory. His spirit he puts upon those who devote themselves to his purposes and who offer themselves for service and seek to vindicate his name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">David, Go in peace.—1 Sam. 20:41,42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When, in the Lord’s due time, the last ones of the remnant complete the Lord’s work for them among the “other sheep”, then the remnant will cease to exist and the “body of Christ” will be fully made up in the invisible heavens. Those then left on the earth as the visible representatives of the divine Theocracy will be those men whom the King-Father makes “princes in all the earth”, namely, the faithful men of old including Jonathan, shortly to be raised from the dead in a “better resurrection”. In a relative comparison of numbers of the “other sheep” and the remnant, ‘the former must increase, but the latter must decrease.’ Thought of eventually parting bodily does not of itself give pleasure, for companionship between the remnant and the “other sheep” is very pleasant, like that between David and Jonathan. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The word of Jehovah that came to Micah theMorashtite in the days of . . . kings of Judah.—Mic. 1:1, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not the word of man, but the word of Jehovah God, and therefore the sure and safe guide to the one who has undertaken to serve Jehovah. It is the authoritative word of God that came to Micah and that comes to the people whom Micah foreshadowed and represented. The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Micah</span><span class="font6"> is an abbreviation of “Micaiah”, which name means “Who [is] like Jah?” After 1918 God’s people came to realize that the name of Jehovah is the all-important issue, and then they began to ask, as Micah asked, “Who is like Jah ?” The word “Jah” is an abbreviation of “Jehovah” and means the same thing. (Ps. 68: 4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font6"> God’s people now see there is none like Jehovah. Therefore they have set this question before all the world, and particularly have brought this question before “Christendom”, as being the main or chief issue now to be settled for ever. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">That was contrary to proved and tested military strategy of the world, but it is Jehovah’s way for his Theocratic people, who are not of this world but are in a covenant with him. It is the way of heavenly wisdom. Jerusalem’s gates swung open early in the morning, and with the temple Levite singers courageously to the fore the people marched forth, to witness Jehovah’s “strange act”. All marchers took up the song. Afar off the battle began. Jehovah’s invisible hosts must have enjoyed fighting against his enemies to the accompaniment of sacred song extolling the name of Jehovah, which name those enemies had reproached. That deliverance of his covenant people happened as a prophetic pattern, for the comfort of his people in the end of the world. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the final Judge, to whom all creatures and all organizations in the universe must render account for their comfort. He is the Supreme Power, excelling all. (Job 37:23) His devoted Son he has exalted to be next to Himself. To him He has delegated all power in heaven and earth, to act as his Deputy Judge in judging all nations and to execute the judicial decisions in righteousness. “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also.” (John 5:22,27) Hence Jehovah and his Son Christ Jesus are the true and only “Higher Powers”. All souls that are wise and lovers of life and righteousness will be subject to and will obey such “Higher Powers” rather than any other existing power in opposition.

<p><span class="font6">“Christendom’s” selfish worldly course proves she has no rights in the kingdom of God. She commits spiritual fornication with this world and is profane. She opposes and persecutes those who join the assembly unto God’s kingdom. Therefore she has gone in the way of Esau, who despised The Theocracy and sold away his claim on the birthright for a mess of pottage. There is therefore no hope of salvation by means of “Christendom” ; God’s judgment is upon her to destruction. Salvation is alone by his Kingdom, symbolized by Mount Zion. (Obadiah 21) The choice must now be made by all, whether to drift along with “Christendom” toward her proposed new order or to assemble to Jehovah’s glorious Mount Zion.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus showed himself no mere man’s witness, but God’s chief “Government witness”. As such he clearly marked out what is the primary thing to which to bear witness when he acknowledged on trial his appointment to be the King of the Government. Those who hear his voice and repeat what he says must therefore take up his witness and testify to the same Theocratic Government as he confessed; and which Government he refused to renounce under persecution to the death. Thereby these obedient and faithful witnesses become of the same class of “blessed” ones whom God mentions with honor in his Word, including those persecuted prophets of old and, chief of all, Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy.—Matt. 5:10-12.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus, at his baptism, being taken into the covenant by sacrifice and being thenceforth the spirit-begotten Son of God, he was in effect there slain as a man without human prospects for himself and was now dead to all such. His human sacrifice was prefigured by the Passover lamb slain down in Egypt. Being thereupon begotten to life as a spiritual Son, Jesus was then anointed with God’s spirit. That anointing was the designating and appointment of Jesus to be the Christ, the anointed King of the new world. He was the Chief One, the Fundamental One, the First and All-essential One, of the new world. There then was when the foundation of the new world was laid. Hence he is called “The Lamb slain from the foundation of the [new] world”.—Rev. 13:8. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 85 fl 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah knew his daughter was at home and might be the one, but he made his vow so sweeping as to cover and include her. Thereby he expressed the fullness of his devotion, the wholeheartedness of his desire, to see Jehovah’s cause triumphant, all for the vindication of God’s name and the maintenance of his typical Theocracy and the continuance of it to worship and serve Jehovah. Jephthah’s attitude was, Cost what it may, pay what I must, I shall be glad and willing for it to be so for the sake of the name of my God and his Theocratic rule over his people. That vow sets the pattern for the vow of Jehovah’s witnesses today and absolutely proves that they are unselfish, not seeking commercial profit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Great religionists claim to represent God, but instead of depending on God they have depended upon the strong military arm of this world, that is, the “chariots” and “horses”. In this they have shown a lack of faith in God, and because of fear of man the whole organization of “Christendom” has been brought into the snare of the Devil. The beginning of this sin of the professed “daughter of Zion”, “organized religion” so called, was the putting of faith in and depending upon the military and strong powers of this world for help, and thereby entirely departing from Jehovah God. (Mic. 1:13) Religionists attribute protection and salvation to things of this world. Jehovah’s servants stand out firmly against such sinful practice. With determination to not yield to the enemy, these faithful ones attribute all protection and salvation to God and boldly make such truth known.

The controversy is of vital interest and concern to the highest and the lowest personages of Satan’s visible organization and whose responsibility is greater because of power and influence. Instead of taking away freedom of speech, press and assembly in connection with Jehovah’s worship, “Christendom” should play fair and consider the everlasting welfare of her peoples and let them hear both sides of the controversy.

(1 Tim. 1:17) He will never leave his supreme estate, but it is his right and within his almighty power to determine who shall be next to Him and sit at his right hand. Such one He calls and makes his “heir”. Jehovah has appointed his beloved Son to this favored position. First, however, the Son must maintain the honor of his Father’s name by holding fast his integrity to God under the most crucial test from the enemy and by remaining “faithful unto death”.

Jehovah’s witnesses today are not under such restriction, but in view of the serious conditions now with us and which bespeak more terrible things shortly to come they do well to consider their course, whether it be well for them to follow Jeremiah’s course under like conditions in behalf of a full part in Jehovah’s “strange work” that ends at Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The “other sheep” disdain criticism and persecution, and associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and shoulder a goodly portion of the witness work and responsibilities. In this they must maintain their integrity, by constancy and faithfulness to their obligations and never permitting anything to entice and turn them away to the rudiments of the demonized dying world. Jehovah’s great High Priest brings these into the temple, where God’s face shines with favor and blessing upon them. (Rev. 7:15) The full-time service of the delightsome Theocracy is the dearest thing to their hearts. Those who during the day are obliged to do other work to provide things decent and required delight to go forth in His service at night and other times of the week and to use all possible of their waking hours in the direct service of The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s organization is the greater Bethlehem Ephratah, which name means “House of Bread with Fruitfulness”. God’s capital organization Zion is The House of Bread whereby God supplies abundantly the life-giving spiritual bread by Christ Jesus. Zion holds forth to the dying people the life-sustaining fruits or truth of God’s kingdom. “Judah” meaning “praise”, the “thousands of Judah” picture the “thousand thousands” of all the holy angels,- cherubim and seraphim in Jehovah’s universal organization who praise Him. Compared numerically with them, Jehovah’s capital organization Zion is “little”, exactly 144,000 and One. Though little, yet out of Zion comes forth unto Jehovah his “ruler in Israel”, whether Satan’s organization likes it or not. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The might and valor of Jehovah’s remnant in his “strange work”, which is destructive to religion, has been seen by all the nations, particularly “Christendom”, and they have been put to shame by such zeal for Jehovah. Religionists do not have the zeal that is peculiar to the Lord’s house and are forced to admit that fact. (Ps. 69: 9) “The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.” (Ps. 107: 42) Let this not be understood to mean, however, that the enemy have ceased to reproach Jehovah and to misrepresent, slander, falsely accuse, and taunt his faithful witnesses and their companions in service. In wild desperation the enemy indulge in that more viciously than ever. The Lord shall stop their wagging tongues in due time: “Their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.”—Zech. 14: 12.

<p><span class="font6">To test out their faithfulness under the discipline of persecution and deprivation of liberty Jehovah has often seemingly delayed, but never really so, the deliverance of his people from the enemy’s restraining power. The test is whether they will 'go down to Egypt for help’ and compromise with the enemy to secure a release, or relief, or a permit to witness, or immunity from violent attacks. The ones keeping their proper relationship to the Lord make no deals with the enemy, but continue to keep trust with and to obey God. Then their deliverance, when it comes, will be the Lord’s salvation and will prove Jehovah’s promise true. Keeping on working to the full use of all circumstances about them, they can afford to wait for his salvation, fully assured that it will come. Meantime they continue their fervent prayers to the great Savior, Jehovah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The number of things which He understands perfectly is as infinite as his universal creation, because he created all good things for his intelligent purposes. He is therefore the Lord and Master, the Supreme One. In contradiction of the Devil, who ordains himself to seek universal domination and who also ordains the political-religious organization on earth to seek “world domination”, the Lord God Jehovah has ordained himself and his Theocratic King, Christ Jesus, to be “The Higher Powers”. (Rom. 13:1-4) Jehovah’s ordination of power alone shall stand the supreme test. He says: “I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isa. 42:8, A.R.V.) His covenant people, therefore, place first importance upon Jehovah’s commands and obey him rather than worldly men. They hail Him as “great”.

<p><span class="font6">Those who hear and heed the Lord’s voice crying out through the world’s din see that the “rod” of his anger and indignation against “Christendom” is his Elect Servant, Christ Jesus. When Jehovah enthroned him as King in 1914 and proceeded to make Christ’s enemies his footstool, Jehovah then fulfilled His promise: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” Since Jehovah has appointed “the rod”, he will surely use it for his purpose. Chastisement cannot be escaped by the covenant-breakers even though “Christendom”, particularly her Roman Catholic Hierarchy, thinks and claims she has a “covenant with death” and is at “agreement with hell” and can escape correction. (Isa. 28:14-18) She will not survive her drubbing at Armageddon. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The psalmist David was a shepherd before becoming king of Israel, and he was one of the typical covenant people of Jehovah God. Both as a shepherd and as the first king of the typical Theocracy in Israel, David was a type of the Good Shepherd, who gave his life for his sheep, and who is made the “King of kings, and Lord of lords”. David anointed his obedient sheep with oil; and the Great Shepherd Jehovah anointed the One who is “the Lamb of God” with the oil of gladness above his fellows, and he is Jehovah’s anointed King, that is to say, Christ the King of The Theocratic Government. When David was anointed to be king the spirit of Jehovah came upon him; and the spirit of the Lord God is likewise upon Christ Jesus to be his Chief Witness, whose name is called “Faithful and True”.

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah’s girl pictured the Lord’s “other sheep”. They lined up unhesitatingly with the Theocratic organization of the Society under Christ Jesus, the Greater Jephthah. The big fight with religious totalitarians was impending. Since 1938 there has been a great ingathering of these “other sheep”. Now must come a great manifestation of these as to their stand. The questions must be answered: Who sees the great universal issue? Who sees the uncompromising stand of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization against totalitarianism? Who sees God is with his faithful remnant, approving their stand against demon rule as right and Scriptural? Who sees that The Theocracy and its worship of Jehovah are on the offensive and will continue clear through to victory over demonism? Jephthah’s daughter foreshadows the answer. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Why was the goat offered besides the bullock? To picture that Christ’s sacrifice does not stop with redeeming only those who become members of “his body”. The merit of his sacrifice avails for the Lord’s “other sheep” now being gathered into the Lord’s fold and also for their offspring who shall be brought forth after Armageddon under the Kingdom in fulfillment of the divine mandate. These “other sheep” do not sacrifice the right to earthly life but hope to live on earth as humans forever. Christ’s sacrifice also atones for the faithful men of old who will soon come to life by a “better resurrection” and be made The Theocracy’s visible representatives. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah did not crawfish nor yield any Theocratic ground. This is true today. Jehovah’s visible organization under Christ keeps on sending out his messengers with the same uncompromising message of Jehovah’s supremacy and kingdom. More interested persons are brought in, trained, and sent into the active service as publishers to help give a wider spread of the message. This is no activity interfering with the defense of democratic nations, but is a making of them more awake and alive to the real enemy and danger to their democratic principles. Jesus said: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” His followers are not inducing anyone to quit his worldly allegiance. Jehovah does the drawing of creatures to his organization. His witnesses merely give the testimony; God does the rest, and what he does is right and is irresistible. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Him who knew no sin, he made a sin-offering on our behalf, that we might become God’s righteousness in him.—2 Cor. 5:21, Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Genesis 6: 9 says that “Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations”. God commanded Abraham: “Walk before me, and be thou perfect.” (Gen. 17:1) God said that Job was a “perfect and an upright man”. (Job 1: 8; 2: 3) But the perfection in the sense there meant did not of itself entitle them to the right to perfect human life. Their receiving the right to life depends upon the sin-offering of Jesus applied in their behalf. This proves that Jesus had more than mere perfection of heart integrity as those faithful men had it. He had perfection of flesh, of human organism. Because of this he was able to provide the sin-offering. Fitness to be the sin-offering required his perfection in the flesh together with the right to human life in a perfect human body.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.—John 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What was the “world” that hated and persecuted Christ Jesus? Not the publicans, harlots, sinners and men of the street who came to Jesus; neither the “common people” with weaknesses inherited from sinner Adam, for “the common people heard him gladly”. (Matt. 11:19; 21: 31, 32; Mark 12:37) It was Satan the Devil and the demons of whom he is prince, and also the official element of Satan’s visible organization, particularly the priests and other religious clergy. Those religious leaders led the blinded people to cry, “Crucify him,” and, “We have no king but Caesar.” This proves beyond all contradiction that religion is not of God nor of Christ, and hence not righteous. It is demonism and is opposed to God and his Kingdom or Theocracy under Christ. Religion is therefore a part of this world and is the Devil’s chief instrument in persecution. History to date establishes that. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The invincible spirit of Jehovah is now and will ever be upon the Greater Isaiah, who is Christ Jesus the King of The Theocracy. The word of Jehovah concerning that Theocratic Government He has put in the mouth of Christ Jesus. That spirit and that word shall not depart from the remnant of Christ’s body nor from the companions of the remnant, the “other sheep”, “from henceforth and for ever.” Jehovah will have a remnant keeping covenant with him to the death; therefore he will never have cause to remove his spirit of power and his word of witness from them. Their companions will continue to march forward side by side with the remnant in indivisible unity, bearing their share of the work.

<p><span class="font6">The backbone of Satan’s organization is represented by the mountains, which stand out above the other parts of the ground. Jehovah is as a “consuming fire” to his enemies, which fire will quickly melt down the powers that now rule the nations. The great governments and rulers of the earth, likened to mountains, shall be split and valleys shall be cleft in them, destroying their adhesiveness, dividing and breaking their unity, and leaving them in ruin. Their leagues, treaties, alliances and confederacies will not hold. The figure of speech, “waters that are poured down a descent,” shows that when Jehovah begins execution of his judgments the earthly organizations will be dissolved quickly and melt away like a mountain torrent, which sweeps down everything in its path. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

They see that all governments under demon rule are doomed to early leveling to the ground. Hence they flee to God’s capital organization, his holy Mount Zion. They put themselves under it for protection and to be hid from Jehovah’s Executioner at the battle of Armageddon, “the Lamb.” Only thus doing may the “sheep” hope to live through that final and decisive battle between God’s organization and the Devil’s organization.

They wield that sword by proclaiming the truths of God’s Word to those with an car to hear. Thereby they waste the pastures of religion which the clergy part of “The Assyrian” have enjoyed with regard to such persons as now turn their ear to Bible truth. They take no part in the literal wasting of the demon rule and organization which is symbolized by “the land of Assyria”, “the land of Nimrod.” Jehovah’s Executioner does that. Now enthroned as King of the world and sent forth by Jehovah God to rule in the midst of his enemies, the great Shepherd-King takes the sword against the modern Assyria.

<p><span class="font6">Aaron foreshadowed Christ Jesus in the capacity of sacrificing High Priest of Jehovah God, whereas the “young bullock” for a sin-offering pictured “the body of Jesus Christ” as a perfect man. As such he was the exact equal of Adam in his perfection in Eden and possessed the right to life as a man on earth. Only thus could Jesus Christ have the wherewithal to present a sacrifice of sufficient value or merit to recapture for Adam’s offspring that which Adam’s transgression had lost for them. By this sacrifice of himself Christ Jesus could cancel or undo the effects of Adam’s sin toward humankind and, as it were, wash away their sins in his blood. It is not stated from where Aaron procured the bullock. This agrees with the fact that the life-right of the man Jesus was from God his Father, whereas his fleshly nature was from the human race.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah strengthened Job’s faith in God’s concern for him and unfailing providence for him by pointing to the divine care for the brute beasts away out in the wilderness. “Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor bam; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?” (Luke 12: 24) Ask the hardworking pioneers; they will tell you. Neither does Jehovah fail to provide the spiritual food from his table to his servants who maintain integrity right in the lair of the terrible totalitarian “beast”. By ways as strange as by the ravens which fed Elijah, Jehovah gets his spiritual food to those determined to keep integrity to Him and his Government even if threatened to starve physically for it as punishment. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

Therefore all the holy angels assembled, that is, took their stand on the side of that capital organization and its anointed Head, and pledged their everlasting and undying allegiance and service to him. There was thus a “full assembly” of them, and it was a time of greatest joy thus far in universal history because the long-promised Theocratic Government that will vindicate Jehovah’s holy name had now begun to function with its King upon the throne. “But ye have approached unto Zion’s mountain, and unto the city of a Living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, and unto myriads of messengers [angels] in high festival.” (Heb. 12:22,23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> “Festival” means a high and most important occasion.

The term means one whom Jehovah God raised up in a time of crisis and whom He appointed to lead the fight on religion, overthrow the power of the religious oppressors over his people, and thereafter uphold God’s law and Theocratic organization among them and render judicial decisions in harmony with such. To Christ Jesus Jehovah has committed all judgment and the power to execute judgment. (John 5: 22, 27) He was foreshadowed by the faithful judges whom Jehovah raised up in Israel.

They imitate the Greater Jephthah “as dear children”.

All who abide in her and support her and trust in her leadership shall go down into the ditch of “hell” with her, suffering a like fate as did the demon religionists of Jerusalem. Then only the prophet Jeremiah and his faithful companions, such as the Jonadabs and Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, escaped with their lives and with God’s approval.

<p><span class="font6">Human affection between creatures, which is generally passion according to the flesh, is no basis for one to place confidence respecting the Lord’s Kingdom interests in another earthly creature not in covenant with Him and not meeting his requirements. Fleshly relatives, having no fear or love of Jehovah or devotion to The Theocratic Government, do not consider close earthly relationship as obligating them to protect the confidence of relatives serving Almighty God. Now the demons are more active than ever and the “evil servant” and other religionists are hanging around with designs against the Theocratic interests.

They make a full consecration to God by Christ Jesus and devote themselves to The Theocracy and its praise and service. They become publishers for the Lord and strive to increase the number of publishers of The Theocracy by informing others of good-will and inviting them to a like course, to join the company going up to the “mountain of Jehovah”.

As the Gileadites brought Jephthah back from Tob to Mizpah his home, so the Theocratic organization was brought back to where it belonged.

To receive this ordination the witnesses were not first required to attend the theological school or seminary at Jerusalem and sit at the feet of the great professor of religion, Gamaliel, “Doctor of Laws.” (Acts 5:34; 22:3) To the contrary, that theological school and students attending it persecuted those who were anointed with God’s spirit and who were thereby ordained of Him to preach and be Jehovah’s ministers of the gospel.

It was God’s will that from then on there should be war against the new Government’s foes and that Satan’s rule, hitherto uninterrupted, should now be interfered with and destroyed. Christ Jesus being alone in the Government at its birth, he was in effect “the man child”. But besides the “man child” God’s organization must bring forth her other children to be members of God’s royal family in The Theocracy. Therefore the bringing forth of the “remnant of her seed” came after the travail of the war in heaven and the easting of Satan and his demons out of heaven. Then such “remnant” were acknowledged of God, approved as his representatives and sent forth to bear witness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The King of The Theocracy constitutes the “new heavens” in power since 1914, and Jehovah’s blessings come down therefrom like refreshing rain upon his faithful servants in the earth, the remnant and their companions. These have had their eyes open by God’s Word to see the anti-Theocratic “abomination of desolation” standing up in place of and as a substitute for God’s kingdom. They have fled from all parts of “Christendom” and taken refuge at the “mountains”, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, The Higher Powers. (Matt. 24: 15-18) There all those who seek meekness and righteousness grow and flourish like the grass, increasing to a multitude without number, and they shall not be cut down by Jehovah’s Executioner of the wicked in the battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font6">There are multitudes of isles, and if these are to yield up those who have waited for God’s Rule to come then there must be a multitude of such. The ancient ships of Tarshish made long journeys to far points, and the use of them as symbols would show that persons who have by circumstances been separated far from the Lord by previous opposition through blindness and misunderstanding of the Lord shall be brought into relationship with Jehovah’s organization. All such shall come and have part in the educational and constructive work of the Lord’s organization; for the time of God’s favor is come for all those seeking his organization.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah thus foretells how he will completely wreck and ruin exalted “Christendom”, and especially the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy. In this manner Jehovah emphasizes his purpose to destroy the hypocritical religionists, that no one will have any excuse to be ignorant of what is coming upon that great hypocritical and devilish organization. His purpose is to destroy “Christendom’s” superstructure and also he will wreck it and tear it down to its very foundations and sweep away its great heap of lies, and expose it to shame and disgrace. The Hierarchy and allied clergy and their “principal of the flock” have rejected Christ Jesus, the sure Foundation Stone, and now within a short time Jehovah shall completely destroy all that wicked organization. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the great and perfect Teacher. His instruction is always good and beneficial; for he is goodness, and to know him is of the greatest benefit. His perfect justice does not require him to provide rescue for the condemned, but in his mercy, which is his loving-kindness toward such, he gives timely and sufficient warning against the impending world disaster. He plainly points out the reason therefor, and to those who would escape he shows what is good in his sight and what he requires to win his approval and merciful protection and his deliverance from destraction with the doomed old world. The creature that desires life and who enters into a covenant or agreement to do Jehovah’s will binds himself to fulfill God’s requirements.

(Ps. 8: 4-8) His faithful members of “his body” who follow him are the house of sons of God, over which Christ Jesus is the Head. To these faithful followers he said: “Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matt. 5:5) Besides these who compose this ‘Tittle flock”, the Lord now brings “other sheep” into the fold, to wit, the people of good-will toward God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and who shall form the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9-17) If these hold fast their integrity and abide faithful to The Theocracy till Armageddon ends, their everlasting heritage will be life on earth under that righteous government. These now must seek righteousness and meekness to realize the promise of being “hid in the day of the Lord’s anger”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah also gathers his “sheep” from the mountains which are the backbone of Satan’s visible organization. To those mountains the people are taught by the clergy to look for protection, safety and a stable world. By Jehovah’s Theocratic message widely proclaimed by his remnant he opens the eyes of his “other sheep” to see the truth: “Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains.” (Jer. 3:23) These “other sheep” have been scattered by the false shepherds over all these “mountains” or ruling powers of the world. (Ezek. 34:6) After those who are yet scattered the Lord God sends his witnesses as hunters to do a thorough searching work, to locate the strayed and misled ones that desire to come into the fold under the protection of The Theocracy and its King, Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah’s vow meant that such human creature should henceforth not be retained in his home for the service and interests of his house, but should be dedicated to the Lord’s exclusive service. Whatever be the service such one is qualified for or is called upon to perform mattered not. By vowing to “offer it up for a burnt offering” meant that this human creature thus devoted should wholly and with fiery zeal serve God, rather than that Jephthah offer up a literal beast by fire upon the literal altar. (Pss. 69: 30, 31; 51:16, 17) The figure of a burnt offering indicated the wholeness and completeness with which he would dedicate the one the Lord designated.

Marriage of the righteous is a joyful occasion, and the earth will be filled with joy as these righteous servants of God marry the mates their King-Father arranges for them. With Eve’s sorrows of conception banished, they shall bring forth children with pleasure and in righteousness, not unto death and trouble, but unto life. They shall bring up these children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” and shall teach them to love Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus with all their mind, heart, soul and strength.

Such strongholds must be pulled down in their minds. They must render religion a dead thing to them. Their minds must be renewed by knowing and understanding the truths of Jehovah and his Theocracy. Only Jehovah can destroy the mighty, entrenched religious organization throughout the earth. He will do so at the beginning of Armageddon.

No one who advocates for that mighty Government can escape persecution from those that work for Satan’s opposition government. Christ Jesus was anointed with Jehovah’s spirit to be His chief witness and the King of the promised Government. He doomed the wicked purpose behind all the persecution to failure when he said to his followers: “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”—John 16: 33. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

All creatures he endowed with the power and ability to sing his praises as the heart expression of their adoration and devotion to him as the perfect sum of all righteousness and goodness. At the human birth of his Son, whose birth was a step toward the creation of new heavens and a new earth, the host of angelic sons of God appeared to the shepherds and let them hear their harmonious voices praising Jehovah and saying in unison: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of good-will.” (Luke 2:13,14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.}</span><span class="font6"> After Jehovah’s victory over ancient Egypt at the Red sea, his prophet Moses led His delivered people in song.

(Acts 24) Like that faithful apostle, Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to buy their way out. The apostles paid no fines for preaching God’s Word. Now when his servants are brought into court for obeying his command to publish his name and kingdom, they refuse to pay fines imposed by those who “judge for reward”, and, rather, go to prison. They do not compromise on the issue. They pay no creature for the privilege to preach, nor are they themselves paid to preach. God commands them, and they must keep integrity to Him.

The declaration of the “judgment written” by Jehovah’s witnesses has been a reproof to the nations. But it has not been strong enough nor in itself sufficient to make earth’s ruling powers mend their ways and yield to the incoming Theocratic Government. Jehovah must rebuke them with something stronger and more forceful than his message by his witnesses and companions. That He will do, by his great Executioner at Armageddon, and the tongue thus administering the rebuke is like a sword. “Jehovah will come ... to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.”—Isa. 66:15,16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.fi.V.</span><span class="font6"> W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

They have stubbornly fought against Jehovah’s witnesses’ publicly expressing His thoughts and have so remained willingly ignorant. His thoughts denote a turning of the tables upon those that seek to defile and destroy Jehovah’s Theocracy, Zion. Unlike the Nazi-Faseist-religious method of attacking without warning, God by his obedient witnesses has offered them good counsel. They have long trampled down and crushed Jehovah’s faithful people and their Kingdom message.

Their boundary or bound shall not be limited, but be pushed out to the ends of the earth in order that all those seeking life under God’s Kingdom may be brought into the place of refuge and preservation before Jehovah’s decree against his foes is executed. Therefore his organization Zion, which had seemed to be barren of children before the Kingdom’s birth in 1914, is now called upon to sing and cry aloud for joy. Why? Because of the increase of the children of her organization and of their earthly companions. (Isa. 54:1-3) In all lands the enemy desperately fight to prevent this increase of Jehovah’s organization.

Certainly no creature born in sin, and hence under condemnation of death, could gain life in the new world if he did not choose the Builder thereof and also its King. In order that such of them as turn to God in faith and obedience might have the way opened to gain and enjoy life in the new world, that disability must be lifted and removed.

Almighty God used the hands (powers) of his Elect Servant to carry out the divine purpose respecting the true “live goat” which was “for Azazel”. The sins, iniquities and transgressions of Israel here confessed were of the same kind as those of the tribe of Levi, Aaron’s house, for which the bullock’s blood atoned. They were sins and transgressions due to heredity from fallen Adam. That he might be sacrificed to relieve believing men of sin and wash away their sin in his own blood, Jesus in the flesh was perfect and without blemish, like that “live goat”, yet he humbled himself to appear as a sinner and be subject to reproach.

The events on earth fulfilling the apostle’s words that immediately follow the above quotation prove it beyond all denial. In A.D. 1914 The Theocratic Government of the new world was born. Since then Jehovah has held the nations in derision and says to them: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:1-6) Therefore Mount Zion represents the official Theocratic residence of Jehovah, the only true and living God. (Ps. 132:13,14) Those who seek God, Christianity, life and peace assemble to the Theocratic Mount Zion rather than to Rome.

Homage and worship are to be rendered to Them, and not to the modern Ammonites and the things these idolize. To this the religious-totalitarian Ammonites object. It is a failure, say they, to render to Caesar what is Caesar’s, a failure to recognize the supremacy of the state; which means that God has no prior or higher claims upon his covenant people at all. They argue that Jehovah’s witnesses drive them out of a field claimed from Nimrod’s time and which Jehovah’s people have not the right to invade, occupy or to explain and advertise to others. So they demand that Jehovah’s witnesses back down from their Christian position, and that without fighting back, or else—. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This shows that the Lord’s “other sheep” must count the cost and be tested to prove their love and agreeableness to forego all for Jehovah and the vindication of his name by his glorious Government. They must choose to become companions of the faithful remnant who bear reproaches such as came upon the Head Christ Jesus and also upon his Father, Jehovah. Sorrow, if any at all, for bearing such reproaches, they take out to the mountains under the vision of Him whose eyes ‘run to and fro through the earth’. When in company with His witnesses they share the rejoicing in the triumphs of his truth and “strange work”.

Hence it impudently moves to crack down with its rod of power upon the lot of Jehovah’s righteous ones and forcibly regiment them to put forth their hand to iniquity, lawlessness against God and their Gospel commission from Him. This Jehovah’s consecrated servants refuse to do. They have the Almighty’s assurance that though the rulers and their “abomination” beastly legislate and persecute, yet their wicked rod shall never rest and stay put upon the lot which God has assigned to his faithful righteous servants. (Ps. 125:3) They know and can prove their ordination and commission from the Most High, and such they will never let go.

Thus he fulfills his promise: “And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off.” (Zech. 9:10) Now God’s unified people pray for the peace and prosperity of his visible organization, saying: “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.” (Ps. 122:6-8) Any causing disturbance and division among God’s people who are trying to serve him without distraction show they are not of his house or organization.

<p><span class="font6">This is one of the eighteen “Hallelujah” Psalms, so called, which open with such rousing exhortation. It is an inspired call to action in praising Jehovah to one another and to all the nations, particularly the teachable ones thereof. The anointed remnant here addressed are by their anointing with God’s spirit commissioned to be his witnesses, witnesses to his honor and praise and not to his reproach. By their consecration of themselves to do God’s will, even when that will conflicts with dictatorial men, and also because they are taken by Jehovah into the covenant to serve him, they become the servants or ministers of God. By reason, further, of their anointing from him to preach His gospel or good news of the Kingdom they become Jehovah God’s ordained ministers of the gospel.

Thus Philip got word through and two of the apostles from headquarters, Peter and John, went up to Samaria to further organize the company of believers of that city and to equip them to give a more effective witness. The first wave of persecution dispersed the Christian witnesses of Jehovah, but the early church survived and increased. The intended destructive effects thereof did not materialize, but a wider witness and the growth of the church resulted. Jehovah God helped his faithful witnesses overcome then; He can likewise help and bless them under like conditions now. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Paul quotes this prophecy, at Romans 11: 25, 26. He applies it to the time the remnant of Christ’s body members are brought in from among all nations or Gentiles in order to make up the fullness of the 144,000 who will be the Kingdom body under Christ Jesus. The remnant are begotten of God’s spirit and are therefore spiritual Israelites. They are pictured by Jacob, who was surnamed Israel. “Christendom” commands that Jehovah’s remnant lower the standard of the new world of righteousness. But the remnant has been turned from transgression and all ungodliness of religion. They choose to “obey God rather than men” and to follow the example of their Leader, Christ Jesus. The standard remains aloft because the spirit of God Omnipotent is behind it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah’s name means “Opener”, or, “setting free.” He inherited some of his valor from his ancestor Ma-chir, but he was a “mighty man of valour” mainly because of his faith in Jehovah for whom Jephthah was a fighting witness. This is proved by the apostle’s record of ancient men of faith: “And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets.” (Heb. 11:32) Jephthah was like an earlier fighter, Gedeon, to whom the angel said: “The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.” (Judg. 6:12) An organization possessed of such faith and fighting qualities as Jephthah had is the need for this “time of war”, particularly from 1933 on, when the Nazi dictator became the “sword of his church”.

<p><span class="font6">The clergy or religious element will be first to be cast down by its present-day allies, politics and commerce. Revelation 17 shows the religion-ridden beast and its ten horns turning on its rider, the great harlot that mingles the things of God with the things of demon rule, and then destroying her. Her table of religious delicacies finally does not satisfy them or meet their needs and they recognize the religious organization as hypocritical. (Isa. 28: 8) As far as the people of good-will themselves are concerned, they have cast down religion and killed its influence and power over them. Like the eunuchs that east demon-worshiping Queen Jezebel out of the window at Captain Jehu’s command, so these people who were once religion’s dupes and slavishly pampered her now let her drop to meet the fate foretold in Jehovah’s judgment against the hypocritical religious organization.—2 Ki. 9: 30-37; Rev. 2: 20-23.

<p><span class="font6">It is Satan’s doings to now bring woes upon the people without previous warning. Jehovah’s course shows it is His rule to forewarn the disobedient of the evil to come and to mercifully allow persons of good-will an opportunity to hear, heed, and escape to safety and preservation. Therefore Jehovah squarely puts the question concerning the words which his witnesses declare : “Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?” Hence the ones that take offense show thereby that they are at fault and not walking uprightly before God. However, the religionists continue to justify themselves and to protest against the truth and to “fight against God”. Hence his words do good only to the people of good-will, who become the Lord’s “other sheep”. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

Men may take away from you the Watch Tower publications explaining God’s Word, but then you will have the Bible itself to use from house to house. That is more than the faithful disciples had in the days of Jesus and the apostles. Worldly authorities under the influence of religion may even rule that Jehovah’s witnesses do not know how to use the Bible and it is injurious in their hands. So they may take away from you God’s own Book, but then you will have the word of God in your mouths, and they will have to muzzle your very mouths to silence the spoken word.

<p><span class="font6">The slaying of that passover lamb was the beginning of God’s law covenant with Israel, because by its lifeblood the covenant was made valid, binding and operative. This pictured that no human creature can enter into a covenant with God to do His will except through the atonement which God provides in his Son. This “Lamb of God” takes away the sin of those who will live in the new world. (John 1:29) After the first passover came Israel’s deliverance by the destruction of Egypt’s firstborn. Quickly thereafter came the destruction of Pharaoh’s armies and chariots by Jehovah’s strange act at the Red sea. Both destructions upon Egypt pictured the destruction of both the visible and the invisible part of Satan’s world, both wicked men and demons.

<p><span class="font6">At this late date and so near the final end Jehovah’s anointed remnant and their companions should carefully consider, and all other interested persons of goodwill should consider, what great things the Lord God has done for those who have taken their stand on the side of his kingdom and held fast thereto with integrity and fulfilled their covenant obligations to him. Consider especially what great things he has done since 1925, when they discerned God’s purpose to make a name for himself and they determined thenceforth to honor Jehovah’s name and to declare it through all the earth. Since then, how Jehovah has unfolded to their wondering gaze the prophecies “written aforetime” showing just how he will make this everlasting name for himself and vindicate it! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

For this cause is the name thereof called Galeed; also The Watch Tower, as to which it is said, Jehovah watch betwixt me and thee, when we are parted one from another.—Gen. 31:48, 49, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s people, in a covenant to serve him according to his will and commandments, are his witnesses. The name “Galeed” means “heap of witness”. It refers to the testimony or memorial of witness set up in Gilead to mark the nonaggression pact or agreement made between Jacob and Laban the father of Jacob’s two wives. The pact guaranteed lasting peaceful relations between Jacob and Laban, his father-in-law. It called upon Jehovah to watch between the two as to mutual performance by each party of the terms of their agreement for peace. Today Jehovah’s covenant people enjoy “peace with God” through Christ as long as they keep covenant with Jehovah and do not fight against his Theocratic organization.

<p><span class="font6">Worldly pleasures are merely superficial and fleeting. They are demon-controlled and turn the attention and interest away from the only source of life and joy everlasting, to wit, The Theocratic Government, or Zion, which is prophetically called “the joy of the whole earth”, that is, of the “new earth”. (Ps. 48:2) The worldly pleasures are no part of the “joy of the Lord” nor of the “pleasures for evermore”, which are at His right hand. (Ps. 16:11) Therefore the faithful Christian whose hope is in the new world, wherein dwclleth righteousness, cannot rejoice with this doomed and dying world. Jehovah’s witnesses, as pictured by Jeremiah, have a great and serious job to do (Jer. 16: 8, 9), and the time in which to do it is limited by the approaching hour which God knows and has fixed for the beginning of Armageddon, “his strange act.” W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“The word of the Lord endureth for ever” (1 Pet. 1:25), and those desiring to live forever must feed thereon and throw religion to the dunghill. Particularly since 1922 the word of the Lord God Jehovah has gone forth from the heavenly Jerusalem. The wondrous truths of the Bible have been revealed, the prophecies have been made plain, and the doctrine of paramount importance has been made crystal clear, to wit, the Kingdom, The Theocracy, which shall settle the primary issue of universal domination wholly in Jehovah’s favor and in vindication of his name. Blessed are the remnant and all the meek ones of good-will who go up to the mountain of the Lord’s house and there feed upon his precious Word of life and light and who then keep his law by dispensing that Word abroad to feed his “other sheep”.

<p><span class="font6">In 1914 and at God’s command to rule in the midst of his enemies Christ Jesus stood up as acting King. Jehovah sent forth the rod of Christ’s strength out of Zion to rule (Ps. 110:2), and he appears at the temple as the Chief Shepherd. lie spreads a table for the remnant of his “little flock” in the presence of their enemies and feeds them and revives them continually with new strength in Jehovah’s “strange work”. As the Vindicator of his Father’s name he is clothed with excellency, “the majesty of the name of the Lord his God,” and he causes his remnant and their companions to declare Jehovah’s name and purpose throughout all the earth. All efforts of the enemy fail to dislodge them from the temple where they “abide” faithful and serve God. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

Why, then, should she be offended at having her failure pointed out by Jehovah’s witnesses? Why should she get wearied by their persistence in warning her at God’s command and then try to stop them by mobs, Catholic Action, government bans, and refined persecution carried on under the cloak of legality and “special emergency” laws and measures ? It is not unreasonable of Jehovah to keep on sending his witnesses to her. He knows the importance of the matter deserves it. “Testify against me,” says lie; but the religionists cannot answer on Scriptural grounds of argument. Spitefully, therefore, the religionists testify falsely against Jehovah’s witnesses to discredit them and their message. Men of good-will are not wearied, but welcome their visits.

The “other sheep”, who also follow that Lamb, take refuge under that capital organization in submission to The Higher Powers. They are like the non-Israelite Nethinim who returned with the remnant from Babylon to Jerusalem and took up service of assistance to God’s ministers at the temple on Mount Zion. (Ezra 2: 70) The command to “glorify” and “praise” Jehovah God is addressed to “Jerusalem” and “Zion”, that is, to the entire organization as one. This, therefore, is a call to action to the faithful remnant together with their earthly companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, to serve the Lord God in an organized manner, that is, as one united organization dedicated to the praise and glorifying of the Great Theocrat.

<p><span class="font6">In so-called “democratic” lands the intolerant religious forces have prevailed upon the political element to officially decree Jehovah’s organization not licensed or authorized to operate, and the acting as one of Jehovah’s witnesses to be an “illegal” act punishable with fine and imprisonment. This anti-God move by dupes of religion does not in any wise cancel or nullify the covenant of Christians there to do Jehovah’s will as Christ Jesus gives the example. It does not blot out or make null and void the commission which God lays upon his consecrated servants to declare His name throughout all the earth and to preach the good tidings of his Righteous Government and to comfort all that mourn. This commission is binding upon them until the end. Therefore they will follow the apostolic course to “obey God rather than men”. They will continue, and they do continue, to preach as Christians.

(Phil. 1: 28) The perplexity of the situation is increased for them because the remnant and their companions, obedient to God’s command, will not be bulldozed by official threats into silence, but keep on coming continually and always stronger, and the enemy refuse to recognize God’s commission and command to these his witnesses. Only by using totalitarian methods to suppress the preachers of God’s kingdom and vengeance do they feel that they shall solve their perplexity and at length be able to say “Peace and safety!” (1 Thess. 5:3) Then Jehovah will turn the tables on them, to stay turned.

They take advantage of their adversary and stab him in the back. Jehovah proceeds exactly in a contrary manner, because fie is righteous, always right. When the time comes for him to fight he gives the enemy full and fair warning and then tells him to get ready and do his worst, because the enemy is to be destroyed. At the same time he gives fair warning to the people, including all those of good-will who desire righteousness, warning them of the day of the expression of his wrath upon Satan and his organization. This he does in order that those of good-will who hear and give heed may flee to the only place of safety, God’s kingdom under Christ.

<p><span class="font6">To “take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain” does not mean when the man in the street uses vile language. The one who has consecrated himself to do the will of Jehovah God, exercising faith in Christ Jesus as his Savior, and who starts to follow in Jesus’ footsteps and then draws back, has taken the name of God in vain. Or if he takes a course contrary to what the Scriptures point out, becoming heady, haughty and high-minded and smiting his brethren, he has received the name of God in vain. Those who take God’s name in vain bring great reproach upon his name. Their end is destruction. Some may ignorantly get off on the wrong path after taking the Lord’s name, but, when receiving warning and knowledge directing them in the right way, if they would live they must quickly change their course and walk in the right way.

He enlightens the eyes of their understanding by the unfolding of God’s Word and thus ‘comes up before them’. They recognize him as their Leader. Following after the King of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, the faithful remnant broke the entanglements of the besetting sin of religion, and the bonds of the fear of men, and marched forth through the gate of Babylon and into the “liberty of the sons of God”. They followed no man, but recognized that the Kingdom had come, that Christ Jesus is the King and rightful Ruler of the new world, and that Jehovah was and is the Head over all.

<p><span class="font6">God’s universal organization is called “Zion”, and is the mother organization from which comes forth The Theocracy, the capital organization. The latter is therefore the “daughter of Zion”. The “daughter” takes the name of the mother and is also called “Zion”. Galatians 4:26 also says: “Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” Hence the royal family of The Theocracy is also called “the daughter of Jerusalem”. Typical Zion was a “strong hold”, “liill” or “mound”. In 1914 Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus was begun. The “chief dominion” and “kingdom” coming to Christ Jesus, Zion’s anointed Chief and King, he forthwith took up the scepter and began to rule. Let all lovers of God and his kingdom rejoice.

<p><span class="font6">The remnant must be “bold as a lion”, “which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any.” (Prov. 28:1; 30:30) Their loving companions have like devotion to The Theocracy and are likewise bold. Both the remnant and their companions follow “the Lion of the tribe of Juda” and work havoc with religion. Compared with the royal “Lion of the tribe of Juda” the religious-totalitarian crowd are but a flock of sheep for prey. At Armageddon Jehovah will let him loose upon the prey and he will go through them and tear to pieces all those branded with ‘the mark of the beast and his image’.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ exclusiveness in the sin-offering is thus shown. The whole work rests upon Christ Jesus, and he did a complete job, unassisted by any other creature (“man”). At this point Aaron the high priest pictured Christ Jesus alone, and not the composite Christ, that is, Jesus the Head and the church his body. He is “the High Priest of our profession”. (Heb. 3:1) This demonstrates that the Lord’s goat of the sin-offering could not represent the church or body of The Christ, but the goat equally with the bullock foreshadowed Jesus’ all-sufficient sacrifice, which makes full propitiation. “This he did once, when he offered up himself.”—Heb. 7:27.

<p><span class="font6">The spirits of all creatures are being judged, which creatures are being shown to be either of a faithful spirit toward God and his Kingdom gospel or of an unfaithful, opposing spirit toward God and his gospel purpose. The “righteous ones made perfect” are the spirit-begotten remnant of the “little flock”, who are approved at the temple judgment and anointed to be Jehovah’s witnesses and are covered over with his “robe of righteousness” and “garments of salvation”. (Isa. 61: 1, 10) These must be perfected in their integrity and spirit of obedience and devotion toward God, just as it was necessary for Jesus to ‘learn obedience and be made perfect in this by the things he suffered’.

Enemies of the light and truth of The Theocracy tried to deal them a knock-out blow in 1918, but the Redeemer came to Zion and its temple and raised them up out of dust and darkness. Now keeping God’s command, they will never again obey opponents of his kingdom and lie prone in the dust. Zion has arisen to shine for all time, because, by the King’s coming to the temple, Jehovah has arisen with favor upon his organization. His glory is seen upon the faithful remnant in that he has honored them in making them his witnesses and the ambassadors for his established and acting Government. They are privileged to receive its light and transmit it on to others who sit in darkness longing for the light.—1 Pet. 2:9. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span></p>

It is a power for light, and that is what it brought to this globe. In the day of earth’s creation when a vast cloud canopy covered the entire globe like swaddling bands of thick darkness, “the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, and God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” Destructive darkness due to powers of demonism now hangs over earth’s inhabitants. Worldly leaders say only the morale of the people can carry them through. However, in the final battle, Armageddon, after which the righteous new world comes, it will not be morale that will carry any people through, but the spirit of Jehovah God, his power unto victory.

In fulfillment of his prophecies, he has given them repeated triumphs over religion and its clergy. All gains for truth and for the Kingdom interests which God’s witnesses have gained by His grace, they refuse to yield up even under threats, ultimatums and cruel pressure of religion’s political allies. God-given conquests they will abide by, and not yield to any enemy countermove to thrust them back into darkness and bondage. Being given the light, they will not put it under the bushel which totalitarian rule would use as a black-out; they will put the light on the candlestick to give light and comfort to those mourning in darkness.—Matt. 5:15,16.

The battle was to be Jehovah’s, and likewise the victory. In order that the faith and integrity of his covenant people might be tested and demonstrated, Jehovah did not order horse-mounted warriors or horse-drawn chariots or hardened shock-troops strong of leg to take the lead in the aggressive action. Under heavenly guidance Jehovah’s anointed king put the chief emphasis upon declaring God’s name throughout the earth before Jehovah showed his power over the enemy and vindicated his name. “And when he had given counsel unto the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army.”—Vs. 21 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew).</span><span class="font6"> TV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s Fighter for the new world of righteousness is his beloved Son, who has been equipped for the fight with all power in heaven and in earth. This makes the righteous new world a sure thing. Since 1914 we have been in the period the Scriptures call “the day of Jehovah”. Therefore we know that the fight is near, because it is the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. Now that the day has begun, his Son has been enthroned as King and the time is at hand to establish the world to which his kingdom belongs. In the coming battle of Armageddon Jehovah’s Son will this time fight against the old world and with violence such as all creation has never yet witnessed. The old world and all its organizations of men will be destroyed. IF </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Those whom the Lord now gathers as his “other sheep” have been preyed upon by the totalitarian “beast” and “his image”, and have been scattered, and have hid themselves upon “every mountain” and “every hill” and in “the holes of the rocks”, for fear of men and demonized creatures. Now, before Armageddon breaks, these must be sought out and stirred up to come forth and identify themselves as for the great Theocrat and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Now at the time Jehovah by Christ Jesus is about to “rise up to the prey” against the enemies of God and his people, he sends forth his remnant of anointed witnesses and their devoted companions on the hunt for the scattered ones of good-will who desire to come into the Lord’s fold, there to enjoy peace and safety and the Lord’s provided food.

<p><span class="font6">God foretold that other righteous creatures would be associated with his only begotten Son in The Theocracy, the “new heavens”. God would love those creatures who showed such devotion to righteousness as to qualify for that heavenly privilege. Looking to the creation of the “new heavens”, and in order to provide the way for such ones to be changed from human to spirit, God gave his beloved Son to be the ransom. Thereby these might be “redeemed from among men”. (Rev. 14:4) The Theocracy, of which Christ Jesus is the Chief and Essential One, and the vindication of God’s name by it, is far more vital than salvation of human creatures. No one can have everlasting life except he believes in The Theocracy as the only hope and then devotes himself to it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 119 fl 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Not in their own strength and power can they bear up under the persecution, and hold fast the treasure of the ministry as ambassadors of The Theocracy and witnesses of the Most High. They are in frail flesh, in earthly vessels, and hence it must be Jehovah’s great power in and through them that must excel and surpass the power of those assailing their integrity. The members of the “body of Christ” live for no other purpose than to follow the same course as Jesus in bearing witness to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. “Howbeit we have this treasure [ministry] in earthen vessels, that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves; on every side pressed hard, but not hemmed in; without a way, but not without a by-way; pursued [persecuted], but not abandoned; thrown down, but not destroyed.”— 2 Cor. 4:1,7-10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span><span class="font6"> W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">These words hold out glorious hope for all men who love truth and who turn from sin and desire to do right on the earth under new heavenly government, The Theocratic Government. The principal term upon which they receive the good effects of the propitiation is that they must forever be for a vindication of God's name in contradiction of the infamous reproaches that the Serpent has brought upon God’s name. “Propitiation” means that thing which makes propitious, favorable, that is, the thing which removes the reason for God to condemn the creature and which therefore brings the creature into the mercy, favor and loving-kindness of God. It removes the charge of sin as the cause of condemnation to death from all who avail themselves of the propitiation.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah opens the way into the new world, a world free of all demon rule and totalitarian aggression, enslavement and cruelty. By a fight, the greatest in universal history, Jehovah sets free those who now suffer for righteousness’ sake and who shall enjoy life abundantly and without end in the new world. That fight is near at hand. By his beloved Son, who judges the nations and makes war in righteousness, Jehovah of hosts will surprise all enemies by the suddenness of his attack. Then all nations that scoff at the Bible record of his past battle performances and who mock his witnesses shall see Jehovah in action for the avenging of his name. Their destruction will leave the new world forever free of them. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“Mareshah” means “inheritance”. “Christendom” claims the inheritance of the Kingdom and seeks to be the “inhabitress” thereof. But Jehovah alone will decide the issue of world domination: “The possessor I will bring unto thee, 0 inhabitress of Mareshah.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.,</span><span class="font6"> margin) That possessor or heir is Jehovah’s anointed and appointed King of his Theocratic Government, Christ Jesus, and the government of the new world shall be upon his shoulder forever. “Christendom” will not inherit the Kingdom ; her chief religious representative will not inherit with Christ Jesus, and her two “kings” shall not gain the world domination. All these shall be destroyed at Armageddon by Jehovah’s “heir of all things”. Christ Jesus becomes possessor of the dominion, by conquest as well as by Jehovah’s appointment and authorization.

<p><span class="font6">Those “shepherds” know how to fight the totalitarian giant as the shepherd boy David did. Christ Jesus is “the Chief Shepherd”, and his rod is for the protection of his sheep. The nations going totalitarian he shall feed with death and destruction. (Ps. 2:8,9) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Seven</span><span class="font6"> represents spiritual completeness, and the “seven shepherds” must represent the complete number of those in the covenant with Christ Jesus for the Kingdom and who overcome religion and are conformed to his image. (Rev. 2:26) Therefore the besieged and assaulted remnant and companions make the Greater David, Christ Jesus, their shield and protector against the invading Assyrian. They look for victory to their “Chief Shepherd”, who represents the Great Shepherd, Jehovah. Meantime the remnant continue feeding his “other sheep”.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freely ye have received, freely give.—Matt. 10:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The message of the Kingdom is not to be kept selfishly. Jehovah’s faithful “remnant” are commanded to go and preach it in all the world for a witness to all nations. In turn, all of good-will who hear are commanded to let others hear: “And the Spirit and the bride [including Jehovah’s remnant] say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) Micah 4:2 foretells that such “shall go [to others; also parents to their children] and say, Come ye, and let us [together] go up to the mountain of Jehovah”. (A.R.V.) This shows that the Lord now extends to them a part in his “strange work” of witnessing to The Theocracy. Today these “other sheep” in their increasing thousands take up the joyful burden of the Lord’s work alongside of the remnant. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord shall be a light unto me.—Mic. 7:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was darkness for the time in the minds of God’s devoted ones as to understanding why His enemies should be permitted apparently to triumph over them while honestly and diligently seeking to do his will. In God’s displeasure and for their chastisement he had permitted them to fall under the enemy organization, Babylon. Now noting their repentance, their prayerful resolves to serve him if given further privileges, and their unbreakable cleaving to Jehovah, he turned his brightening favor upon the remnant of Zion. By his Judge at the temple he ordered them delivered. The enemy were obliged to yield. He enlightened their minds as to their commission on earth to be a “people for his name”. He has sent them forth to reflect upon others that light which he shines on them by Christ Jesus at the temple. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The gospel must first be published.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The really serious question is not, Which “king” will get on top with world domination? but, Shall Jehovah’s Theocratic Government exercise universal domination? Of what avail is it if one “king” gets on top temporarily, if shortly thereafter all “Christendom”, together with heathendom, is wiped out at Armageddon for not meeting God’s requirements? Hence “Christendom’s” view that Jehovah’s witnesses are wasting time and are a nuisance and serving no vital, essential purpose is upside down. Their proclamation of the gospel is the most vital and pressing service from which all peoples can benefit lastingly. The creature’s relationship to the Supreme Power and to the Government of “The Higher Powers” is of greater importance than the relationship to any earthly organization and it involves the creature’s eternal life and happiness.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let us go forth therefore unto him. without the camp, bearing his reproach.—Heb. 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bearing his reproach does not atone for sin, but the shedding of the blood of the “man Christ Jesus’’ does so. In the type, the world in sin and wickedness was pictured as “without the camp”; and verse 14 shows that Christ’s body members bear reproach outside the camp because they are not of this world, but of the world of righteousness which is to come according to God’s promise: “For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.” They seek God’s capital organization, The Theocracy, and hence take their stand with the reproached Christ Jesus in this present world, “without the camp.” Verse 15 adds: “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” They do not offer up a sacrifice for a sin-offering, because Christ Jesus did that himself once.

<p><span class="font6">Already the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists see signs of the end for them and are busy trying to deliver or “set in safety” their religion and clergy system and control of the religious population. Religionists of “the king of the south” still excuse the failure of the League of Nations and clamor for its revival after the total war. The Axis Powers have founded a “new League of Nations”, that “new order” so fervently desired by the Hierarchy of Vatican City. The political and commercial elements will carry religion safely through the total war and enable her thereafter to cry “Peace and safety!” They shall never carry her alive through Armageddon, but will turn upon her and destroy her when God exposes her to them at Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

Then Jeremiah warned the court that heard his case that they would bring innocent blood upon themselves if they killed him for the message he proclaimed at God’s command. Therefore the Lord protected him against the bloodthirsty religious harassers. He never forsook the Lord’s assignment of territory to him. He continued carrying on in the land of Judah, and the Lord spared him to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the fulfillment of God’s prophecies by the mouth of Jeremiah, and the overthrow of his religious persecutors. He always warned against going down to Egypt, even after Jerusalem was destroyed and the few people left in the desolated land became panicky. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

It shall reach its height of jubilation at the smashing grand climax of the “&quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty”, Armageddon. Therefore let the remnant and their devoted companions not flinch under increasing opposition, reproach and persecution. Let them continue to move on in unbreakable unity, fighting shoulder to shoulder against the enemies of Jehovah and his King. Let their heart’s affection be fixed immovably upon The Theocracy, and let the love of Christ hold them faithful to their covenant with Jehovah God unto the end, all for the vindication of his glorious and holy name.

The Nethinim or “other sheep” must flee to it and take refuge under it before the battle of Armageddon begins for the execution of all those who have not lined up on its side. Those who persecute the remnant and their companions because they take their stand for Zion only cause themselves unnecessary troubles and hang a weighty stone about their necks: “All that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” (Zech. 12:3) Remember what happened to King Sennacherib’s 185,000 Assyrians who besieged Jerusalem.

Attention is called to this because it seems to be necessary to repeatedly warn some of the consecrated that there now rests upon them a very great obligation and duty, and their failure to give heed to the Scriptures, which Jehovah has caused to be written by his prophets, will bring all such negligent ones to the point of adverse judgment, which they will receive. God is no respecter of persons, and each one who hears His commandments is responsible to the Lord. Those who get life must fully obey the commandments given by Jehovah.

The revealing of these truths to his witnesses in this day of Jehovah lays upon the consecrated and the anointed ones a far greater obligation than they have heretofore had or seen. What is his purpose in now permitting his people to have an understanding of his prophecies? Manifestly his chief purpose is that his people may see and understand their great privilege of bearing his name and telling the people of God’s purpose before Jehovah’s great power is executed against the enemy.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses brandish the “sword of the spirit” and expose the ‘desolating abomination’ of modern Assyria as a demonic counterfeit of God’s holy Kingdom. They carry the battle to the gates of the religious-totalitarian combine, “in the entrances thereof.” (A.V.) The “swords” will not be sheathed until the battle is won and religion is completely killed off. “In the entrances thereof” also means that Christ Jesus will not only destroy the totalitarian rule on earth but also carry the battle into the wicked spirit organization, “the land of Magog,” and there destroy all the demons and Gog their prince and Satan their chief. The sure hope for the deliverance of humankind from totalitarian rule under demons is Jehovah’s mighty Shepherd, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As to the warning delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, particularly down to 1940, the Lord has not asked whether they wanted to hear, but he sent forth the warning in mercy and fairness. Likewise in due time he will not ask whether the totalitarian ruling factors of “Christendom” want to hear, but, shortly now, “tidings out of the east [from Christ the King] and out of the north [from Jehovah] shall trouble him [the rulers gone totalitarian] : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.” (Dan. 11:44) This furious action proves that such totalitarian-religious fighters against Jehovah’s Theocratic Government did not want to hear, but were displeased at what they heard and therefore will try to make away with Jehovah’s witnesses and their faithful companions.

<p><span class="font6">The sins of the world lying in the wicked one Satan were not the sins put upon the head of the “live goat”, but the sins were of those who had come into relationship with God, namely, the camp of Israel, together with the strangers sojourning among them. The camp had provided this “goat”, even as Jesus was born of the covenant people of God, and his nature was man’s, but his life and life-right were from God his Father. The Israelites must have felt great relief as they saw the goat led out of the camp and into the unknown. This illustrates Christ Jesus serving as the Sin-Bearer. (Isa. 53:12) John the Baptist testified: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world I” that is, that sin of those who will inherit life in the new world.

The prophecy replies that “they”, meaning the survivors of earth’s worst tribulation, to wit, the “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep”, shall “beat their [the enemies’] swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks”. The prophecy makes it certain that equipment used in violation of God’s “everlasting covenant” (Gen. 9: 6, 11) and to war against Jehovah’s universal domination will be wrecked at Armageddon and thereafter be collected and converted into upbuilding things of usefulness and productiveness. In this work the “great multitude” will be helped and supervised by the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, joined now by the faithful men of old raised to life.

They are lifted up above the world current and are going whither He leads them. They know where they are going, and that is, to the Kingdom of God, the Government of the Theocratic new world.

This gathering together to the Lord’s side must take place before the final war of Armageddon. Hence those gathered must now flee from the enemy organization and to The Theocracy. The time has come to the full for the administration or “dispensation” of Christ Jesus at God’s right hand, and the gathering has been in progress now since 1918, first of the spiritual class, and more recently of the other class who shall live on earth forever in peace and happiness under the righteous dispensation of The Theocracy.—Eph. 1: 9,10.

(Ps. 68:11) The demons and their human dupes make these their target and direct their fire against them. They lay siege against them to wear them out and to make them break their covenant with God and their integrity toward him and to forsake their uncompromising stand for The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s servants are in the world or enemy’s country, but are not of it, and hence are surrounded by spying enemies, scheming damage to the things of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The interests of that righteous government have been committed to God’s “faithful and wise servant”, his devoted remnant under Christ. This is a position of great trust, and they must anxiously safeguard those “goods” or Kingdom interests against the destructive enemy; for they must give account to Jehovah God and his King. “For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.” (Rom. 14:4,10) The enemy, everywhere about, use “fifth column” ways to get in among or next to those having a trust from God and to spy and gather information to use against Jehovah’s organization. Concerning such, “trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide.”—Mic. 7:5. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The winter is the time of Jehovah’s “strange act” of the great fight of Armageddon. It follows immediately after the swift running of Jehovah’s Word, “his strange work.” To “Christendom” it is a “strange work”, and she objects thereto. The demons now try to regiment the work off the earth and to regiment all the people against it and all the publishers out of it. God’s Word will continue to run swiftly until the purpose for which he sent it forth is accomplished. That purpose is, to serve all with clear warning; and to point the meek persons of good-will to the way of escape to the mountains of safety, Zion and Jerusalem. There is no time to delay flight. The “abomination that mak-eth desolate” has appeared. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When one thus suffers as the target of reviling, and evil false charges, and other forms of persecution, it proves that such one is on the side of righteousness for which Jehovah’s glorious Government stands. The reward to such faithful one is 'great in heaven’, because the Rewarder of faith and faithfulness is in heaven. The reward He bestows is sure and unfading and infinitely greater than any selfish rewards that all the enemy organization on earth could bestow upon anyone yielding to its persecution. All the faithful prophets which were before Christ Jesus underwent persecution, and the apostle of the Lord writes that it was because they were witnesses, witnesses for Jehovah. (Heb. 11:1-12:1) Christ Jesus was and is Jehovah’s Greatest Prophet, whom Jehovah has “given . . . for a witness to the people”.

<p><span class="font6">Such war of the Israelites was a righteous war, because it was commanded of Jehovah of hosts and was for his Theocracy in Israel. Israel’s invasion of Canaan was under the leadership of the Creator and Owner of the earth. It was therefore no act of selfish totalitarian aggression. Destruction of the heathen inhabitants was no violation of the sixth commandment nor of God’s everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of the blood of life. The Israelites were commanded to act as God’s executional forces. He was providing a homeland for the operation of Theocracy in full force. Such was the typical picture foreshadowing how Almighty God will cut off from the earth all nations that forget Jehovah God. Then he will settle permanently on earth all who worship Him and obey his Theocratic Government. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The identity as Jehovah’s approved and commissioned witnesses is pictured as a robe. The enemy sneeringly speak of them as “Jehovah’s witnesses” and challenge their right to this “new name”. They “pull off the robe” from the undergarment, figuratively speaking. (Mie. 2:8) So doing, they would make God’s covenant people to outwardly appear as without marks of God’s true organization and not beautified with the true Kingdom gospel. Instead, they accuse them of being disguised hawkers, propagandists, Communists, seditious, engaging in commercial work for selfish gain, proselytizers, and disturbers of the public peace and invading the rights of others to worship God as they please. Say Jehovah’s witnesses: “I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.” (Ps. 120:7) The faithful servants continue on in obedience to God’s commands, and thereby “put to silence the ignorance of foolish men”.—1 Pet. 2:15.

<p><span class="font6">There is now a great controversy on concerning effective requirements for life. Jehovah God is the Fountain of life, and to him salvation belongs. (Pss. 36:9; 3:8) He declares that all who conform to and abide under Satan’s organization shall be destroyed with it at Armageddon by Jehovah’s Executioner. Jehovah through his Word reveals that the only place of safety and preservation unto life throughout the great deluge of Armageddon is the Ark of his organization. All seekers after everlasting life must take refuge in it. His command to his faithful remnant is that they must now aid the refugees of good-will to that only place of security and life, and must make known to them Jehovah’s life requirements. Such life requirements they must fulfill while abiding within his place of refuge. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

They wanted field-service reorganization. The field maneuvers must be done orderly, with proper organization instructions from the right source subject to God’s guidance. Those princes and the people of Gilead looked for the one chosen of the great Theocratic Ruler, the God of Israel. In the crisis they wanted unified, central command! They desired to have a Theocratic representative to be at the head and to issue God’s instructions. The Theocratic organization is the only way to meet the total state under demon control.

Religious politicians will entrust religion with the task. Religion will then assume to undertake it.

They renounce all personal headship and all democratic personal rights within God’s organization as concerns the carrying on of his work of witness.

<p><span class="font6">The <sup>&lt;;</sup>new world” being all righteous, God does not condemn it, but this present evil world He does condemn and doom to destruction. When Jesus presented himself in consecration, was immersed in Jordan, and was then begotten of God’s spirit and anointed to be the King of the world to come, then and there the foundation of that world was laid. Thus God sent his Son into that world. Not to judge that righteous world was he sent, nor to condemn it. However, those to be associated with him in the “new heavens”, and those to be the “princes” and to compose the “new earth”, were born sinners and condemned. Hence these needed salvation to life in order to be able to serve in the new world. Therefore God sent the Son that such ones of the new world might be saved. WL 121</span></p>

If now Jehovah God would grant victory to his covenant people as against such encroachments on Jehovah’s worship and service, then whatsoever would first appear as fruit of such victory in the way of an ingathering would be wholly dedicated to His “strange work”, the work of his temple class. There would be no selfish exploitation of such “other sheep” by the remnant, such as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy make of the “Catholic population”.

<p><span class="font6">“Christendom” has the Bible in its completeness, with its record of the warning examples of the ten tribes of Israel, and of Judah and Jerusalem. “Christendom” has not taken heed thereto, nor regarded the warning of Jehovah’s witnesses. Hence her lawlessness and her sins of religion are “double”, manifold greater in enormity than those of the typical covenant people of Jehovah God. God duly recompenses “Christendom”, and none can continue in or under her for any length of time without experiencing a measure of that recompense. The full recompense will come at Armageddon, now near. Therefore it behooves Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions to lose no time, but to make every effort and use every opportunity to aid all persons of good-will to get out promptly lest these share “Christendom’s” destruction.

Only by following this course dare they hope to escape destruction and to survive Armageddon and thereafter form part of the “great multitude” that live and become children of The King. The covenant of consecration that they make with God they must faithfully keep, to enjoy fulfillment of Uis promise: “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.” (Ps. 25: 10) His truth and testimonies concerning his purposes they must declare in unity with the remnant, and thus go over the “highway” with them.

<p><span class="font6">This prophecy voices the prayer of the remnant that God’s rule be put into operation among his organized people on earth. His rule is not “popular rule”, but is Theocratic rule. The request for feeding and shepherding is addressed to the Great Shepherd, Jehovah. (Ps. 23:1) His “rod” is his Mighty One, Christ Jesus, “the Chief Shepherd.” He has now come to the temple and judges first “the house of God” and thereafter all the nations, the people of which he divides as “sheep” and “goats”. His “rod of iron” is reserved for the anti-Theocratic nations, to dash them to shivers; but as for the remnant of Jehovah’s “little flock” it is written: “Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.” (Ps. 23:4) Concerning Jehovah’s “Rod”, the One who majestically represents God’s authority, Micah 5 : 4 says: “He shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font6"> W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Such praises are beneficial, and point the hearers to the only Source of life and blessing and of a righteous and perfect government. Those praises to Jehovah bar the giving of praise to creatures or demons or men and the fearing and heiling and worshiping of such creatures, which course leads to destruction. Hence it is of the highest good to sing praises to Jehovah God in fulfillment of one’s obligations as his ordained minister. Nothing could be more vital to the people in this time of “distress of nations, with perplexity”, when the world is faced with utter destruction. Jehovah’s faithful servants will be on the alert against being entrapped into any other view of the matter.

Hence, though the Vatican’s plans for world conquest in 1940 got an unexpected setback that very year, the infliction of pain, cruelty, loss of liberty and rights and property, and other un-Christian injustices upon Jehovah’s inoffensive servants continues. Those who have the welfare of the people at heart are concerned. They realize that if the fight to maintain freedom to publish the truth, to speak what is comforting and beneficial to fellow men, to assemble for open discussion and study of what is to the highest interest and everlasting welfare, and to worship God according to His commandments and instructions is lost, then all is lost.—Ps. 9 :17.

Thereby he would come to the perfection of his obedience toward God and would overcome Satan’s world and so prove worthy to sit down with his heavenly Father in His throne. He must suffer in order to reign thereafter. Hence when Jesus should thus die faithful to Jehovah he would not leave Jesus’ soul in hell, but would raise him out of death on the third day unto life evermore. This meant that Jesus would return to life in the spirit with his Father in heaven. Moreover, and in a secondary order, it was Jehovah’s will that Jesus should at the same time offer his perfect human life as a sacrifice, to serve the purpose of a sin-offering that faithful men might have the wav opened to gain life in the new world.—John 14: 6.

They must then bear witness to his name and kingdom, carrying forth the Kingdom fruits to others, and continuing faithful and in integrity in doing God’s expressed good and perfect will.

Both remnant and “other sheep” shall be hid from the expression of Jehovah's fierce and consuming anger at Armageddon. His decree of destruction will not be directed at them.

<p><span class="font6">Great favor has been bestowed upon us to have revealed to us Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ and to be privileged to devote ourselves to Jehovah and to assemble unto His Kingdom. That Righteous Government of the new world shall not disappoint or fail us; it is here, and “shall stand for ever”. May we therefore never forsake it or keep silent about it. Keeping confidence in it and standing immovably by it at Armageddon, we shall not be shaken and removed while the terrific shaking of the Devil’s wicked “heavens” and “earth” tears them to pieces. To our enemies who hate The Theocracy let our awe-inspiring God be a “consuming fire” at Armageddon. But let us with great gratitude continue to serve him in the manner acceptable to him.

<p><span class="font6">That does not mean personal private ownership, although doubtless humankind that lives will have the pleasure of planting many vines and trees. In Scripture symbols the vine and the fig tree both represent the “kingdom of heaven” class and the fruit that such bear to the relief, comfort and joy and sweetening of those that accept the Lord’s message, the fruit of the vine picturing joys, and the fig tree picturing the goodness and sweetness due to the Kingdom. The “kingdom of heaven”, of which Christ Jesus is the true vine and all His body members are the branches, is The Theocracy. Under that great symbolic Vine and Fig Tree all humankind on earth shall “sit” in trusting dependence and shall receive of the joys and sweet blessings of the great King-Father, their Provider, Christ Jesus.—Ps. 67: 6, 7. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The faithful know the issues involved. They know it means their destruction to be unfaithful to their commission, thereby supporting the Devil’s side of the issue. They will uphold God’s side of the issue. No political government on earth, not to speak of Satan’s entire organization or world, will succeed by the faithful remnant and “other sheep” in proving that Jehovah cannot put to the test creatures who under persecution by Satan’s organization will faithfully abide in God’s organization, so maintaining their integrity. Let worldly governments face that fact, and know that they must bear the full responsibility for what they do to try to injure God’s organization and drive his consecrated witnesses out of it. Governments, in dealing with Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, are being forced to learn that they are coping with those in whom He has put the spirit of unbreakable love for The Theocracy.

So too after the winter of Armageddon the remnant and companions will come forth from their protected place under God’s hiding and enter into the glorious season of the Kingdom in its undisputed power over earth. (Job 37: 22-24) Then all that live on earth shall be cheered with the warmth of God’s mercy through his reigning King. Peace shall flow like a mighty river everlasting, and righteousness shall be multiplied on the earth like the waves of the sea, and His blessings shall drop like gentle rain.—Isa. 48:18.

<p><span class="font6">Just how the series of battles was fought and the Lord God put the Ammonites at the mercy of Jephthah and his Theocratic fighters is not described in detail. The battle was Jehovah’s. He fought and maneuvered the course of battle and gave a resounding victory to his men of faith, courage and unselfishness. Victory, not details of battle, is the outstanding thing! Recently the modern Ammonites have encroached upon the full, proper and rightful exercise of Jehovah’s worship by his covenant people. But His servants under Greater Jephthah smite the aggressors with the “sword of the spirit”, with Bible arguments in which they were trained to meet and repel the totalitarian encroachments on the worship of God. Jehovah’s witnesses are not pacifists, but fighters for the new world, in God’s way. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has declared his unchangeable purpose to give the occupancy of the earth wholly over to those who worship him as the Most High and Almighty God. Both the prophecies and the shattering world events of the day in fulfillment speak eloquently to testify that the execution of his purpose is shortly to take place. The final outcome will be a Paradise to the four corners of the earth, and inhabited by perfect human creatures in Jehovah’s own image and likeness. The most pressing personal issue for each one who desires life on earth in the new world is the worship of Jehovah. Acquainting the people with the truth about Him is the most vital need of the hour. It is service of lasting benefit to them. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s judgments are righteous, and the execution thereof is done in righteousness. Those who are his servants and who have his spirit do not mourn the destruction of the wicked at the hand of the Lord’s appointed executioner. Their destruction is in vindication of Jehovah’s name, which name the wicked have despised, blasphemed and reproached. At such vindication all His servants rejoice. Though God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, he does not mourn their destruction, and he instructs his faithful servants not to mourn. They have been duly warned. Their blood is on then<sup>1</sup> own heads. Those who have faithfully given the testimony and warning are clear and innocent of all blood thus shed.

His protection as a glory is over them. They must maintain integrity to God under the crucial test unto the end if they would enter into the heavenly glory reserved for them. Demonized religionists seek to bring about the destruction of these children by causing them to break faith with God and to let go their integrity and to violate their covenant with God. With some like Judas the religionists succeed, and thus take away for ever from these unfaithful children their worthiness to Jehovah’s reserved glory. (Mic. 2:9) A remnant do hold fast their integrity like Job. The glory of Jehovah is risen upon them, and they continue to shine as his witnesses and at the last inherit the promised glory.—Isa. 60:1.

The Lord’s “faithful and wise servant” counts it an honor to declare such judgments and to be associated with Christ Jesus, who shall execute those judgments upon the enemy. The servant class have boldness in this day of judgment. (1 John 4: 17, 18) They are filled with might, being strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. They have understanding of their relationship to Jehovah and his Theocracy, and therefore have strength. (Prov. 8:14) They glory in the might of no man, but in Jehovah. (Jer. 9:23) They keep covenant with God by fulfilling their commission, being “filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; . . . strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power”.—Col. 1: 9-11.

According to the prophecies, neither shall win complete victory, and organized religion will deal with both “kings”, recognizing both as the “higher powers”, and will herself seek to dominate them both as a super-national spiritual government. Religion and rulers will allow no place for Jehovah’s message nor for his Theocracy. Such vain imaginations and wicked devices will not stand. Their final end shall be at God’s appointed time, at Armageddon. They are now in their last days, and Jehovah establishes his capital organization in power and glory. It stands for ever.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah by Christ Jesus will issue to the “great multitude” the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. They shall marry and reproduce righteous offspring, and then the righteous shall spring as the grass to ever beautify the earth. The remnant during the remainder of their sojourn on earth shall be in the midst of these righteous ones “as dew”. Such heavenly refreshment does not depend upon human creatures, but must be accepted as God provides. Doubtless, the remnant, together with the “princes”, will be used to further tender to the Lord’s “other sheep” his then “meat in due season”, including the proclamation of the divine mandate to that “great multitude”. This will be very exhilarating, like dew on parched grass. The remnant tarry not for a permit from any man to carry the Lord’s refreshment to others.

The remnant yet on earth of the faithful followers of the new world’s King, and their companions, will witness the fight for that world, but will not take part in it with violence to the enemies. The fight for the new world will be won without man’s help. Jehovah requires willing obedience, self-sacrificing devotion, and faithfulness with joyfulness on the part of all who will have his protection during Armageddon and enter into life on earth under the New World conditions. Such prove their good-will toward Jehovah and his kingdom by accepting the message at the hands of his witnesses. Then they forsake this “present evil world” and consecrate their lives to him and the service of his Righteous Government for evermore.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.—Heb. 11:2,3.</span></p>

The new world did not begin to appear in Abel’s day; he did not discern the physical facts of its establishment then. What he did have was God’s word. Abel’s faith helped him to appreciate God’s word and to frame and adjust in his mind and heart the vision of the new world which shall last for the ages, or forever. This frame of that new world was based solely upon God’s word, so that what Abel saw with the eye of faith was not based on any circumstantial facts appearing in his day. This faith helped him to be a faithful witness for God and to keep a clean and good report or record of integrity toward God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 34 1</span></p>

Following His word of instruction, the petitioner will not pray amiss. Jehovah is the Heavenly Father of every faithful one who is in the way of life and who is in a covenant for membership in the kingdom of heaven. It is the Father’s name Jehovah that must be hallowed. Because of the reproaches religion has heaped upon that holy name, it must be vindicated before all creation. The Kingdom will do that. It will clear out all religion and religious practitioners from heaven and earth. In place thereof it will cause God’s will to be done on earth by all creatures that live.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah in his mercy to the remnant of his elect ones shortened the tribulation in 1918. (Matt. 24:21,22) He did this that these might be recovered from their iniquity of lip and the uncleanness of the fear of men and might serve him anew as his witnesses and thereby receive salvation from God. At Armageddon Jehovah will renew the battle and bring the final end of the tribulation upon all the enemy crowd visible and invisible. During this shortening of the days in the middle of the tribulation period Jehovah sends forth his remnant, whose iniquity he pardoned. These, having received such great mercy, show mercy to others in danger of destruction. They publish to all having hearing ears His kingdom message of salvation, warning those in danger to flee from religion. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Every creature on earth that desires to get into the way of life must expect to face the same requirements and to follow the same rule of action. Willing obedience and faithfulness are required in doing the will of the great Life-giver. The creature must deal with righteousness and in the love of mercy toward others, especially those in the way of life with him. He must walk obedient to God’s expressed will and not abandon God’s side for the world’s. Thus he maintains his relationship with God. The joyful fulfilling of God’s requirements leads to endless life amid blessings unspeakable. Refusal or failure to carry out his requirements leads to death and loss of everything.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus feared to displease Jehovah, and he taught and himself illustrated obedience to God rather than to men. Hence to him there came the Father’s voice from heaven: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (Matt. 17: 5) His faithful remnant and his “other sheep” will therefore wisely do what he tells them to do; “because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” Following his example is the way to have the divine pleasure taken in one, and hence to receive the loving-kindness of God. The Lord God may permit his faithful and true witnesses to suffer long and keenly as in Job’s case. In his well-ordered time God will show them his mercy as he did to Job for keeping his integrity. He never disappoints the hope of those who sound forth his praises. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Chastening of God’s servants is for their profit, that they might be “partakers of his holiness”, complete devotion to righteousness with no compromise with the enemy. (Heb. 12:7,10) Jehovah deals with his covenant people as an organization. Uis chastening comes upon the organization, and the innocent must likewise endure the wholesome chastening. Daniel and his three companions were carried off captive to Babylon with the other Israelites that had come short of their covenant. Daniel did not excuse himself from the sin of his people, nor did he receive an earlier deliverance from Babylonish captivity. He waited upon God’s deliverance of all the remnant of His organization. (Daniel 9) The purpose is to purge out the undesirable ones who are without integrity toward God. Jehovah now has a chastened and purged organization maintaining integrity toward Him.

<p><span class="font6">It is the individual burden of every servant of the Lord to consider where and when it is the occasion and time to apply the Lord’s instruction. In that connection the Lord mentioned ‘going over the cities’, thereby meaning that there is other territory to be reached and covered. Therefore the servant should proceed where the door is still open and there is a possibility of “other sheep” to be hunted and found. It is not a running away in fear, nor from a mere threat of violence, but is a turning away from an unworthy city or some section of a city as one would from an unworthy house and leaving it to its destiny. (Vss. 14,15) This is a following of the Lord’s leading and going where more work can be done. Were it a case of trying to avoid persecution, then the witness would quit the work and not take up the same work elsewhere and facing like persecution.

<p><span class="font6">At the actual establishment of The Theocratic Government in 1914 and the coming of its King to Jehovah’s temple in 1918 there must come all-round improvement in the earthly part of God’s organization. There must be a taking away of all that which the King at the temple judges to be religious wood, hay, and stubble, which do not stand the fire of divine judgment. That which is durable, approved and precious to the Lord must be brought in. All confusion and controversies within must be done away with, and right order must be set up, that peace, prosperity and righteousness may prevail in the organization.

That Government is not made with human hands or votes. It is called “Mount Zion” and is the capital part of Jehovah’s universal organization. It is His royal family of sons, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. It is composed of 144,000 and One members, the One being the Head and the 144,000 being the members of “his body”. They together constitute a “kingdom of priests”, a “holy nation”, and are likened to a glorious temple adorning a mountaintop, as the temple at Jerusalem was builded by King Solomon on top of Mount Moriah.

Sound the Lord’s merciful warning to those about to die at Armageddon if unaided. Make return-visits upon those slow to understand but willing. Warn the honest and sincere against religion. Aid the refugees to find the Lord’s “city of refuge” for protection against God’s Executioner at Armageddon and to abide there and keep the rules, within the city bounds, in integrity. (Num. 35:11-28) Do good to Jehovah’s witnesses, the “least of these [Christ’s] brethren”, and do not take advantage of the war conditions to vent religious spleen on them for keeping God’s law and exposing religion.

They have God’s word for it, and know they shall see the desire of their eyes in the vindication of Jehovah’s name by the destruction of all who reproach it. (Ps. 92:11) By the revelation of the prophecies they now see Babylon, of which “Christendom” is the chief visible part, as Satan’s organization. “Christendom” has tried to mask her identity and ensnare the peoples, but God’s Word has exposed her and now all persons of good-will behold her to be what she actually is. Like wicked Queen Jezebel shall “Christendom” and all the enemy organization be debased to the lowest and trodden under the hosts of Jehovah’s organization.

All such, honestly examining the Creator’s promises and descriptions and acts concerning that new world, are led to love it. That is like Jehovah God. He too loves it and has proved his love for it. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” In those words, at John 3:16, the Son explained why he was on the earth as a perfect man, preaching the coming establishment of a new world under a new government, “the kingdom of heaven.” This spells the doom of the present world now in the throes of “distress of nations, with perplexity”.

<p><span class="font6">To gain final victory God’s covenant people must have centralized authority to do the deciding for them as to war strategy and plans of action against religion and totalitarian encroachments. Jehovah’s witnesses have carefully examined the Bible record. They see that when the typical Theocracy was in power over and was submitted to by Israel, Jehovah raised up his faithful judge, fought their battles, and gave them victory over all enemies in vindication of His own name. From the days of Abraham onward, all Godgiven victories were victories of Theocracy over Satan’s world organization. Now, in 1943 and hereafter, under the same banner of “Theocracy” can victory be gained for God’s witnesses. They pray that Christ Jesus put Theocratic rule in effect over them in the fight against religion and to maintain holy ground against totalitarian aggressions.

<p><span class="font6">From the binding obligation and responsibility to act as God’s ordained ministers there can never be any withdrawal, nor may his covenant people ever feel that after a period of work and because of advancing years they have done their share in God’s service and they may retire to ease and inactivity and enjoy a pension. Paul the apostle spoke of himself as “Paul the aged”. When so speaking he was not retired on a pension to let others do the work, but was a prisoner in chains at Rome for having kept on preaching and witnessing from house to house in obedience to his divine commission. (Philem. 9,10) To quit preaching and being a witness, because of persecution or any other selfish reason, this side of Armageddon’s fight means to be unfaithful to one’s ordination or commission and is a breaking of one’s covenant to do God’s will.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: hut he that regardeth reproof is prudent.—Prov. 15:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If one becomes imbued with the thought that he is singled out to do a certain and a great work and he proceeds upon that theory, he thus shows himself to be a fool. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” Such fool does not say this in words uttered by his mouth, but by his course of action he shows that his motive is to ignore God. He does not have in mind that God has put in his organization his creatures as it pleases him, and that those who are of that organization are taught, not by men, but by Jehovah and by Christ Jesus. (1 Cor. 12:18; Isa. 30: 20; 54:13) Such selfish person disregards the instructions of Jehovah and Christ Jesus and pursues a course of lawlessness or “iniquity”. He disregards what God gives his people through Christ Jesus at the temple, and in place thereof he sets forth his own wisdom, speaking of a great work that he as a man is delegated to do. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">These be the days of vengeance.—Luke 21:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The followers of Christ Jesus in the day of God’s vengeance have a work to do in connection with the expression of his vengeance. That work is, as their commission states, to 'declare the day of vengeance of our God’. (Isa. 61:2) Jehovah in his Word declares his vengeance against all defamers of his name, but that He will do the executing. Psalm 149: 8, 9 also says that all the saints shall have part in executing the judgment, in this: that they have part in binding the wicked ones by declaring the judgments of Jehovah already written. His servants must do the part assigned to them, which part is to boldly proclaim his purpose as expressed in his Word. Jehovah caused his prophets of old to declare and write down the judgments. These judgments written his faithful witnesses must now make known, by declaring to all hearers God’s purpose of executing such judgments. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.—Ps. 75: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah decides which organization shall be exalted to the head of His universal organization, and also which organization shall be abased unto hell or destruction. Zion is His organization of integrity, of which Christ Jesus is the Chief One or Head and of which organization all other members must follow in his footsteps and must like him maintain their integrity to God even unto death. It is a tried and faithful organization, and inseparably devoted to “holiness unto Jehovah”. Therefore the Supreme Judge, Jehovah, promotes Zion to be the capital organization of his universe, “angels and authorities and powers being made subject” thereunto. (1 Pet. 3:22) On the other hand, he declares his purpose to shortly level to the dust the unfaithful enemy organization of the demons under Satan.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word.—Acts 4:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persecution began upon those Christians without the visible presence of their Leader, Christ Jesus, in their midst. Instead of scattering them in confusion and fear, this unified them and stirred them to greater boldness, even as it required boldness to continue preaching. (2 Thess. 1:3,4) Also they “put on more steam” in the witness work. The official persecution that continued upon them thereafter did not embarrass them into inactivity or frighten them into a failure to carry out their ordination to preach. They considered it no disgrace to keep on witnessing under official disapproval. (Acts 5:41,42) Persecution there met a signal defeat, when Jehovah’s witnesses declared: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” On they went with the regular public and house-to-house witnessing.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And he bare the sin of many.—Isa. 53:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus faithfully endured the hardships and the assaults of demons and men. He refused to turn back from the service God assigned to him as Sin-Bearer, or even look back. Because he did not break covenant, turn back and so leave humankind without hope in sin under Satan’s organization, Christ Jesus died, apparently forsaken of God, and hoisted on a tree at the violent hands of dupes of “Azazel” and his demons. Therefore Jehovah lets the sins of those who will inherit the new world be dismissed without requiring of them the penalty of everlasting death for their sins, because they repent and turn to Jehovah and his Theocracy under Christ. Such sins become as if swallowed up in a solitary wilderness. All this is because of what has been done in fulfillment of the picture of the sacrificed Lord’s goat and the sin-bearing “goat for Azazel”. —Lev. 16: 8.

<p><span class="font6">Schemers for world domination do not pause to consider those words of the Leader in Christianity. He has come into his Kingdom, beginning A.D. 1914, and in the big fight at Armageddon he will reward the planners and battlers for world domination with destruction of their souls as enemies of Jehovah’s new world. They have fallen victims to the very enticement that the god of this wicked world held out to the Son of man as the price for his worship of the Devil. In meeting the searching test the Son of man put the worship of Jehovah God foremost as all-important. He brushed the outward glories of this world and its commercial domination aside as contemptible. Note this Perfect One’s stand, which stand is right: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God.”—4:10.

<p><span class="font6">Equally so, Jehovah’s faithful remnant and their companions will hold fast to The Theocracy. They will down to the last gain victory over the “beast” and his “image” and over the “mark” of such anti-Theocracy powers. The Lord’s “strange work” will without successful interruption be carried through to the finish. The Kingdom gospel will be preached down to the final end. The Lord’s “other sheep” will be hunted out and gathered every one to the side of salvation at the King’s right hand. At the finish thereof, the desolating abomination, at its last border and on its way out, will act against the ambassadors of The Theocracy. But it will be too late. Jehovah’s “strange work” by his Greater Jephthah will have succeeded over opposition. It will be all done. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, . . . The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them.—Ps. 34:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord must let justice have its righteous course at Armageddon. The religionists and their allies have behaved themselves as “goats” against the least of Christ’s brethren who proclaim The Theocracy, and they are gathered to his left side of disfavor. He therefore hides his face of grace and pity from them. The Lord has given them ample warning. Now he directs his faithful servants to tend his “other sheep” and comfort all of good-will that mourn. The faithful know that the present persecution upon them is not a sign that Jehovah has hid his face from them, but is permitted as a test of their integrity toward Him and his Theocratic Government. They therefore endure with joyfulness and hold fast their integrity. Continuing to do so, they are ‘^blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ”.—1 Cor. 1:8.

<p><span class="font6">By virtue of consecration to God and their covenant with him to do his will, and by virtue of the anointing of His spirit, Jehovah’s witnesses are his ordained ministers of the gospel and arc under instruction and command from him to preach “all the counsel of God”, and that whether religionists hear or forbear to hear. No creature or organization of creatures has the right or authority, because God’s message docs not please or agree with such, to command Jehovah’s witnesses to keep silence, and then try to enforce them into silence by restraining them from contact with others who desire to hear. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are “the Higher Powers”, and their commandments are prior to and superior to those of men and organizations on the earth.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; his understanding is infinite.—Ps. 147:5, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His covenant people are persuaded that his infinite understanding grasps every detail of his “strange work” in which they have a part. He understands every part of his organization of his witnesses, understands all their perplexities, understands all their trials and sufferings at enemy hands, and knows how to handle them wisely and competently for his name’s sake and its vindication. There is nothing the enemy attempt or do that He does not understand, even before their wicked plans are completed. As his courageous servants push ahead against nasty interferences concertedly springing up in all quarters, and as they carefully and anxiously look to what can be done to keep on going, He has never failed to guide them and to out-maneuver their enemies with His perfect understanding and attention to the bewildering mix-up of details. His work must go through. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">~W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.—Mic. 5:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rulers refuse to acknowledge Christ as their judge. Instead, they “give their kingdom unto the beast”, unto the “abomination of desolation” on which the great whore of religion sits. With their scepter or rod of power they persecute Jehovah’s witnesses who proclaim the judicial decisions of Christ Jesus. Thus doing to Christ’s brethren, to silence them, if possible, they show insulting contempt for Christ and thereby “smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek”. He does not turn the other cheek and stop the proclamation of Jehovah’s judgments; nor do the remnant and their companions on earth do so. The blow on the cheek fills them with righteous indignation and stirs up in them greater bitterness against religion and greater zeal in active worship and service of Jehovah and his Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And beside this, giving all diligence, add ... to patience godliness.—2 Pet. 1: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful remnant must strictly conform to Jehovah’s “gospel scheme” or “gospel purpose and procedure”. As an example to them Christ Jesus conformed to it and kept his integrity, and he was justified in spirit or declared of God to be perfectly right in his spirit toward God his Father. “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(Strong’s)</span><span class="font6"> the mystery of the gospel scheme]; he who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels [after his resurrection and ascension to heaven], preached among the nations [after the spirit’s outpouring at Pentecost], believed on in the world [by those forsaking this world], received up in glory [at the birth of The Theocracy in 1914].” (1 Tim. 3:16, A.Zf.V.) He was perfected in obedience to God by suffering. Likewise must the remnant who have the Lord’s spirit be thus perfected before they finish their course.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be not ye the servants of men.—1 Cor. 7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the most vital field of all, worship of God upon which everlasting life depends, there only do Jehovah’s people clad in the armor of God resist the aggressions of the totalitarian-minded ones into the things which must be rendered to God and which are his. They know that to spread and increase the knowledge of God is for the benefit of the people. They know the demons are back of totalitarian regimentation that makes men ignore God’s ways. Therefore they battle, not with flesh and blood, but with the power and rule of the demons who would cause destruction of the nations by opposition to God. Jehovah’s witnesses maintain their unity of action. Under the leadership of Him who bought them they rise up in a united front against the aggressor and hurl him back. They resist all forms of demonism, and no more does religion gain a foothold among them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall take a censer full of burning coals . . . and bring it within the veil: and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not.—Lev. 16:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fiery coals symbolized the live, active zeal of Christ Jesus, which burned for his Father’s house and was also destructive of religion that reproached God’s name. The carrying of sweet incense with fiery coals within the veil into the Holiest of all pictured Jesus’ course on earth in behalf of God’s house and against religion, in order that Jehovah in heaven might be well pleased as by fragrance. This action preceded the sprinkling of blood for the sin-atonement. Hence it pictured Christ Jesus pleasing God by zealously maintaining his integrity for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Vindication of God’s name is more important than and takes precedence over sacrifice for redemption of human creatures. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This is clearly a religious “shot” at Jehovah’s witnesses, to make out that they are liars and false prophets in declaring the day of God’s vengeance and that the battle of Armageddon is very near and there “Christendom” will be completely blotted out. Regardless of ridicule by religionists, Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to sound his warning and bid the people of good-will to hasten their flight out of the doomed organization, lest they be overtaken in its destruction. Religion’s “refuge of lies” and “hiding place of falsehood” are now being exposed by the hail and overflowing waters of truth, and will furnish religionists no protection or preservation when the God of justice settles accounts, shortly.

<p><span class="font6">Conditions now require that Jehovah’s commissioned people and their companions follow diligently the hunter’s example. For several years Jehovah has had in effect his Theocratic organization and has been training and instructing them for this very work. They have been assigned each one his territory in the field. They must not permit their attention to be drawn away, but be constant in doing the one thing, knowing what they are seeking for. They must walk circumspectly, ever ready to use the Lord’s equipment provided for this late day, and must act and work together in absolute unity. Thus the Lord God, who sends them forth, will uncover the creatures upon whom he has set his eyes. The Lord knows where they are and how to reach them, and he will not let his hunters stalk around fruitlessly. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

Now in this day of crisis upon “Christendom” Jehovah’s voice again cries to that “city” or religious organization which claims the name of Christ. Again it is not the “voice” of creatures, not the voicing of human opinions by Jehovah’s witnesses, that “Christendom” hears, but these cry out to her what the voice of the Lord has said in his Word. She is now on judgment, because the Lord has come to his temple and is present as Judge. Never in history was there such a loud, widespread cry of His voice. This cry was made through his faithful witnesses and their devoted companions. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

They are not yet made “princes in all the earth” under The Theocratic Government, but the truth and mercy God expressed to Jacob and Abraham He has fulfilled. The oath with which he swore to the fathers of Christ Jesus from the days of old he has kept inviolate. His mercy, truth and faithfulness are upheld and shall shortly at Armageddon be completely vindicated. The Theocratic Government is here, it having begun with Jehovah’s enthronement of the King thereof in A.D. 1914. Out of his loving-kindness, hence his mercy, Jehovah made provision for this wonderful Government that shall extend his mercy to sinful creatures who desire to come into harmony with him to live eternally to His glory.

<p><span class="font6">Religionists made false accusation and used disturbed world conditions as a subterfuge to stop the “Elijah work” of Jehovah’s servants. There the modern Philistines sheared the Samson class of their locks and weakened their strength to serve God boldly and freely. But Samson’s locks grew again and he rose again in Jehovah’s service to his greatest exploit against religion. Likewise by devoting themselves to keeping the covenant-obligations upon their heads, as symbolized by Samson’s regrown hair, and by being blinded to all else than God’s “strange work” against religion, the faithful remnant have arisen, in the strength of Christ their Head. Jehovah has delivered them from restraint due to fear of men and of worldly ruling organizations. He has commanded them to arise to his service with courage and boldness.

<p><span class="font6">That means till the door-to-door work is useless because there are no people in the houses to answer your doorbell ringing, because God has wiped out all who have refused to heed his message by his witnesses; and the cities that mischievously framed laws and mobbed you out of town have suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Matt. 10:13-15) Here, then, is the “Go ahead” signal from the Highest Authority to keep going on in his “strange work” of witness no matter what happens before Armageddon comes and desolates the earth of the “goat” class. Fear not what may stare you in the face. The Lord’s spirit upon you He will not remove; that power will stay with you and bring you off more than conquerors.

<p><span class="font6">Due to her rebellious conduct toward Him and his Theocracy under Christ, Jehovah will not save “Christendom”. Jehovah, according to his promise, saves only a remnant of true spiritual Israelites who become his official witnesses. Besides these he saves the persons of good-will who heed the witness and join the remnant as companions in service. His primary purpose is not to save mere human creatures who have no rightful claim upon him, but is to vindicate his name. Therefore he says to those who reject him and turn to other gods for salvation: “Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.” (Judg. 10:14) Regardless of what choice creatures make Jehovah will vindicate his own name and prove He is the only God and Deliverer, and Christ Jesus is his Savior for those who seek the new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

Satan would make the peoples believe that life in peace and happiness depends upon his organization and proceeds through and is sustained and protected by his organization. Now that demon organization rapidly nears its final end. In the desperation to either rule or ruin Satan sets up requirements whereby creatures may live under his organization and which requirements they must meet or else be killed. His decree is that none shall survive save those worshiping his beastly organization and having its mark in the forehead or the hand. Contrary to the rules of Jehovah he forces regimentation upon the people. In reality, Jehovah is the Fountain of life and salvation.

<p><span class="font6">Many now join in and swell the “Hallelujah” song, blending their voices in perfect unity with the remnant of spiritual Israel. These become the Lord’s “other sheep”. They know from God’s Word that the chief work and calling of the remnant is to give a witness to Jehovah in vindication of His name, and that this “one thing” the remnant must do. There are not two things, including a different commission for the “other sheep”. Hence nothing these dear “sheep” could do could take pre-eminence over what is the ordained chief work of the remnant. Therefore the “other sheep” must be the remnant’s active companions in doing the “one thing” of bearing witness to the truth concerning Jehovah and his Kingdom. Thus these “other sheep” become witnesses for Him, on the same wise that the faithful men before Christ’s death were the never-quitting witnesses for Jehovah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This inspired prayer thus petitioning God shows that God’s retributive action in for ever settling the account with the persecutors will be primarily to settle the issue of his universal domination. In the fiery furnace of persecution Jehovah’s witnesses, like Jeremiah, pray to Him: “0 Lord, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.” Jehovah God gives his trusting ones the assurance that the persecution shall fail and that they shall share in His vindication, saying: “I will make thee unto this people [persecutors] a fenced brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee.”—Jer. 15:15, 20.

<p><span class="font6">The emptying himself of this heavenly power and position was not part of the sin-offering, but was part of his proving perfect obedience to his Father. It was in order that the Son might become a perfect man and maintain his integrity toward his Father under the most crucial test and thereby provide Jehovah’s complete answer to Satan’s lie. This would be for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and would prove the Son to be worthy to be Head of Jehovah’s capital organization and as such the Vindicator of God’s name. Thus viewed, the chief purpose of God’s beloved Son in becoming a perfect man was, not to provide redemption for humankind, but to bear witness to Jehovah’s name and new government and to vindicate His name. —John 18: 37, 36.

It was a joyful task for her because it was coupled with God’s vindication and preservation of free worship in Israel by her father’s whipping the demonized invaders just two months previous. Weeping and bewailing were all now things definitely of the past and no more to be bothered with. From now on only the joyful service of God for her! Equally so, the “other sheep” put sorrowing aside and yield themselves up to the Greater Jephthah, Christ Jesus, the Head over all those who put themselves under The Theocratic Government for refuge and protection, to do to them and for them all that his word of promise foretold as recorded in the Bible.

Jephthah’s determination was that God’s rule should not be forsaken after the crisis had passed. With God’s covenant people today it must be The Theocratic Government and its visible organization first, last, and all the time, both before Armageddon and forever after. As with Jephthah’s selection, so it has been with the Watch Tower Society. The Society did not select itself to be the visible part of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization on earth, but the Lord God, by Christ Jesus, did so.

It was His holy name and universal domination that were at stake, and it was for this that God took the action that brought in his only begotten Son. Righteousness meant the vindication of His name, and it must be righteousness that must be restored universally. His universal domination meant the universal rule of righteousness; for his domination is a righteous one. It was his love of the world of righteousness, and not mere mortal humans, that moved God. Because of his devotion to righteousness, and in the interest of righteousness everywhere, Jehovah purposed the creating of the new world consisting of the “new heavens” and the “new earth”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 117 fl 1, 118 fl 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">That prophecy denotes a great contest between the power of darkness and the power of light. The power of darkness cannot prevent that Kingdom light of Jehovah from piercing through the gross darkness and reaching the religion-blinded persons of good-will and healing their eyes of understanding that they may see the way of escape from the ditch that lies ahead in the darkness. Those who have long groped in darkness of religion have difficulty for some time in adjusting their eyes of understanding to the light. However, the light is Jehovah’s light, and there is healing in its beams. There can be only one result to the continual, steady, persistent shining of that light. “Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: . . . they come to thee.”— Vs. 4.

Hence the nations will never have peace with God nor time to learn the arts of peace, but shall go down fighting against Jehovah and his Theocracy. Those preserved during Armageddon will never learn war, either against one another or against The Theocracy. Why? Because Satan and the demons will be restrained, and the “Prince of Peace” will rule. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Jesuitized Catholic Action will be gone. Totalitarian dictators and the anti-God “abomination of desolation” will be gone. Religion will be gone. Worship of Jehovah will be carried out by all that live. Politicians will be gone, and The Theocracy’s visible representatives on earth, the faithful men of old, as “princes” will rule in judgment.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah acknowledges The Theocratic Government as his own. He is the source of its life and power, and he by his spirit begets each one who gains office in that Theocracy. It is therefore his offspring and is pictured under the symbol of a perfect &quot;man child”. The Head of that Government is Christ Jesus, who is called “The Son of man”. All members of that Theocratic Kingdom being first taken out from God’s universal organization, such organization is the “mother” of the “man child” Government and is pictured as a pure and devoted “woman”, whose maker, Jehovah, is her husband. (Isa. 54: 5) The entering in by Christ Jesus upon the active duties of the Government is therefore pictured as the woman’s giving birth to the “man child”.

<p><span class="font6">For a long while religionists have lived wantonly, using their ill-gotten gains for their own sensual pleasure. God announces his purpose to destroy their institutions and those who have built them up. But, say the opponents of God’s Kingdom, why say anything about these things now? Because Jehovah has commanded his witnesses to declare the day of his vengeance upon those who have defamed his name and taken his name in vain, to the end that the people may be warned of their approaching doom, and that those of good-will who have been held in subjection to those practieers of fraud may have opportunity to flee to God and to Christ.

The remnant and the Lord’s “other sheep” will not waste time trying to do such a thing, thereby deceiving themselves into such an anti-Christ effort. They will do as the great High Priest Christ Jesus left them the example to do. Instead of trying to get the world’s approval and appear respectable to it, they will abandon Satan’s organization and go forth to Christ Jesus “without the camp” and bear his reproach in the wilderness of this world by being witnesses for Jehovah and his kingdom.

Shall we obey God or totalitarian-Fascist statesmen? There will be no escaping complete destruction for those who reject God and obey men.

Jehovah’s great Vindicator, the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek, has come to the temple and hence The desire of all nations has come’. Therefore in the representative capacity of his Christ, “Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him” and hear the testimony He has commanded his witnesses to deliver.

It is a “strange work” to them, and they do not believe its purpose, but impute evil motives to it. They seek to keep the strayed and scattered sheep subject to their selfish uses and exploitation. The time for the gathering is soon up; there is no time to be lost now by those whom the Lord graciously uses on earth in the gathering work. It requires unity of action and a co-ordinating of operations by all those engaged therein and a use of all the means and ways God has provided for the work. It calls for a careful combing of territory and a diligent searching of the isolated and scattered places where sheep are not associated in a company but are dispersed, knowing not whither to go.

<p><span class="font6">That the primary issue before all creation is world domination is proved by the enemy organization’s taunt. Babylon made war upon the typical Theocracy, overthrew the unfaithful religious organization, also took captive the remnant faithful to the Theocracy and then reproached their God, saying, “Where is the Lord thy God ?” In other words, Who is supreme now, your God Jehovah, or our god, Satan the Devil? For his name’s sake Jehovah gave effective answer in delivering and releasing his remnant in 1919 and thereafter giving through them the most far-reaching testimony to his name, in the teeth of the greatest persecution and opposition. Such has been that the enemy might be warned that at Armageddon it will be Jehovah that smites them in proof of his supremacy. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

That demonized human institution will be the final and complete expression of the antichristian “abomination of desolation”, opposed to the universal domination of The Theocracy. It assumes to “stand in the holy place” instead of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ. That ‘desolating abomination’ can never boost itself to take the place and power of the high Theocracy of Jehovah’s anointed King. It shall be abased unto hell.

Like Jephthah’s daughter, the Lord’s “other sheep” are the only earthly class out of all this present generation to show favor to the Jephthah class, whom Jesus called “the least of these my brethren”. Jephthah’s daughter by coming forth first to greet him automatically imposed a great responsibility and service upon herself, of which she was possibly not aware if she had not heard of Jephthah’s vow. Likewise the joyful welcoming of the Theocratic organization for its triumphs in Jehovah’s name puts a great responsibility and service obligation upon the Lord’s “other sheep” or “ Jephthah’s daughter” class.

(Matt. 10:16) They try to trap Jehovah’s “sheep” into a course of compromise, fornication with the world, where He will reject and destroy them. The persecutors, though, shall fall into the trap and themselves be destroyed by Jehovah’s Executioner. They simply prepare destruction for themselves. Their plea of defending religion will not justify their hatred and opposition to Jehovah and troubling his witnesses. “The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.”—Vss. 7-9.

He had faith in its records of Jehovah’s judgments successfully executed against all enemies. For the victory over Sihon Jephthah’s words gave the credit to Jehovah. Jehovah’s part in the battle was the important thing; it was His victory and conquest. Nothing stopped Him in establishing his worship in the land then; nothing will stop his establishing it through the whole earth now. Christ Jesus, who refused to worship Satan, is now King of the earth. With him in office it must be, Out with religion! He, as God’s agent, will establish Jehovah’s worship over all the earth.

(Rev. 22:16; Num. 24:17) The remnant of his body members must likewise shine, reflecting his light of the Kingdom, and they do so in obedience to God’s command, and turn many to God’s righteous Government.

Any other course on the part of his covenant people would be disobedience and covenantbreaking and would be punishable with destruction.

Therefore, for his name’s sake, which stands for justice and righteousness, and for the help and avail of lovers of righteousness that such might live forever, Jehovah arranged for atonement by a sin-offering. Helpless man born of the rebel Adam could not make atonement; hence it lay with Jehovah to make atonement by his perfect and only begotten Son, who became the “man Christ Jesus”. It has been said that God does not love the sin but loves the sinner. That is not Scripturally true. God’s love is for the new world of righteousness, and only those who desire and avail themselves of God’s provision to live in that righteous world God brings under his love.

He breaks their stubborn pride and disdain, their stiff, unbending backs, and then lets his faithful servants put their feet upon the necks of these as they bite the bitter dust in death. They will be forced to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the proof of his supremacy and universal domination, and be compelled to admit such before their destruction. “As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” (Rom. 14:11) Those doing so unwillingly shall perish.

Looking at its constant course through all centuries every honest person must admit that religion is of this world and takes part in this world’s organization. Therefore religion shall perish for ever with this old world, by Jehovah’s “strange act”, which is the primary reason why his act is strange to religionists. Survey now what religion did to God’s chosen people of old, Israel, and the conclusion reached must be that the only way to survive is this: to immediately forsake religion and its confusion and take up the pure and undefiled worship of the great God of the new world, Jehovah.

The “other sheep” must receive life through him as their King-Father and be regenerated. He is God’s appointed Head of The Theocracy, and these “other sheep” must put themselves under the Theocratic organization, even as Jephthah’s daughter did. She recognized the Theocratic arrangement as in force and also the binding power of vows under it. She would not rob God by causing anything to be held back that was promised him. She stood for faithfulness to vows, no matter how it affected her, all because she looked up to Jehovah as the Supreme Power and recognized his Theocracy and its rules.—Num. 30:2. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

In Scripture the ox is a symbol of power and strength to work with endurance; the horn is a symbol of power to push against the enemy and destroy them. Christ Jesus is the Head of the “daughter of Zion” or Theocracy. At the time to thresh Satan’s organization his strength against the enemy is likened to that of a mighty ox against the dry grain stalks on the threshing floor.

<p><span class="font6">God shall completely vindicate his name and settle the outstanding issue of universal domination to the everlasting glory of his holy name. Seeing this concerning Jehovah’s name makes it clear what is essential for the person of good-will who sees or regards God’s name in His Word. He must devote himself to Jehovah God through Christ Jesus, the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and then must take Jehovah’s side in the great issue. There he must abide in integrity or blamelessness by faithfully witnessing to God’s name and purpose to the end, never compromising with religion, which is on the opposing side of the issue.

(Isa. 45:7) His beloved Son, who on earth was called “The Son of man”, is “The Prince of Peace”. At his human birth in Bethlehem the song of the angels foretold that when his Kingdom should be established God’s peace would be extended through this Prince to men of good-will on earth. Amid the tumult of the world that marks its end He only is the One by whom to gain peace of heart and mind and forever enjoy the peacefid earth after the great conflict for universal domination is fought and won to the vindication of Jehovah God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

Reproaches, persecutions and hardships at the hands of religionists can not take away from the real pleasantness of praising Jehovah and his desirable Government to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness.

(Matt. 24:14) The obedient and faithful remnant lift up this standard of the Kingdom that the people may discern the primary issue confronting all nations and may choose the side of life eternal.

<p><span class="font6">As in the case of great scattering of the Christians in the days of the apostles, so now. The scattered ones will go “every where preaching the word”, every one of them knowing the instructions to him from the Lord and every one understanding full well the Lord’s command above. Persecution and scattering puts each one on his individual own, to make manifest his individual choice and determination to do God’s will independently of what any or all other humans may or may not do. And as it was in the apostolic days, the Lord God by his angels frustrates the enemies and contrives to get communications through and to keep his faithful active servants in touch with “the Lord’s table” and his servant thereat. These faithful ones know the issues involved. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. —Rom. 14:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the Society the Lord has sent the testimony concerning Jehovah, his name and his Theocracy under Christ Jesus. By the Society He has carried on the witness work concerning The Theocracy and vindication of his name through that Government. Also by the Society he now conducts the organized fight against the aggressions of the religious-totalitarian monstrosity. Through the same Society he has brought back and reinstated among men the Theocratic rule and organization over consecrated persons in a covenant with the Most High God. This is not boasting, but an honest, humble statement of indisputable and well-known facts, all proving that Jehovah has laid his hands upon the Society and made it his visible representative of The Theocracy, and not by the expressed wish and request of creatures. The wise consider these facts and ponder their meaning. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land.—Jer. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many persons of good-will have heard the witness and followed after the faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites over the highway that leads to God’s organization, Zion, and have put themselves under its protection. Multitudes of these have already thus come to Zion and been brought into his temple to there serve God “day and night”. Many more will continue to come. In September, 1942, at 80 cities throughout the earth, these were plainly visible in great numbers as simultaneously they gathered there with the decreasing number of the remnant, in a New World Theocratic Assembly totaling in excess of 150,000 persons. This is all part of Jehovah’s “strange work”. It excites the wonder and malicious opposition of all nations. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out of Zion shall go forth the law.—Isa. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To God’s covenant people begotten of his spirit his law out of Zion is: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached.” To the ruling factors of the world His law has been fearlessly declared by his faithful witnesses since 1918: “Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish.” (Ps. 2:11,12, A.R.V.) The rulers, judges and clergy of the earth defy the law out of Zion and oppose The Theocratic Government and its proclamation. They shall miserably perish at the kindled wrath of the King at Armageddon. Jehovah’s faithful covenant people obey his law, even when demonized men mischievously frame laws to punish their obedience to God. The Lord’s “other sheep” learn and obey the divine law out of Zion, and serve with the remnant as witnesses to Jehovah and his Theocracy, and they take refuge in Christ Jesus, his King.

<p><span class="font6">Thus God’s covenant people may pray. Let them bear always in mind that as long as they are faithful to him and his name which they bear, and as long as they carry out his commission to them, their cause is God’s own cause. Let public officials pause and consider such truths before yielding to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists and before afflicting God’s faithful servants and thereby violating His command to the rulers: “Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.” (105: 13-15) Jehovah will plead against such violators at Armageddon with violent destruction upon them. Jehovah openly displays his witnesses to the light of public inspection as a “people for his name”. It is an open token of His rejection of the religionists. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font6"> 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully.—Jer. 23:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord does not say to speak the words of wisdom of man, nor to be influenced or guided by the word of man. It clearly appears that Jehovah by Christ Jesus is doing his work on earth among his people and hence is guiding his people in the right way according to his promise. (Prov. 3: 5, 6) The identity of the persons or individuals engaged in God’s service is not now material. For one to highly esteem men or for one himself to seek high esteem from men cannot be pleasing to the Lord. Such person could not receive the Lord’s blessings. Likewise the man who seeks to justify himself in the eyes of men that they might approve and honor him could not have the Lord’s favor in so doing. To suchlike Jesus said: “Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.”—Luke 16:15.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.—Heb. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ’s sin-offering is the ransom and is the allsufficient propitiation that needs no repeating. The good effects of his sin-atonement continue for ever, and all creatures that accept and prove worthy of the benefits thereof shall live in the new world. Jehovah’s “high priest after the order of Melchizedek” has come to reign, and not for any re-presenting of his sin-offering. He has done the required work, and all other creatures having hope of cleansing and redemption and deliverance must observe the “sabbath of rest” in Him and in what he has worked for them. The atonement day, long ago foreshadowed by Israel’s Theocracy, glorifies and makes prominent the Author of atonement for the new world, Jehovah God, and his High Priest thereof, Christ Jesus. “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.”—2 Cor. 9:15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gath-ereth not with me scattereth abroad.—-Matt. 12:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are indifferent to The Theocratic Government and making no decision are passive resisters to it, and they give comfort and aid thereby to the enemies of the Government. The King of The Theocracy is the One who stated the above strict, unbending rule. The time for indecision is past. The King spews out the lukewarm ones. (Rev. 3:16) Those who do not join the assembly to the Kingdom of God simply do not believe his Word. They do not consider his invitation worth the acknowledging. They thereby do not honor him or fear him or love his righteousness. If not found in the assembly, they must share the fate of all others outside who are actively fighting Jehovah’s Theocracy of everlasting life and peace. The flood of Noah’s day caught all those outside the ark.—Matt. 24: 37-39. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world.—Rev. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hour of temptation is upon all the world. The test is as to love for the old world that must perish at Armageddon or love for the Theocracy of God’s new world. In this time of test only those who hold fast to God’s Word and patiently follow its guidance will be held up from falling into the snare of the fear of man and demons and which snare brings death with the world. Tribulation can no longer be escaped by anyone on earth. But you must choose whether your tribulation shall be with the world as a part thereof or for The Theocracy and its righteousness. The tribulation of the world leads unto death, but maintaining your integrity under tribulation for the sake of The Theocracy means life in the glorious world of righteousness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 126 fl 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“Beth-ezel” means “near-by house”, that is, a neighbor, a stand-by or an ally, or organizations allied together. The alliance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy includes all the neighbor religionists of “Christendom”. When it comes to the showdown, these allies will be useless. Their mourning and lamentation will accomplish nothing. To be thus associated will be no advantage to the allies, because Jehovah’s Executioner will bring down mourning and disaster on the allies. None will be able to fall back and receive aid from or give support to the allies. Christ Jesus will execute all the enemies of God. These facts must now be known to those who love the Lord. For this reason he causes them to be made known, so that the man of God may be fully equipped for the war. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Now, with Armageddon immediately before us, it is a matter of life or destruction. Those who would be of the Lord’s “other sheep” that will compose the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors and live joyfully on earth forever must find the answer to this personal and very important question. How shall now one approach God with acceptance and get in the way of life ? Sacrifices without obedience are bribe tactics and are abominable to God. (Prov. 21: 27) “To obey is better than sacrifice.” (1 Sam. 15: 22) A mere material-sacrifice arrangement favors the rich as against the empty-handed poor. Such “sacrifices” are things outside of the individual himself and can become mere formality. Jehovah has told man His requirements. These man must do to live. 17 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.—Ps. 147:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s specific command to his servants is to declare his name throughout all the earth and to publish the Kingdom gospel to all nations. This work of publication and education of the people of good-will must be done before the final end of Satan’s organization. Therefore the work must be pressed daily with all one’s heart, mind, soul and strength, because it must be done quickly. To the accomplishment of this God has provided his Theocratic arrangement for his organized people; he has equipped them with his revealed Word in print, also with sound equipment. By these means, and with a small band of lively, fearless Kingdom publishers permeated with the zeal for Jehovah, God’s word has indeed run very swiftly and encircled the world since 1918. It continues to run. Millions are reading. “Let them read.” Other millions yet hear by means of sound equipment. 17 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it? . . . them will we possess.—Judg. 11:23,24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This sets the right example for God’s servants now. In 1918 he sent to the temple for judgment Christ Jesus. Every advancement since then in knowledge and understanding, and all progress toward pure and proper service of the Lord, has meant just that much of a pushing back of the power and forces of religion and a gaining of victory over religion. From all advanced positions thus attained the Lord’s servants may not draw back. To do so would be to yield ground to religionists and their allies. Jehovah is the One responsible for cleaning up his witnesses. He drove out religion and gave them mastery over that snare and racket. He brought them into the privileges of proclaiming the Kingdom gospel to the people as his ordained ministers. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They were all scattered abroad . . . except the apostles. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.—Acts 8:1,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visible headquarters (the apostles) kept together, by the Lord’s grace and protection, but the scattering of others of Jehovah’s witnesses caused only a spreading of the witness to parts not reached before. The scattered ones took joyfully the spoiling of their goods. (Heb. 10:34) They realized that wherever God’s providence permitted them to be scattered they must there be true to His commission to them as His witnesses, '‘preaching the word.” Being thus scattered, each individual was obliged to “bear his own burden”. (Gal. 6:5) However, each faithful individual the Lord used to accomplish an effective witness. This record shows how the persecution defeated its own ends and how all others of Jehovah’s witnesses in the future should carry on when subjected to like violent action and scattering. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah thus vowing pictured Christ Jesus, the heavenly Head of the visible part of Jehovah’s organization on earth. The vow is the expression of the Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus to this effect: Whatever class of persons gaining life by Christ’s sacrifice first comes out to greet as victor such organization under its Theocratic King, that very class shall be used for no selfish advantage nor to perpetuate any earthly creature’s name. It shall be rendered up fully and unreservedly to God for his service at his holy temple. This proves that Jehovah’s witnesses are not trying to get “joiners” or to build up an organization called by some human’s name or of any subversive nature.

<p><span class="font6">Only creatures who now set their love and confidence and hopes on the new world of God’s creation and who immovably take their stand for it and publicly confess thereto will be spared to enter into its joys, privileges and blessings. Now is the destiny-making time, the time to decide whether to work for the preservation of this wicked world, with certain disappointment in the end, or to serve the interests and prove oneself worthy of the new world with its endless joys that will outweigh all the sufferings for righteousness endured at present. God in his loving-kindness has made all needed provision whereby men who have been bom of the sinner race may escape the condemnation of death due to sin and may qualify for everlasting life, some in the “new heavens” of that new world, and a far larger number on a purified earth under those new heavens.

<p><span class="font6">The proclamation of the truth exposes those who practice demonism, particularly the religious clergy, and who defy God and are determined to rule or ruin. They feel embarrassment at the Theocratic message, and take shame. Hence their final aim is that Jehovah’s witnesses “shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame”. They threaten and order Jehovah’s witnesses: “Preach not!” God’s covenant people reply: “We ought to obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29); they keep on obeying him, preaching the same as hitherto and increasing their efforts, “putting on more steam,” though they suffer a jail sentence or mob violence or concentration camp or even a sentence to death. In this course they follow in the steps of Christ Jesus, who left them the right example. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The “new name”, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” is upon his covenant people, not being conferred by any president of the Society nor by any other man. True, they bear identification cards with the signature of the Society’s president, but such is merely to identify them to prove they are true representatives of the Society with its literature, and to set forth the terms of their commission from the Lord to preach his message. So they do not walk under authorization of some man’s name signed to a permit or license to go from house to house with the Kingdom message; nor do they ask such from dictator, police, or other worldly official. Their ordination and authorization to preach is from Jehovah, whose name is called upon them. In His name they are determined to walk for ever and ever, persecution notwithstanding. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The nations’ purpose is to regiment all people into worshiping Satan’s “beast” organization and by threats, force and punishments make them submit to the ‘mark of the beast and his image’. Thereby they hope specially to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and to coerce them to ‘touch the unclean thing’ by compromising with and taking part in the works of Satan’s organization. But the remnant and their companions know the issue is God’s supremacy and universal domination. They now refuse to violate their covenant with God and to cease from his worship and service. Their purpose is to prove Satan a liar and God true. Therefore they resist the demons and absolutely refuse to break integrity to God and be forced into playing the hypocrite.

<p><span class="font6">This is the day of judgment of “Christendom” and of all nations. Therefore Jehovah’s judgments must be declared against such. Since A.D. 1922 he has poured out his spirit of power, and his remnant have the ‘double portion of Elijah’s spirit’, and are filled with the boldness and fearlessness of the prophet Elisha. (2 Ki. 2: 9,15) They are blind to everything save The Theocracy. Like the blinded Samson, who pulled down the pillars of demonism, they are full of power by the Lord’s spirit to use the spiritual weapons of Christian warfare, which weapons are mighty through God to pull down strongholds of religion. Jehovah also puts his spirit upon his “other sheep”, the remnant’s companions, just as He put his spirit upon faithful men of old before Christ, to accomplish his will and his work through them.

<p><span class="font6">Though the separate destiny of each class is distinctly understood now, this has not split up the companionship of the spiritual, heaven-bound remnant yet on earth and their devoted companions, the “other sheep”, who will abide on earth and fulfill the divine mandate. They alike serve at God’s temple. They associate together, regularly, in Bible studies, in service meetings, and in general conventions, this to exhort one another regarding service for The Theocracy, and to hold fast their faithfulness, unflagging zeal, and unbreakable integrity for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. They rejoice together. They fight shoulder to shoulder under Jehovah’s mighty “Fighter for the new world”, Christ Jesus. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

They must continue to do so at present and until Armageddon clears out all traitors and false friends of the world. Jehovah never betrays the confidence and trust of those who rely on him. To look to and keep watching him, however, does not mean to let our powers and faculties lie idle and unused. It means to keep on fighting for The Theocracy and for our right and liberty to proclaim that Government. Use all the legal means still at your disposal for the gaining of and defense of freedom. But, over and above the legal provisions and qualifications, always ask for and be guided by and use the 'wisdom which comes down from above’ and which the Lord God gives liberally to all his covenant people that ask for it in faith. He will then direct the issue or way of escape.—1 Cor. 10:13. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is interested in a remnant of people and promises to do great things for them. Not that those of the remnant are important in themselves, but it is bo-cause they are Jehovah’s “remnant of his people” and he deals with them differently from his manner of action toward all worldly nations and peoples. The term “remnant” points to something greater of which the remnant are but a part remaining visible on earth. They are part of or are in line for Almighty God’s organization Zion, The Theocracy. Hence it is of exceeding value and importance to watch the movements of the remnant under Jehovah’s direction. Why? Because such are visible proofs to the eye that the heavenly Theocracy has come into power and rules. All creatures must submit themselves and render allegiance to it, if they would live for ever. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Gates open continually day and night signify freedom from fear of all enemies and that the angel guards are on the job. It means Jehovah’s “strange work” of ingathering will go on day and night by his publishers, and the refugees escaping to the Lord from all nations or Gentiles will steadily be brought in before His Chief Executioner destroys those outside, and that the enemy action will not close those gates to any fleeing there during this “day of salvation”. It is expected that Jehovah, shortly before Armageddon breaks, will grant the faithful men of old from Abel to John to be raised from the dead. Then without hesitation those future “princes in all the earth” will follow Zion’s light and enter in through the open gates to serve God.

<p><span class="font6">The King’s unchanging rule now applies: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matt. 19:17) Obedience to God’s law is the only way to life. The King on Zion showed to all the way of obedience, and he is “the way, and the truth, and the life”. He being God’s spokesman, “his name is called The Word of God.” (John 14: 6; Rev. 19:13) He having come to the temple, it follows that “the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem” shall go forth. Such is the “Holy Jerusalem”, which comes down from God out of heaven. (Rev. 21: 10) From Jehovah and through His King of the “holy Jerusalem” comes the wrnrd of the Lord, his message and doctrine to his servants who fear him and keep his commandments. That word announces the doom of religion and traditions of men. Through his capital organization God feeds his people. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Because the religionists and their supporters and hangers-on do not take seriously the message delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, the state of affairs today is as in the days of Noah. (Matt. 24: 37-39) They feast as did King Belshazzar right before his own death and Babylon’s overthrow; they intoxicate themselves with the things of Satan’s world, and this has become a “jazz” age, so called. Even the professed “Christian religionists” are now “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”. (2 Tim. 3:4) A desolate condition w<sup>r</sup>as foretold on Babylon, symbolizing Satan’s organization. (Rev. 18:21-24) Hence such pleasures and merrymaking are short-lived now.

She encroaches more and more upon the “pure worship” of God in spirit and in truth and regiments the people and threatens them witli penalties if they do not worship the “beast”. The purpose of her “image of the beast”, which image is also branded the “abomination of desolation”, is to desolate faith in and support of God’s kingdom and thereby to destroy the earthly interests of his kingdom. The purpose of the demons in this is to cause the desolating of the earth of its entire population at Armageddon, to prevent any from surviving and going over to the “new world” under God’s kingdom. “Christendom” must herself be desolated at Armageddon.

Praise ye Jehovah.—Ps. 147:19,20, A.R.V. </span><span class="font6">This places a tremendous responsibility on those of His “holy nation” and their companions, who share their blessings and accompanying responsibilities. There must be no slowdown; his word must yet run swiftly, for that is the statute and ordinance his devoted people must obey. The nations know not His word and Theocratic regulations, and will continue to oppose and persecute till Armageddon’s winter freezes them into everlasting inaction. Foreknowing this opposition to His word and its swift bearers, and aware of his mercies and favors to the remnant and companions, the Lord commands as his closing word: “Hallelujah !” that is, “Praise ye Jehovah!” It is his urgent call to his favored ones to action. The faithful spring to the response. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly. —Mie. 6:8, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As in Micah’s day, the spiritual Israelite actually in a covenant to do God’s will, and the man professedly so, should be and are most directly concerned about what the Lord requires. However, the Lord’s rule is the same toward the earthly ones of good-will who become the Lord’s “other sheep”, even though they are not like “Christendom” in claiming to be spiritual Israelites. You want life! Then do that which is right and equal. Do not withhold from the “stranger that is within thy gates” his right, namely, to hear God’s life-giving message. Freely thou hast received; rightly then, freely give. Show no partiality or respect of persons. Misjudge not thy Christian brother or “neighbor”. Let him bear his own burden before the Lord and answer to his own Master, the Lord, who judges him.—Rom. 14:4; Gal. 6: 5. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.—2 Tim. 2:9. </span><span class="font6">Continue to preach as Christians, even if obliged to do this individually and with merely the Bible. Because the legal corporation which has acted locally as a servant has been dissolved by worldly official decree, that does not release God’s covenant people from acting individually as ministers of the gospel, following the method of preaching that Jesus and his apostles used. The bearing of Jehovah’s name not in vain is by acting according to the commission from him rather than by merely labeling oneself and introducing oneself by the “new name” which Jehovah’s mouth has named. Religionists label themselves by the name “Christian”, but are not such in action. “A man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.”—Jas. 2:18.

<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus is the great Fisher. He sent forth his apostles as “fishers of men”. Since his coming to the temple, in 1918, the river of truth of life has flowed forth from God’s temple with healing to all who partake of the truth with faith and obedience. Jehovah God, by his prophet Ezekiel, foretold this in a vision. (Ezek. 47:1-10) Christ Jesus has sent forth under the guidance of his holy angels the faithful remnant approved in the temple judgment and who are anointed and commissioned as Jehovah’s witnesses. With united action they cast in the net under the direction of the great Fisherman, and he has gathered unto him thereby many “fish”, to wit, many persons of good-will, his “other sheep”. These have devoted themselves to God and now, in obedience to the Fisher’s invitation, they join in the fishing. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">That the greatest caution must now be taken, Micah 7: 5 emphasizes: “Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.” That refers to anyone in a close and tender relationship, like that of a wife. Suchlike make loud professions of love for the creature from whom they hope to wheedle out information; but they do not keep God’s commandments or do his witness work, thereby showing love for the creature rather than for God. (Rom. 16:17,18) Such ones are like Delilah, the Philistines’ tool whom Samson loved and whose lap she let him make his pillow. This intimacy she encouraged in order to learn the secret of his strength and cripple him for the war against religion. God’s Word warns to leave such ones, and “go from them”. Why? Read Jeremiah 9:2-6. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Defenders of religion would have God’s truth silenced and its proclaimers barred from all means of publication. What care such that “Christendom” is threatened with early destruction and the lives of the public are in danger ? Let such consider this: Since God does not regard the things dear to and cherished by the religionists, but will destroy the same at Armageddon, then His servants are committing nothing illegitimate or indecent in warning mankind that God will soon destroy such religious things, and showing the people why and wherefore. That is the greatest service to the public. It is of the greatest necessity and interest to them, and, with Armageddon so near, the time was never more convenient and fitting.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. . . that thou mayest go with us.—Judg. 11:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jephthah wanted to make sure they realized their mistake and would not repeat their past course of action just as soon as he had served their present desires of victory over Ammon. Such course would be gross thanklessness to God who provided the instrument for the fight to vindicate his name. Not merely amid distress is Jehovah to be sought, nor only during a fearful emergency is his Theocratic rule to be put into effect and complied with. It is the organization which, once set up and submitted to, is to be held fast and conformed to ever after, beyond Armageddon. It will succeed. Never need the democratic experiment be repeated by the driving out of Theocratic rule, and never will it be. IV </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The spirit upon the Greater Isaiah, Christ Jesus, is the spirit to victory over the forces of demonism and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The word which pours forth from His mouth is not religious propaganda ; it is God’s revealed message. To be filled with that spirit and that word is our only safeguard against being invaded and overpowered by the world’s spirit and propaganda, which is demonism. That spirit being upon the remnant as upon their Head Jesus, it is their commission to preach. That spirit being also upon the “other sheep”, they have the moving power and the authorization and command to preach the same message as do the anointed remnant, and they pass along the message and say, “Come!” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah never backs up an enemy curse upon those who faithfully serve him. The “man of sin” class, including “Christendom’s” clergy, hire out to the worldly powers who are out for world domination and therefore oppose The Theocracy and who pay the religionists to curse Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching that Theocratic Government. Jehovah long ago turned Balaam’s attempted curse into a blessing. (Numbers 22-24) Today the curses and misrepresentation of his covenant people by the religionists He makes to work for a witness to the Kingdom and for the good of his faithful witnesses who love him. (Deut. 23: 4, 5 ; Josh. 24: 9,10) No curses written in God’s Word can with effect be applied against his faithful servants. Religious curses pronounced upon them by the pope and like clergy are neither Biblical nor of God, but are demoniacal and are of no avail.

<p><span class="font6">Such ones are in the temple and are righteous by reason of having received the favorable judgment of approval by the Lord, and are made a part of his organization. It is for such that the light shines in the temple, and for such the light was sown. It is the light of Jehovah’s glory, shining in the face of Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great High Priest, and which light is reflected or mirrored to those in the temple. To those who have a pure heart the light shines upon their countenance, illuminating their minds and filling the heart with joy. The pure in heart are those who are wholly dcv<sup>nf</sup>ed to God and his kingdom, and who are free from selfish exaltation or a desire to receive the plaudits of men. Those who possess an upright and pure heart are the ones to whom God’s light at the temple now brings great gladness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The prophecy makes a picture of what the religionists will do when they come to realize that sudden destruction is just before them. The picture is not one expressing sympathy with religionists, but is for a sign to them, indicating prophetically to “Christendom” what awaits that unholy organization. It is not Jehovah’s will that his faithful people should howl and lament for anyone that becomes unfaithful to God and his kingdom, and who has for that reason lost all. Anyone who howls and laments because the wicked suffer destruction shows he is not faithful to the Lord God and does not love Him. The greatest favor that ever came to man is to know and serve Jehovah and to bear the name of Jehovah, and anyone who is unfaithful to that blessing and privilege is unworthy of sympathy.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.—2 Tim. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been one set purpose behind the persecution, namely, to bring the name of Jehovah into contempt and reproach; to make it unpleasant and painful to serve and obey him; to prevent the setting up of the Government of Righteousness; and to turn all persons away from it and its Creator. That Government means glory and vindication to the name of its Author and Builder. It means the blessing of all those subject to it with life in perfect health, peace and prosperity, without end. Those who endure the persecution unto the end and keep integrity have a part in the vindication of God's name. Everlasting blessings go along with that privilege, because Jehovah honors those who honor his name. Those who do not maintain their integrity lend support to the persecutor’s argument and shall share a like fate with him, that is, everlasting destruction.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song.—Ps. 98:1, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shall the enemy fully stifle the songs of victory in praise of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government? Regardless of the determined effort made to that end, the thing of immediate concern now is that the divine Composer commands his trained ones to sing on and to march ahead, faces to the foe, and singing as they march. The songs were prepared for this day of battle and war, and they must be sung by God’s devoted servants; else he would make the very stones to sing out, that the prophecy of his Word might be vindicated. Not with carnal weapons, nor depending upon charging horses, nor trusting in the sturdy, seasoned legs drilled by totalitarian masters, do Jehovah’s servants tramp forward in offensive action against the enemies of The Theocracy, but solely clad in heavenly “armour of God” and singing the songs He has put in their mouths.-—Eph. 6:11-18.

<p><span class="font6">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">should follow his steps: who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.—1 Pet. 2: 21, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the real atonement for human sin the victim offered is and must be the ransom, the redemptive price, the means of deliverance which corresponds perfectly with the thing that is to be released or recaptured. Hence in the real atonement service the sin-offering is synonymous with ransom. Only in Christ Jesus' did Jehovah God provide the ransom. Christ Jesus ‘gave himself a ransom for many’. (Matt. 20: 28) He has “washed us from our sins in his own blood” (Rev. 1:5); “there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6) Therefore Christ Jesus is alone in the sin-offering. When he presents the merit or value thereof in the presence of Jehovah God in heaven, he needs no assistance of others. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Besides the faithful men of old there are others in the graves who have “done evil” by reason of inherited sin. That these might share in the benefits of the sin-atonement Christ Jesus will utter his voice and call them forth in due time “unto the resurrection of judgment”. (John 5:29, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.V.)</span><span class="font6"> By faithful obedience to The Theocratic Government and maintaining integrity under the test of judgment, these shall “obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead”. (Luke 20:35,36) Hence, in the atonement-day type, what the bullock left to be accomplished the Lord’s goat must be used to accomplish, namely, make atonement for the camp of Israel and sojourning strangers, all of whom pictured those whose life blessings will be on earth in the new world.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.—Rev. 12:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The allegiance of the angels to the newly installed King, Jehovah’s God-like Son whose official title in heaven is “Michael”, was immediately put to the test in 1914. After the birth of The Theocratic Government from the womb of God’s universal organization, or “woman”, war in heaven was begun against the demon organization that had long been tolerated in heaven. The holy angels proved they were with and for God’s installed King, and they fought under this “Michael” against that frightful dragon organization. It was ousted from heaven. It has since been a time of woe for the earth and sea, but a time of rejoicing for those in the heavens. The victory of the New Government at its birth is a sure guarantee of its victory over Satan’s entire organization at Armageddon in vindication of Jehovah’s name.—12:12.

<p><span class="font6">In the present world crisis Jehovah’s witnesses have not sinned against the worldly political element, but have stuck to Jesus’ command: “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” The wrong which political forces do against them is at the insistence of the clergy, who hate Jehovah’s name and Theocracy. It becomes plain that the Greater Jephthah of today must let Jehovah be the Judge; let him set the judges of modern Ammon in their place. What the Supreme Judge thinks, decides and rules is of highest concern, not what the worldly courts and judges hand down against those who faithfully safeguard God’s Kingdom interests.

(Ps. 94: 20) The Lord has no fellowship with such iniquitous law-framers now in the throne on earth. Such laws could not even be constitutional, because they take away the right of an unpopular minority to freely worship God by following in the steps of Jehovah’s Chief Witness as he left us the example. (1 Pet. 2:21) When he called the religious clergy “wolves”, and other true terms, he was not guilty of “an unrestrained outpouring of intolerant and bigoted hatred” nor of “libel of a group”. Yet He was crucified at the instance of clergymen heading a mob and as an act that was “urgent for the protection of domestic peace and unity”.

Small contributions they receive from those who accept the printed message they apply in the Lord’s service to the printing of more books and delivery of such to other spiritually hungry ones. Christ Jesus does not fight the battle of Armageddon to seize the enemies’ booty for self-enrichment, but to unselfishly vindicate and hallow Jehovah’s name. That battle is not for self-gain or self-glory of creatures, but is consecrated to the glory of Jehovah, “the Lord of the whole earth.” The fight is for the vindication of His name and the settling of the issue of universal domination in His favor.

<p><span class="font6">The religious crowd would like to get in by use of “fifth column” dupes, but the angels watch the entrances to God’s spiritual temple and Holy City. The wicked may try the rod of regimentation, but God’s covenant people who have given him their word will not modify the routine of their lives and change from His work and way and conform to the totalitarian way. They continue to do the one thing stated in His commission to them, to preach this Kingdom gospel. Persecution does not affect the internal order of the organization, nor break up the unity of spirit and purpose and action, nor stop the submission and obedience to the “Higher Powers”. Only the Lord’s “rod” stays placed. His remnant and their companions put forth the hand to no iniquity, but only to his prescribed work.

<p><span class="font6">The watching means carefulness as to fulfilling one’s covenant with Jehovah and lest one violate the covenant and earn Jehovah’s disapproval. Since the watch-place at the stone-heap bearing witness to the covenant of Jacob and Laban was in Gilead, meaning “Heap of witness”, the watching must apply to carrying out one’s covenant with Jehovah to be his witness and to be at peace, harmony and unity with his Theocratic organization. This is shown by the further words of Laban concerning his two daughters, Jacob’s wives, who pictured God’s “woman” or organization: “If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives [picturing organizations other than that of Jehovah] beside my daughters, no man is with us”; that is, to make a checkup and call the offender to account.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has now delivered up the religious-totalitarian aggressors, to be withstood, outmaneuvered, outfought, and turned back by his Theocratic Society under Christ Jesus. This will be true until the “strange work” is done, the dividing of the people as “sheep” and “goats” is completed and all these sheep of the Lord are gathered into the fold on the right side of the King. Jehovah’s witnesses fight not with carnal weapons, against “flesh and blood”, but against the demons back of the religious-totalitarian crowd. Their fight is to uphold Jehovah’s worship by serving as his witnesses. Jephthah was not on the defensive, and neither are they. The persecution upon them shall be defeated in its purpose.

<p><span class="font6">The “new heavens” are Christ Jesus the King and his 144,000 glorified Kingdom associates, all together constituting The Theocracy. The King thereof was never on the side of sin and unrighteousness and never will be ; and him Jehovah God loves most dearly of all righteous creatures. The “new earth” is that “so great cloud of witnesses”, those faithful men of old, whom the King makes “princes in all the earth” and who will rule in justice, judgment and righteousness among men that live. Having purposed this new world the moment that the issue of universal domination was raised by Satan’s course, Jehovah God manifested his love for that world of righteousness to be so great that he gave his only begotten Son to be the King thereof. The Lord gave or appointed his beloved Son to be the Head One of The Theocracy, which is His instrument to vindicate His name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 118 ft 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The “companions” that went with Jephthah’s daughter to the lonely mountains would be virgins like herself. These volunteered to share reproach with her and to bewail with her. All these virgins together picture the Lord’s “other sheep”. This means to say that the “other sheep” do not remain alone in this state of complete devotion to the Lord. They declare God's requirements for life in the new world to others. They help others thereby to become “companions” of themselves and of Jehovah’s remnant and thus to share in suffering those reproaches that come on all who uphold the banner of The Theocracy. The requirement of virginity pictures that before Armageddon’s fight the “other sheep” must serve God at his temple in singleness of devotion.

<p><span class="font6">Religion has become the greatest money-making racket of all. The religious leaders seek further hire in the form of flatteries and the honor and praise of men. They seek not the honor which comes from God only, and hence do not believe God’s Word. (John 5:44) Their love of money or selfish gain is the root of the evil of religion. They do not love God or his righteousness, and hence do not obey his commandments. Seeking to win the applause and admiration of men, they try to appear wise and learned. Assuming to be teachers, they therefore refuse to “see thy teachers” and to recognize that, since the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918, Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the Teachers and that ‘all of Zion’s children shall be taught of Jehovah’, and not of men.

Jeremiah and his faithful companions lived in the final years of judgment upon religious Jerusalem and saw its destruction, and they survived it in vindication of Jehovah’s promise of preservation. Jeremiah spoke in the name of Jehovah God and was one of Jehovah’s line of witnesses from and after Abel.

The Lord’s power prevails in them; his strength is made perfect in their weakness. They know that but a short time now and his almighty hand of power shall prevail over the adversaries and haters of The Theocracy and shall slap them down and cut them off and the Lord’s hand shall remain uplifted in victory.

Since 1918 Jehovah’s “strange work” by his witnesses shows his approval upon his remnant and his acceptance and use of them. It likewise covers the enemy organization with shame. During the wartime when she was on top she taunted Jehovah’s servants and said: “Where is the Lord [Jehovah] thy God?” Now let her say it! The tables have been turned! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">By self-assumptions and help of religion the wicked exalt themselves to positions of power and authority in defiance of Jehovah and his anointed King, even to declaring it illegal to bear the “new name” from God and to preach Jehovah’s Theocracy. But under this crushing world-pressure Jehovah’s everlasting arms hold up his meek and obedient servants, and these trample under foot the opposition of the wicked and carry on as His ordained ministers of the gospel. Christ Jesus, who is the Meekest of God’s meek ones, already has cast Satan out of heaven and down to the ground and has him and his demon and human agents under his soles as his footstool. At Armageddon He will twist his heel upon them all as upon a viper. Jehovah’s servants will walk over the places where these wicked ones once were. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It was not sympathy for sinful man and the need therefore to taste their frailties that brought God’s Son to earth. The question that was linked to the issue of God's universal domination and which must be settled was: Adam as a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font6"> man had failed to resist the Devil and his temptation. Could Jehovah, then, put his Son as a perfect man on earth, subject him to the temptations and sufferings at Satan’s hands, and still have Jesus maintain his integrity flawless and not be forced out of God’s organization? Would he show perfectness of obedience under such temptation and suffering, even to death, and thereby vindicate his Father’s word and name? Would he be faithful and true as a witness for Jehovah and His Theocracy under the enemy reproaches and oppositions ? By his faithful course Jesus answered that principal question to the vindication of his Father. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The persecution is due to the great issue of universal domination. Remember that the question related to that primary issue is, Can Jehovah God retain in service in His organization any creatures who are exposed to the bitter persecution of the dragon organization? This related question applies not only to the anointed remnant of God’s “little flock”, but equally as much to their earthly companions in service, the Lord’s “other sheep”, whom He is now gathering into his fold. Both the remnant and these “other sheep” have the honored opportunity of deciding this question to God’s glory and Satan’s rebuff. The faithful will do so. They maintain their integrity in God’s service though it may cost them their lives. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This corresponds with Jesus’ warning: “When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, . . . then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains.” (Matt. 24:15,16) Those who would escape must flee from “Christendom” and take refuge under Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. For centuries men have sought rest in religion and in “Christendom”. But the rulers have not given the people rest by religion, up till now, nor can they do so by “more religion” in a proposed “new world order” after total war. To remain in “Christendom” would mean to perish at Armageddon; for “Christendom” is polluted and leads to destruction at Armageddon, where she also will be destroyed.

<p><span class="font6">The demon forces now put forth desperate efforts to break up the peace, unity and prosperity that exist within the land or earthly condition of God’s remnant and their companions. The totalitarian crowd are symbolized by “the Assyrian”. Their invasion is under the demon leadership of Gog, chief prince or understudy of Satan, as shown at Ezekiel 38: 8,16. The demon forces and totalitarian crowd even “tread in our palaces”, and abiding-places of Jehovah’s witnesses in peace and prosperity and which represent The Theocracy; as, for example, when the arbitrary religion-inspired forces invaded the Watch Tower branch offices and closed them down and declared their gospel preaching “illegal” and “subversive to the state”.

When the “kings” of the north and of the south pool their interests in a totalitarian world-combine, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will not fail to get astride that scarletcolored “beast”. She will ride it in a total charge against Jehovah’s servants to rob them of all and safeguard her treasures of wickedness. The peace arrangements under her dominance will make no allowance whatever for Jehovah’s witnesses after the conflict for world domination. (Rev. 17:1-6) The totalitarian dictators and politicians who cry for “more religion” plan on retaining the religious moneychangers in the temple after the conflict. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Zion’s “remnant of her seed” and their earthly companions are blessed above all other creatures on earth. (Matt. 5:10-12) There is no peace and unity in the world, in any nation. But among those who are separate from the world and in covenant relationship with God and serving him according to his Theocratic rule there is peace. They pray for this peace to continue among them. (Ps. 122: 6-9) In peace they do the Lord’s work together. Their fighting is only against the demons. (Eph. 6:12) They mark all who cause divisions and disturbances, and avoid them as not being of God’s Theocratic organization. (Rom. 16:17,18) Gathered about his table in the presence of their enemies, they feed upon the fullness of the “fat of wheat”, that is, the choicest life-sustaining truths of God’s Word concerning his Theocratic Government.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.—Matt. 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s servants are already in the city when persecution arises. They did not hesitate to go there because of threat of persecution. If assigned that territory and if sent thither by the Lord’s organization, they go there and face the carrying out of the threat. Paul was repeatedly warned that to go to Jerusalem meant to be mobbed, bound hand and foot and delivered over to the Godless; but, recognizing it to be the Lord’s will, he went, not just to run into trouble, but to prove his integrity and be a witness for Jehovah and his King. Paul’s faithfulness opened up the greatest privileges of witnessing before rulers, including the imperial ruler of the world power, Rome. Faithfulness opens up the way to many privileges of this kind, in fulfillment of Mark 13: 9. It is for a testimony against such official rulers.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s anointed remnant and their companions are afflicted, forsaken, and called by names which religionists invent to misrepresent them and increase the persecution upon them. Many honest persons, like Saul of Tarsus, have been misled by religion to take part in such mistreatment of Zion’s children. But Jehovah is gracious during this short period before Armageddon. If any misled ones face the light, get their eyes opened, and turn in repentance and conversion to Jehovah and his King and subject themselves to these “Higher Powers”, Jehovah permits them to find refuge under the capital organization Zion. Many of suchlike have already come. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The question is before all “Christendom”, namely, Which is the true worship ? Whom do you worship and serve? The vast majority are being herded into religion’s pens by the aggressions of the totalitarian powers against the worship of Jehovah. None can stand up alone and survive against that religioustotalitarian monstrosity. Only Jehovah’s organization can and will fight that “new order<sup>-</sup>” abomination to a standstill and set earth free of it. His organization is Theocratic, and it will maintain the worship of Jehovah God under the most terrific pressure and all-out assault of demons and earthly rulers. His organization, The Theocracy, will preserve unbroken His worship into the new world. Only those who practice Jehovah’s worship in spirit and in truth shall survive and live in that “world without end”. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">They are stirred up by the demons to assault the God-fearing remnant and companions and to wage a war of lies and persecution against them. Religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who ride on top, steer the scarlet-colored peace “beast” against them to devour those who renounce religion and worship Jehovah and keep his commandments. This stirs up Jehovah’s anger and fury against the enemy. He having cleansed his servants from religion and set up the pure worship among them, He will not tolerate the efforts of the totalitarian-religious crowd to re-impose demonism upon his covenant-people who keep their integrity by faithfully resisting all such attempts by the “abomination of desolation”. As a climax, Jehovah by his Lamb will destroy those who refused to be cleansed and held to religion. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

When these are received the information contained therein should go to those of The Theocracy, and not to persons who have not proved their devotion to the Lord by their service. The Lord has committed to the faithful servants the interests of his kingdom, and when these interests of the Kingdom fall into your hand for their advancement, use wisdom in the dissemination of these truths and instructions.

<p><span class="font6">One who has made a covenant to do God’s will and who then is envious, covetous and ambitious, shows he has yielded to the seductive influence of Satan. He does not appreciate the real issue that is now to be finally determined. It is the name of Jehovah that is involved; the holy name of Almighty God will be vindicated, and that within a short time. It is God’s will that his name shall now be proclaimed throughout the earth as a witness to the people. After this is done, he will demonstrate his supreme power to all creation. (Ex. 9:16) To be faithful to God, and to continue to have a part in the proclamation of his truth, the creature must put self entirely in the background and must delight to do whatsoever is God’s will, even though in doing the same he is placed in a position of less honor amongst men than that occupied by others.

<p><span class="font6">“Declare ye it not at Gath” means the message is not to be told for the benefit of the modern Goliath of Gath, the giants of the modern Philistines, but Jehovah’s witnesses are to declare the vengeance of Jehovah for the benefit of those that are held in restraint by the Philistines, to the end that these honest-hearted Catholics may learn the truth and flee from the doomed organization. While the message must tell of the wickedness of the modern Philistines, the real purpose is to benefit the honest people. Jehovah’s witnesses are not to weep at all because calamity shall befall the Philistines or any other part of Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s judgment is against all who are against God and his kingdom, and there shall be no weeping because that crowd is exposed and adverse judgment is proclaimed against them.

<p><span class="font6">When one quits the service as a witness in order to escape the actions of the opposers of The Theocracy, he is fleeing like Urijah down to Egypt, that is, Satan’s world; for there are only two organizations. If any are ashamed to confess the Lord’s Theocratic organization, and thuswise deny it, then they cannot have protection of the Great Theocrat and his King, but are seeking protection from the world, which withholds injury if anyone lines up with it. Those who, like Jeremiah, are apprehended while performing their Christian commission are not forsaken by the Lord, not if keeping integrity toward Him. There are those of that number whom He will preserve alive and will deliver when He destroys “Christendom” at Armageddon. They shall survive, but persecutors and prisonkeepers will be destroyed, down to the last man.

Such evergreen trees picture God’s anointed witnesses commissioned by the anointing of his spirit to preach the good news of the Kingdom. (Isa. 61:1-3) The place of Jehovah’s sanctuary or temple is in his organization Zion. There his feet stand as he wields universal domination through his King, Christ Jesus. The King is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and through him Jehovah makes the place of his feet glorious. The other “trees of righteousness” share with Christ Jesus in vindicating Jehovah’s name and in proving the Devil a base liar.

True democracy stands for and observes the principle of freedom to worship Jehovah according to his will and commandments, and freedom to publish his name and Righteous Government as Christ Jesus and his apostles did. For the past decade and more Jehovah’s witnesses have stood out prominently before the nations and proved themselves in the forefront of the fight for such righteous principles of democracy and against the modern Ammonites who would stop the exercise of such principles. The protest by the Greater Jephthah is occasioned by religion which has fostered totalitarianism in order to gain world domination and hold the monopoly of worship.

Those waiting on the Lord spare themselves many difficulties, burdens, heartaches, and griefs and enjoy the greatest measure of freedom for a part in His work. Those of the Lord’s “other sheep” who now have children or to whom children are born in the natural course of things do well to follow the apostle’s advice and “bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord”.

Jehovah will vindicate his name in the destruction of the wicked; hence he will not answer their selfish prayers for preservation. “Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.” (Prov. 21:13) They have been warned by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, but have scoffed at the warning and not taken advantage of the time available to flee to The Theocracy.

The enlightened persons of good-will turn from religion and to the great Teacher and seek more life-giving knowledge. They listen to what the Kingdom publishers have to say. Now, before it is too late, they turn out of demonized man’s ways, which lead down to destruction, and get onto the Lord’s ways, which are truth and light and righteousness and life.

The fulfillment is at a time when the enemies are still active and are opposing the newly enthroned King and assaulting all publishers of the King and Kingdom.

Those privileged to pass through Armageddon into the new condition on earth must now walk with Jehovah God, as Noah did before the Flood. (Gen. 6:8,9) Now the Devil’s organization brings forth the “image of the beast” to meet the world emergency and to make it appear that men can bind up this world into a peaceful and enduring arrangement, so making unnecessary and undesirable the kingdom of God.

The seventh and last fall of Jehovah’s “just” ones will be when the witness work of his remnant and their companions shall shortly be closed down in every land on earth and the enemy jubilantly begin to cry “Peace and safety!” Then, suddenly, the wicked enemy shall themselves fall into the “mischief” that the Lord prepares for them, His “strange act” at Armageddon.

Like a great river, continually enlarged as thousands more join the movement into the Kingdom, these “peoples” of good-will flow unto it and actively take their stand on His side. This the Devil, by his rulers of “Christendom”, has viciously tried to prevent and to turn the flow of such peoples back, into the broad road leading to the “Dead sea” of destruction at Armageddon. (Dan. 11:45) The demon forces cannot stop Jehovah’s “strange work” until done. Likewise they eannot halt the ingathering and flow of the peoples, the Lord’s “other sheep”, unto The Theocracy until all such are gathered into the “one fold” under Kingdom protection.

The coming of this class is an open and indisputable token of the victory of the Theocratic Society under Christ Jesus over the unrighteous, unconstitutional encroachments of the religious-totalitarians.

His name has long been reproached by the Devil, who charges that Jehovah cannot put a man on earth who will hold fast his blamelessncss and faultlessness toward God under assault and test by the Devil. By such the adversary seeks to cause the fall of Jehovah’s servants and thus give cause and occasion for all God’s enemies to reproach God and doubt his supreme power.

(Pss. 59:5; 143:12) Jehovah is merciful to those who arc determined not to turn again to foolishness of this world but to be faithful to the end. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They without us should not be made perfect. —Heb. 11:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful men of old who lived and died before the entrance of the High Priest Christ Jesus with the value of his human sacrifice into God’s presence in heaven extended from Abel to John the Baptist. These could not then get any redemptive benefit from a sacrifice that had not yet in their time been offered to God. They were first in time, but in comparing them with the members of Christ’s “body” as to the benefits of the real sin-atonement, ‘the first shall be last, and the last first.’ They could not be “made perfect” before the members of Christ’s body have been made up and brought into unity with their High Priest at the temple. Hence it was also that his “other sheep” of the present time first began to be gathered after the great High Priest came to the temple in 1918 and assembled the remnant into unity there.

<p><span class="font6">After the remnant are judged at the temple, the King and Judge proceeds to the judgment of all the nations. That judgment is now on. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the dividing of the people of the nations into classes, the sheeplike ones in favor of Jehovah’s Theocracy and the goatlike ones in opposition to it, these things are certain visible proofs that the judgment of the nations is on. The “sheep” are gathered to the right side of “Mount Zion” on which reigns the King. Being assembled on that side of favor and approval, the faithful “sheep” are companions of the remnant and shall enjoy the King’s blessings and protection and preservation unto life everlasting on earth. The “goats” at the left and in opposition to “Mount Zion” meet destruction in the fire of Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“Walk humbly with thy God” and not contrary to him. That means to be not self-willed, but obedient to God’s law and organization instructions. Recognize the true “Higher Powers”. Do not support schemes that exalt creatures and organizations which oppose Jehovah and his universal domination by his Theocracy. Do not think thyself above God’s law and that man’s law is higher than God’s in some cases, especially in some man-made emergency. The world emergency with Armageddon at the door is the very time to most anxiously keep God’s law and obey him rather than obey desperate men. Only those who thus walk obediently with Jehovah God as Noah walked with God down to the Flood will have any chance to survive Armageddon and serve him beyond.—Gen. 6: 9.

<p><span class="font6">Jephthah must turn his daughter over to Jehovah God at his tabernacle in Shiloh, where God’s priests and Levites under their high priest ministered to the Great Theocrat. There she would be assigned duties of service suitable for her to do and of aid to the priests and Levites. The position of servant of the Most High is made honorable by Christ Jesus, God’s Elect Servant. At the tabernacle Jephthah’s daughter maintained her virgin state, as her father’s vow debarred her serving a husband and family. She served God without abstraction of family cares. In the Theocratic organization today the vow to Jehovah must be carried out. Christ Jesus, the Head of that organization, must perform and fulfill the things promised to God concerning the “other sheep”. That is Jehovah’s will or “statute”; the Greater Jephthah will not fail to carry it out in spiritual Israel. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">What remains yet of God’s “strange work” of witnessing, which immediately precedes that “strange act”, is nearing a completion. When finished, this grandest privilege on earth will for ever have passed. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses can ill afford to divide their time and attention between His active service part of the time and for the rest of the time indulging in the pleasure-mad doings of the nations that forget God. To do so would be a slackening of the hand in his service and would be a violation of their covenant to do his will all the time and the Devil’s none of the time. Faithfulness to duty in the Lord’s “strange work” is our safeguard. Now, when so near the goal, we cannot safely or with wisdom let down the barriers to the invasion and control of the demons. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Beware of false prophets.—Matt. 7:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nations have forgotten God. They put their trust in men, and resent God’s true message of judgment and warning and choose to listen to demonized men who predict good times to come by human achievements with no need of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. (Mic. 2:11; 2 Tim. 4:3,4) To such prophets they do not say: “Prophesy not.” Hence they choose religion and shall not drink joy, but only sorrow and death, at Armageddon. Satan’s efforts by these false prophets are to deceive the remnant of God’s elect and their devoted companions. The faithful ones will not permit themselves to be deceived by religion or demonism, but will maintain their integrity and continue to proclaim the true prophecy of God’s Word and to stand immovable for his Theocracy, that thus they may be “blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus”. —1 Cor. 1: 8.

<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures strongly indicate that toward the beginning of Armageddon Christ Jesus, the King-Father, will resurrect from their long sleep of centuries the faithful men of old and will give them life as his children, as perfect men, and these he will make “princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16; Hob. 11:35) He will doubtless bring forth and present to the remnant and companions these “princes” among men at a time of dire crisis for his covenant people. Such future “princes” died standing up against the demon rule in the times before Christ. They will be delighted to again face the demon forces at Armageddon and see such wiped out. Whether the “eight principal men” means or includes those resurrected faithful men of old remains to be seen. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Each one who really loves God and The Theocracy will carefully and constantly safeguard the interests of God’s work and of his brethren who are “labourers together with God”. A slip by one betraying vital information to the enemy not merely affects the careless, loose-speech cd one, but also endangers the organization. Let not your tongue bring you within or under the power of any agent of Satan and his demons. For aid, comfort and heart-to-heart fellowship do not rely on any human relationships and companionships, but lean wholly upon Jehovah and Christ, showing devotion to them wholly independent of any earthly creature. Look to Jehovah through our “advocate with the Father”, who is Christ Jesus. Have intimacy and fellowship with his faithful organization, Zion, and not with earthly creatures not in covenant with Him and not meeting his requirements.

<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus fulfilled this picture by shedding his blood and thereafter being resurrected from the dead as a divine spirit and ascending to heaven itself, into Jehovah’s presence amidst the cherubim. The blood symbolized the right to earthly life. (17:11, 14) The right to life as a perfect man Jesus had not forfeited through sin. With the merit of his human sacrifice the risen High Priest Christ Jesus appeared in God’s presence in heaven’s Holiest of all. Nineteen centuries ago he completed the full transaction in heaven at his ascension and appearance “in the presence of God for us”. There he made the purchase of that which was lost for Adam’s offspring, and so he gave up the possession of what he presented and he took over that which he redeemed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Where faithful witnesses have gone to their territory and begun the work in a city or locality, and where, besides the persecution, the opposition becomes so organized and all-embracing that it is impossible to further witness there publicly and from house to house, then it is time to consider Jesus’ instruction. God has now called the attention of his commissioned servants to the fact that now is the time to hunt for his “other sheep” wherever they have been scattered, and to comfort them as commanded. (Isa. 61:2) If therefore the “goats” conspire and rise up en masse in a city and locality and make it impossible to keep on giving the witness there in an open and general way, then to spend further time upon them would be to no avail. Seek “sheep” outside such goat-pen. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In a war against a regimented, authoritarian heathen nation engaged in a “total war” which made every individual in the state a part of the war machine, the Israelites could not afford to have any looseness of organization according to which “every man did that which was right in his own eyes”. (21:25) They needed then a Theocratic “head”, the same as in the case of earlier deliverances of Israel by Almighty God. To such head these Gileadites promised to yield obedience. They would hold fast to him as the Lord’s choice and be subject to organization instructions through him and carry them out. They did not want a number of heads with divided opinions and conflicting campaign plans of action; no, but unified, central command! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Worldly nations are all on the one side, regardless of political disagreements. The vast majority think the decision must be made by each individual as between totalitarian rule and democracy. The “god of this world” and all his demon hosts would keep the people in ignorance as to the real issue: that it is between this world of which he is god and Jehovah’s new world under The Theocracy of his Son Jesus Christ. The main question also takes in this related one, namely, Who are the Higher Powers, the religious-political rulers of this world or Jehovah and Christ Jesus? The battle of Armageddon, which is near, will answer these throbbing questions, right. Time for individual decision is therefore limited. Each must take the consequences of his choice, either destruction with Satan’s world or everlasting life on the victorious side of The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font6">Here “the harp” symbolizes God’s Word as written in the Bible. The singing or declaration of the message by the voices of Jehovah’s servants must be in tune and harmony with this foundation-toned Word, The Holy Scriptures. In parts of the earth where the enemies of The Theocracy have officially and judicially declared Jehovah’s good work outlawed and taken away the literature explaining the Scriptures, and in other parts where the upset world conditions have made it impossible to get supplies of literature, there Jehovah’s covenant-keeping servants continue as true Christians to preach as the apostle Paul did, “from house to house,” and using just the Bible itself, either carried with them or already in the homes of the people they visit. They must keep singing praise to Jehovah God. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It was a contract made before Jehovah and in his name, and as hearer He would watch as to its fulfillment. If the Gileadites sincerely meant their part of the covenant and showed faith by fighting courageously alongside Jephthah and under his command, then Jehovah would do his part and give victory over the aggressor Ammon. Also now, by joining themselves to the Theocratic organization at God’s invitation and by submitting themselves to it and offering expressions of loyalty and devotion to it, Jehovah’s witnesses are binding themselves. Like the elders of Gilead they know God is listening to their expressions and promises and will hold them accountable if they rebel against and throw off the Theocratic rule and organization at any time henceforth.

The wicked purpose back of persecution will be defeated, proving Satan a liar. The persecutions yet to come may crowd Jehovah’s witnesses sorely; they may cause them perplexity as to what way to take; they may cause them to be pursued by political, military, judicial, newspaper, and commercial allies of religion; they may cause them to be cast down in the public eye and deprived of legal and constitutional equality with citizens of the world. Yet such persecutions will never wipe out Jehovah’s witnesses, nor distress them into desperation and cause them to take the compromising course where God will abandon and deny them as unfaithful.

In a conflict between &quot;Caesar’s” laws and Jehovah’s law out of Zion there is only one choice for such. God’s law is the higher and comes first; they must obey it without compromise. They dutifully obey all the laws of “Caesar” that are in harmony with righteousness and not in opposition to the law of Almighty God. His law takes hold on all the affairs of their life each day. (Ps. 119:10,11) Therefore they cannot follow blindly in any course dictated by men in authority without reference to God’s law.

Righteous indignation against wrongdoing is proper and right, because the man who follows the Lord Jesus Christ cannot look with approval upon wrongdoing. Sin is the transgression of God’s law. (1 John 3:4) When one becomes angry he may desire to give expression to that anger by administering bodily punishment to the one against whom he is angry, it not being a case of selfdefense. Such punishment would be a violation of God’s law, and therefore sin. God’s law says: “To me belongeth vengeance, ... I will render vengeance to mine enemies.” (Dent. 32:35,41,43) As the Lord is long-suffering toward his enemies, biding his own due time to punish them, so his servants must be long-suffering and forgiving and leave it to God in his own due time to execute his judgment against the wrongdoers.—Col. 3:13.

For this reason a number of the prophets wrote or prophesied about the same thing, and the facts come to pass in fulfillment of such prophecies in order that the man of God may have proof upon proof as corroborative evidence of the fulfillment of the prophecy, and this in order that the man of God may be kept strong in faith and in hope.

<p><span class="font6">When the prophet Urijah delivered the warning, the king and his officers sought to put him to death. Urijah was afraid and fled into Egypt. In his terror he fled out of his assigned territory altogether and quit the witness work by taking refuge in the land where Jehovah had ordered his covenant people never to return, namely, Egypt, symbol of Satan’s world. Therefore Jehovah did not protect Urijah as he did his prophet Jeremiah, but permitted Urijah to be caught by his enemies in the enemy organization, and executed. (Jer. 26:20-23) True, the prophet Elijah fled from before the wicked Queen Jezebel, but he fled to the mountain of God, Horeb, for meditation and communion with him. When the Lord set before him further work to do in the land of his religious persecutors, Elijah went back and did it faithfully until being taken away. —1 Ki. 19:1-21.

<p><span class="font6">Religion has failed, as proved by the facts today, after six thousand years of religion’s practice. Christianity has not failed, and never will. Though now the only true Christians are hated and persecuted of all nations, Christianity is not on the defensive. It is on the offensive against all religion, which is demonism and which has proved the ruin of humankind. The assaults by the totalitarian crowd upon the Christian witnesses of Jehovah are but the enemy counterattacks, all of which fail to break the integrity of God’s covenant-keeping people. It is God’s will that peace exist within their organization. It is his decree that unity in serving Jehovah God shall be observed and safeguarded among such. No one has a right to interfere with their united service. They carry the war into enemy territory. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.—Heb. 12:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the earthly part of Satan’s world organization Jehovah’s voice is heard in his message of the Kingdom and the day of his vengeance. This so terrifies the elements of the “earth” that they shake with wrath and rise up in persecution in all nations against Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers. They are further shaken by the fearlessness in the face of all adversaries as displayed by Jehovah’s witnesses who obey His word of command. Soon they will be shaken into the final all-out action against Him and His Kingdom, only to run into Armageddon’s shaking. In that universal war Satan’s “heavens” and “earth” and “sea” shall be shaken so terribly and mightily that they will vanish into invisible vibrations and dissolve into disorganization. —Ps. 46: 6-9.

<p><span class="font6">The earnest vows of Jehovah’s faithful servants in his Theocratic organization is that they might gain the victory over the mark of the beastly organization and its world-federation “image”, and be faithful to and carry on the pure and undefiled worship of God Jehovah. Thus they would have part in the vindication of His name together with Christ Jesus. The religioustotalitarian Ammonites might dissolve the chartered legal organizations recognized by the state, but they cannot dissolve the real Society of Jehovah’s witnesses which depends upon union with their Theocratic Head Christ Jesus and is beyond the decrees of political states. The divinely commanded activities of that Theocratic Society must go on till finished, and it is for this they make their unselfish vow unto Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And thereafter will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them.—Jer. 16:16, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hunting requires courage, endurance, alertness, promptness to spring into action, constant keeping on the track and stalking the game; a diligent search of the isolated and scattered parts, leaving no place untouched or uninvestigated, and particularly the places where game are wont to come for food, drink or rest in security, and even to leave some choice desired food for the scent of the game and to invite and attract them to manifest themselves. Where “many hunters” work together, they surround a certain area and then move in toward the common center, beating the bushes as they draw together in order to stir up their quarry. Thus they work together in unity, and jointly seek to let nothing escape, and they assist and help one another. They carry their equipment with them and act with speed in the use of it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Anointed One, having been once for all offered for the many, to bear atvay sin, will appear a second time without a sin-offering, to those who are expecting him, in order to salvation.—Heb. 9:28, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus, the High Priest, having been resurrected from the dead an immortal, divine spirit creature in the “express image of the Father’s person”, he comes no more in the flesh; the sacrifice for human sins is for ever accomplished. “Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin [as a sin-offering] once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.” (Rom. 6: 9,10) Christ Jesus came through his sin-atoning work on earth as High Priest clean, pure, holy, and with integrity maintained toward God. Now in resurrection glory he is for ever like Israel’s high priest with sacrificial garments put aside and clothed with the garments of glory and beauty.—Ex. 28: 2, 40; Lev. 16: 23, 24.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.-M.ic. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This will be during the thousand-year reign of the King greater than Solomon, when the people “dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree”. (1 Ki. 4:25) They shall fear only the “Higher Powers”, and shall be afraid of none others. (Isa. 11:9) Doubtless each family or group will be assigned a definite plot of ground, which shall be held in trust as a grant from the great King-Father, because Christ Jesus is the “heir of all things” of Jehovah. Under The Theocracy each will finally be responsible to the King-Father for his assigned portion and for the vine and fig tree and other things growing thereon, to dress and keep such. Each must do his part with all his neighbors and the “princes” in glorifying the earth as instructed and aided by The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sing unto the Lord ... He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.—Ps. 147:7, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many who are free and unencumbered, like those wild beasts and birds, and who could devote their entire time to direct service of The Theocracy in the field, fail or refuse to take advantage of that blessed opportunity. Their excuse is the fear they will not be taken care of by the Lord while so engaged as pioneers in daily and continuously praising him in obedience to His wise command. As answer to such an excuse the psalmist, and also the man without where to lay his head, Christ Jesus, pointed to the beasts and birds. If God sees to it that the helpless little ravens in the nest, which birds God’s own law classifies as unclean, are fed, will he not also faithfully provide lodging, food and raiment for one in a covenant with Him and who with lips clean of fear of man obeys God’s command and glorifies Him?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ.—Rom. 8:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If God, who is all-wise and wholly devoted to righteousness, so loved the new world as to give for it the most faithful and dependable of his sons to be the Ruler, then all persons having wisdom and loving righteousness should likewise love that new world and its Theocracy. They should choose such and henceforth stand immovably for such. Though the choice of The Theocracy means to endure affliction and tribulation for a short while at the hands of the world, do not let this dismay you. Do not let it deter you from making the right and wise choice that fixes for you the destiny of everlasting life and peace under the Righteous Government. Remember the choice of that man of integrity, Job, and his tribulation therefor. His end was more blessed than his beginning, and he will be one of the “princes” in the “new earth”.—Jas. 5:10,11. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">WL</span><span class="font6"> 123 U 1, 127 U 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He is our peace, who hath made both one.—Eph. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus Christ, the King of The Theocracy, is Jehovah’s liaison (unifying) officer between all his followers. If all these act in harmony with his instructions as set out in his Father’s Word, and which instructions he has taught them from the temple, then, even if scattered bodily by enemy action, yet they will all be doing the same thing. They will be acting, not as a legal organization dissolved by political law, but as God’s organization, which organization no human or demon power can dissolve or stop functioning. The bond of unity of this organization leaps all space and distance and man-made barriers; it constrains or holds together the scattered ones in a unity of purpose and action. Identical devotion to The Theocracy is the tie, the spirit of God in his servants is the moving power, and the message is God’s.—Col. 3:14,15; 2 Cor. 5:13-15.

<p><span class="font6">The blood of the new covenant calls for mercy on the ones who repent and turn from coming short of their obligations toward God. Therefore Jesus’ blood speaks better things than Abel’s did. The purpose of the new covenant was and is to Take out from all nations a people for Jehovah’s name’, with a view to vindicating His name. (Acts 15:14) That name must be declared throughout the earth by his witnesses before he shows his power over Satan in the battle of Armageddon. That battle is, by all signs and prophecies, very near at hand. It will burst upon the nations suddenly, like an unexpected thief in the night. Hence Jehovah’s name and the purpose for which it stands must be declared by his remnant now, before the outbreak of “the battle of that great day”.

<p><span class="font6">This is a cloud of witnesses, witnessing to the power and glory and presence of the Lord as a literal cloud in the sky does. In the land of the prophet Isaiah the doves fly in such thick flocks that they are like a cloud that fairly darkens the earth beneath. This figure, therefore, denotes yet a great ingathering of active witnesses for the Kingdom, who shall in the short time remaining before Armageddon fly with the speed of doves to the entrance that Jehovah has provided to the refuge of safety. Doves were offered as sacrifices by the poorest of the land, and the figure “doves” may mean that such flight of further Kingdom publishers shall come from the people who have been greatly impoverished by the total war for world domination, especially those who are “poor in spirit”.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame.—Heb. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus was uncompromising toward this world. He followed no appeasement policy with it or its god, Satan or Azazel. The Devil got no satisfaction or cooperation from Jesus. Hence, instead of turning away persecution, reproach and punishment, Azazel made that holy One his chief target and resorted to punishing him for his faithfulness and unbreakable integrity toward Jehovah God. By punishment undeserved at the hands of religionists the Devil tried to force Jesus to sin and fail of continuing worthy to be Sin-Bearer for believers. The Devil was out to prove his boast of being able to corrupt and turn aside every one of Jehovah’s servants under the test and so force them to quit Jehovah because he did not shield them from persecution but permitted the test.

<p><span class="font6">The downpour of frozen destruction is yet due at Armageddon. Immediately after Jehovah sends his emphatic warning out of the north and troubles the totalitarian-world combine (Dan. 11:44), then “Christendom’s” religionists will say, as long foretold: “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.” (Jer. 8:20) Then “his cold” will begin to set in, and they will seek refuge. There the biggest lie behind which they will hide for protection is the “abomination of desolation”, which world organization they declare is the kingdom of God. Taking refuge in this organized lie will not avail at the time of the big fight.

In the endless time to come there shall not be different governments on earth at the same time. There will be only one Government, indivisible, world-wide, only one central authority, and it will be heavenly, divine. It will be a paternal government, because all that live will be the children of the King, their Father who gives everlasting life. All living humankind shall be one united, inseparable family relationship, doing justly, walking humbly with their God and worshiping him in spirit and truth. The “new earth”, the King-Father’s “princes in all the earth”, shall remain forever.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 11:40, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These yearly meetings were not to glorify her, but were service meetings, going over the reason for her being there in tabernacle service, namely, the vindication of God’s name by his Theocratic organization over which Jephthah was then the visible God-appointed “head”. Thus they strengthened her to faithfulness. And doubtless whenever Jephthah visited the tabernacle in the regular feasts and also on special occasions when he consulted with the high priest on Theocratic matters or offered animal sacrifices, he had opportunity to see and associate with her. They rejoiced together in her special privilege of absolute devotion to God and his direct service. Jephthah also strengthened her to continue therein with faithfulness, integrity and blamelessness.

<p><span class="font6">Eventually all ruling factors of the earth will “give their power and strength” to the “scarlet coloured beast”. By this they expect to keep themselves in power as religious and political rulers, the religious on top. Therefore they oppose the proclamation of God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. They “eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence” against Jehovah’s servants who announce that kingdom as the rightful government of humankind that lives. Concerning the religious-political would-be rulers of the world, “these shall make war with the Lamb [of God], and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.” The religionists give their kingdom to the “beast”, but shall drink no joy of any lasting kingdom of their own nor any wine of joy of God’s kingdom.—17 :17.

<p><span class="font6">At Armageddon Jehovah God will make manifest his mighty “right hand”, to wit, Christ Jesus, his Executive Officer. Religionists refuse to believe the record of the exercise of God’s hand and might as set forth in the Bible; but at Armageddon He will repeat those acts on a vaster scale and thereby make the scoffers know His hand and power. He will fight the battle of that great day of God Almighty just once. It will not be repeated, because he will fight it to a completion in the total destruction of all opposers and all who challenge him as the true and living God. Before they descend into destruction he will make “Christendom” and all forgetters of God to know that his name is the holy name that they have despised and reproached, Jehovah!

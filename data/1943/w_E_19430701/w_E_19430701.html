<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in AD. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth’’ of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE ONLY LIGHT” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Through the darkness now covering the earth the divine command comes to all those enlightened with the truth to “arise and shine” and reflect the rays of “The Only Light” upon the ignorant and blinded. The month of August has been designated as “The Only Light” Testimony Period. Jehovah’s witnesses and all persons of good-will will then specially exert themselves in compliance with the heavenly command. During this midsummer month the ‘arising and shining’ will be done mainly by renewed efforts with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> on a contribution of 25c. Many can arrange their vacations to spend all their time or more of it than usual m this grand work of enlightenment. Will you join in letting your light slime! Your participation will be welcomed, and we shall be glad to furnish references to any wanting to associate with the nearest company of Jehovah’s witnesses in action. When the month’s testimony is over, send in your report of work accomplished and the results.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SUPREME COURT INTERPRETS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, 0 Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth’’—Ps. 133:2, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is the Supreme Judge or Justice. “For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.” (Isa. 33: 22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Not by virtue of any constitution drawn up by creatures to organize a national or world government is Jehovah the Most High Judge, nor is He limited or held in check by -what is written down in any state-making document on earth. He is the First and Most High Judge in his own right, by his own power and wisdom, and according to his own ever-existent being and his creatorhood. He is the source of the supreme law, which law is perfect and hence righteous. “The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul.” (Ps. 19:7, A.R.F.) He is the Creator of the written Constitution which governs his visible organization on earth. “From his right hand went a fiery law for them. Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet: every one shall receive of thy words.”—Deut. 33: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah needs no associate judge or justices with whom to consult or to qualify or overrule his own rulings, judgments and decisions. “Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord [Jehovah], or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?” (Isa. 40:13,14) The answer to this challenging question is, No one. He is therefore the Supreme Court in Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ In human or worldly processes of law the nation’s supreme court is the tribunal of last appeal in most cases; it is the court of last resort. Decisions of such court may appear to have infallibility and to be beyond recall, yet such human supreme court is not infallible. It makes mistakes, and at times reverses itself. Heaven's Supreme Court is infallible; its decisions are unchangeable. Rightly, it is the court of first appeal. To go aright and to be guided in the</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2 . Why does Jehovah need no associate in judgeship, and what la he in himself?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp; Why should Heaven’s Supreme Court be man's court of first appeal? </span><span class="font5">way of divine approval and of life in peace and prosperity all creatures should appeal first to Its decisions and abide by them. “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”—Eccl. 12:13, 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah God created and took into association with himself another judge, but not of equal power and authority with himself. That Associate Judge is a just and perfect one, God’s beloved and only begotten Son. Such action was only after God s supreme law had been put in issue throughout the universe. The appointment of such Associate Judge was only after the Son of God had proved himself inflexibly loyal and obedient to the law and judgments of the universal Supreme Judge. The Great Judge sent his Son to earth as a man nineteen centuries ago. He sent him to this earth where the supreme law is ignored, held in contempt and continually violated by imperfect, sinful humankind. With few exceptions, the whole race lies under the power of the wicked first violator of divine law, namely, Satan the Devil. In the midst of this world of lawbreakers the One whom Jehovah would appoint to be his Associate Justice and to execute his judgments toward law violators must be tested as to perfect keeping of God's commandments. He must put God’s law’ first and must obey it rather than laws and practices which are popular among sinful men. To prove his unbreakable devotion to God’s righteous standard and judgments the Son must never turn aside from doing his Father’s will, even under the hate, reproach, and violent oppositions of those who despise God’s law and word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> By thus keeping integrity under test the Son would prove himself trustworthy and reliable, both to God and to all other creatures. To him God would confidently entrust the heavenly judgeship with Him-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Whom did Jehovah take Into association with himself as judge, and after meeting what requirements and qualifications?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5. By keeping integrity under test, what did the Son of God pro\e respecting himself as to judgeship, and bow did God reward him? </span><span class="font5">self, with its obligation to execute to the letter the divine judgments and sentences toward men and angels. All lovers and doers of righteousness on earth who are denied justice by this evil world could and can look to Jehovah's tried and tested Judge for a fair trial and a righteous decision. Jehovah’s Judge Designate, Christ Jesus, did prove himself faultlessly faithful and submissive to the law and rulings of the Supreme Court, the Most* High Judge and Lawgiver. Therefore Almighty God has seated him in the judgeship. “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. . . . And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.” (John 5: 22, 23, 27) “He hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.”—Acts 17: 31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Jehovah is Supreme Judge, and Jesus is Superior Judge. Together they make up or compose “The Higher Powers”, to whom all living souls must be subject in righteousness. (Rom. 13:1) The Superior Judge said: “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” (John 5:30) In his days in the flesh the religious Pharisees followed the traditions of men and thereby transgressed and made void God’s commandments, and Jesus said to them: “Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.”—John 8:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup> This Associate Judge of proved integrity spoke often of the righteous new world, during which he will judge redeemed humankind. He said: “I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.”—John 12:46-50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The word of Christ Jesus the Judge is therefore the word of God. It expresses the commandment of God for those who seek life abundant. His commandment is unto life everlasting, and obedience to his commandments results in the gift of endless life to the obedient one. It is in the time of judgment that God’s word and commandment are specially made known, clear and understandable, because it is according to such word and commandment that the creatures on trial are judged. This denotes a wide publication of God’s word and law in the “last day”, the day of judgment. So it is written, at Isaiah 2:2-4: “It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ The “last days” began in A.D. 1914. That year the Gentile Times, or 2,520 years of uninterrupted Gentile rule over earth, ended, and “war in heaven” to oust Satan and his demons began. Also World War I on earth began, it being one of the visible proofs or signs which Christ Jesus foretold as due to mark the beginning of “the time of the end” for all Gentile nations of the world. That great Prophet then foretold that after the close of World War I “this gospel of the kingdom” would be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all nations. Such Kingdom-gospel preaching would serve as a means of judging those nations. After the delivery of such witness to the nations concerning God’s kingdom the final end would come upon the nations in a time of indescribable tribulation, the like of which has never yet occurred. This proves that the judgment would go against the nations.—Matt. 24:14-22; 25:31,32.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> As to who gives and who publishes the judgment word at the end of the world Psalm 68:11,12 says: “The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it. Kings of armies did flee apace.” Those kings lead armies in opposition to God’s established kingdom. They reject the word, hence are judged adversely by it. From and after the end of World War I in 1918 there has been such a world-wide publishing of the word which God has given. It has struck terror to the kings or rulers of the earth, and they have constantly tried to suppress that word, with some seeming success. They are finding that the word of Jehovah, the Supreme Judge, is indestructible. It is “the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”. (1 Pet. 1:23,25) The invisible and visible parts of the Devil’s organization will perish rather than that God’s written Word should fail and be destroyed. “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away,” said Jesus.—Matt. 24:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TO WHOM DOES THE BIBLE BELONG?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Today the written Word of God is complete. It has been complete since the death of the last or oldest of Christ’s apostles, namely, John, at the end of the first century A.D. The sixty-six inspired books of God's Word, The Holy Bible, were brought together as one Book during the second century. This was done under the supervision of the Bible's great Author and by men ivho were wholly devoted to him through a full consecration of themselves to Him. It is altogether out of line with the truth, not to say presumptuous and blasphemous, for any religious organization to claim to have made the Bible and to have exclusive right to it. On a Sunday this past February a religious priest of Toledo, Ohio, is reported by a local newspaper to have said the following in the sermon to his congregation:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“The Bible belongs exclusively to the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church made the Bible; she has preserved it; and she interprets it. Others may read the Holy Scriptures—and they are urged to do so—but beyond this they have no right whatsoever in regard to it. Almighty God has placed this precious heritage exclusively in the hands of his Catholic Church. . . . The Catholic Church was able to do this only because of the aid of the Holy Ghost, of the Holy Ghost actively fulfilling the promise of infallibility that our Lord had made to his church. No other institution possessed this gift: no other could have done the task. If the Catholic Church had not thus compiled the Bible, we today would not have the Bible. Therefore, it is perfectly true to say that the Catholic Church made the Bible. The Catholic Church not only made the Bible; she also preserved it.” —Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blade,</span><span class="font5"> March 1, 1943.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The above religious boast is on a level with certain Jewish religionists who likewise claim to be the “creators” of the Bible. All such boasts and claims are egotistical and a reproach to God’s name. Jehovah is the Creator, Compiler and Giver of the Bible. No man or group of men can truthfully and rightfully claim such relationship to that holy Book. If religious men or organizations were the creators, makers and compilers of the Bible, it would not be an inspired and infallible book; it would be full of religious errors and traditions of men and demonism. Under the devilish efforts made during the centuries till now to destroy the Bible it would have perished long ago. “For if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.” (Acts 5:38,39) Would-be destroyers of the Bible have failed to bring it to nought, because God is its preserver and creator. He is its inspirer. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Tim. 3:16,17) “For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the holv spirit.” (2 Pet. 1:21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> (See also Luke'1:68-70;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">2 Samuel 23:1,2.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Being inspired, the writers of the various books of the Bible did not know the full meaning or prophetic value of what they wrote, nor the complete interpretation of the prophecies they were inspired by the great Bible-Maker to write and utter. Hence the apostle Peter said: “The prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy [spirit] sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.”—1 Pet. 1:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> “Christendom’s” greatest religious organization, which claims to be exclusively the church of Christ, teaches that “the church of Christ is independent of the Bible, that it existed before the Bible, and would continue to exist unchanged without the Bible”. This poses the question, Which is more important, the Word of God written in the Bible, or an organization of creatures on earth! and can the true church set aside and ignore the Bible and proceed under divine inspiration and guidance without the written Word of God! The answer, and the facts supporting such answer, cannot be drawn from the traditions of the organization having its headquarters at Vatican City in Fascist Italy. The answer must be drawn</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">13 Why would the writers of the Bible books not know the full meaning or prophetic value of what they wrote? and what did Peter aay regarding the prophets aa to this matter?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14 . (a) What does “Christendom’!” greatest religious organization say concerning the Christian church in relation to the Bible? and *bat question does this raise? (b) From what source must the answer to such question be drawn, and why la no addition of the traditions of men needed? </span><span class="font5">from an inspired source, namely, the Holy Bible. Certain members of the true church were inspired to write twenty-seven books of that sacred Word, and Jesus, the Head of the true church, said in prayer to Jehovah God: “I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:14,17) In that prayer (verse 12) Jesus quoted from the book of Psalms, which book also declares: “Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.” “The words of the Lokd are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.” (Pss. 119:160; 12: 6) God’s written Word needs no addition of oral traditions, because such oral traditions of men prove to be lies that make the written Word of God of none effect. “Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.” (Prov. 30: 5, 6) God’s Word gives the answer of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Before the church of Christ came into existence, the Bible existed, that is, the Hebrew part thereof. With the prophet Moses the line of writing prophets began, so far as the Bible’s own account shows. Moses was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, for the Lord God sent Moses to specifically testify in His name and to declare Jehovah’s purpose. (Ex. 3:15-18, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font5"> 6:3) Moses was inspired to write the first five books of the Bible. Concerning him the Record savs: “And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord.” —Ex. 24:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Prior to Moses, the record of God’s dealings with men was handed down by tradition from generation to generation, so far as we can ascertain. Hence such tradition was admitted and accepted by men and women consecrated to God prior to the beginning of the writing of the Bible. (Gen. 18:17-19) According to what Moses’ written record shows, and also according to the apostle Paul’s record in the book of Hebrews, chapters eleven and twelve, Abel was the first witness of Jehovah. He was such before the Bible began to be written. Nevertheless, the word of God existed prior to even the birth of Abel. Abel received the word, believed it, and acted upon it, devoting himself to Jehovah and worshiping him and bearing witness to his purpose. That word of God had been given orally in the garden of Eden, when Jehovah God foretold the doom of that Old Serpent the Devil and the triumph of Christ Jesus, the Seed of God. God said to the serpent: “Epon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Gen. 3:14,15) Such statement of God’s purpose, and all his later promises to men of faith, were handed down by tradition until Amram, the father of Moses. When Moses wrote, he embodied all such tradition in the record. The spirit of inspiration of God caused Moses to discard all traditions of men which were at variance with God’s declared purpose, and to set down in writing the truthful record. Such would be to the glory of God and for the instruction and safe guidance of Jehovah God’s covenant people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1T</sup> Under the power of Jehovah’s spirit Moses both declared and wrote this promise to God’s visible organization of his covenant people: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deut. 18:15-19) Christ Jesus was and is that Prophet, and, like Moses, he is a witness for Jehovah, being, in fact, Jehovah’s Chief Witness. (Isa. 55:4) Jesus said to the religious Jews who persecuted him: “Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me. For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”—John 5:16, 39,46,47, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jesus did not condemn or reprove those Jews for searching the Scriptures, but for refusing to believe the Scriptures and to see their fulfillment in Him. At the synagogue in Nazareth Jesus read out of the prophecy of Isaiah and notified the congregation that the prophecy was fulfilled in Him. (Luke 4:16-21) It is true there is no record to show that Jesus and his disciples carried the books or volumes of the Bible around with them on their preaching tours. That fact, however, does not mean that they laid aside God's written Word as unnecessary and considered themselves as more important than the Bible. They did not require the people to accept their preaching without consideration of the proof from the Bible. To the direct contrary! After Jesus was baptized and was driven by God’s spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil, Jesus met all the onslaughts of the Devil by quoting from the Bible and by following the lead of that written Word of God. He did not quote any oral tradition of men, but resisted each temptation of the adversary, saying, “It is written,” and then putting the right interpretation upon God’s Word. The Devil, realizing the</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18. (a) Did Jesus condemn or reprove those Jews for searching the Scriptures, and is it an argument against the written Bible that he and his disciples did not carry it about? (b) How did Jesus meet the tempter’s attacks and keep integrity? </span><span class="font5">binding power of the Scriptures upon God’s covenant people, of whom Jesus was a member, also quoted some scriptures, but he put the wrong, misleading interpretation upon such quoted texts. (Matt.4:1-11) By abiding unshakably upon the written Bible Jesus overcame the tempter and maintained his integrity toward Jehovah God. He proved himself worthy to be the Vindicator, not only of Jehovah's name, but also of Jehovah’s written Word, inasmuch as His name is inseparably attached to that Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Continually thereafter, throughout all his preaching, Jesus referred to God's written Word and quoted from it. This is what caused Jesus’ word to be “with power”, producing astonishment: “for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.” (Luke 4:32; Matt. 7:29) On the day of his resurrection from the dead, when walking with two of his disciples, he said: “Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?” “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.” Later, that same day, he appeared to his faithful apostles, and “he said unto them. These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.” (Luke 24:26,27, 44, 45) Never did he admit of any traditions of men, but he placed God's written Word above religious traditions. He termed such traditions </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">leaven</span><span class="font5"> and instructed his disciples to beware of such.—Matt. 15:1-9; 16:6-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> In considering the above facts, bear in mind that Jesus was the beginning of Jehovah’s church; for Jesus Christ is the Head of it and also its RockFoundation. He pointed out to all his apostles that he is the Rock and Stone foretold in the inspired prophecies, and then he said to them: “Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matt. 16:18) In harmony with those prophecies the apostle Peter agreed that Christ Jesus is such Rock and Stone. (Acts 4: 12; 1 Pet. 2:3-9) Additionally, the apostle Paul testified concerning Jesus: “He is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have pre-eminence.” (Col. 1:17,18) In the clear light of the above facts, can it be Scripturally maintained that “the church of Christ is independent of the Bible, that it existed before the Bible”? Absolutely no! Centuries before Christ the Hebrew canon or catalog of inspired books was completed and brought together. Jesus had many disputes with the scribes or Bible copyists, but the fact that those scribes had made some copies of the Hebrew canon of the Scriptures does not argue that they made the Bible or were its creators, or that they preserved the Bible. Those very scribes opposed Jesus and were the Devil’s instruments to make null and void the commandments of God by the traditions of men, which traditions also those scribes copied and wrote. By such they hid from the people the true meaning of the inspired Scriptures. (Mark 7:1-13) The same thing is true of the copyist monks in religious systems down to the fifteenth century A. D.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Of course, the present-day Bible of sixty-six inspired books was not complete in Jesus’ day. The twenty-seven books thereof written originally in Greek by Jesus’ disciples were added later. Until such books were written and added, those hearing the apostles preach could receive only the oral tradition from them concerning Jesus as the Christ of God. Concerning such apostolic tradition Paul writes to the congregation at Thessalonica, Greece, saying: “Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.” “Now we co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">and you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.”—2 Thess. 2:15; 3: 6,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The traditions the apostle conveyed to the church were not traditions of men. The apostle had discarded all such when he became a Christian and quit persecuting the church of God. He so states, at Galatians 1:11-16. The traditions he imparted were “not after man” and not from “flesh and blood”. The apostle Paul wrote more information to the church than any other apostle, but he did not consider the church to be “independent of the Bible”. In all his apostolic letters he continually quoted from the Hebrew canon of the Bible. He pointed to the fulfillment and application thereof upon Christ Jesus and the “body of Christ”, the church. Paul’s fellow disciples, who also wrote under inspiration to the church, likewise made copious quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. In preaching “publicly, and from house to house”, Paul faithfully relied upon and quoted from those written Scriptures: “for he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">21. Why and how was the Bible completed? and till then bow must hearers of the testimony concerning Jesus get the Information<sup>9 </sup>22. (a) What were the traditions the apostle conveyed to tbe cburcb, and bow did be show whether it was independent of the Bible<sup>9</sup> (b&gt; How did the early believers show whether they considered tbe cburcb independent of tbe Bible? </span><span class="font5">scriptures that Jesus was Christ.” (Acts 18:28) When Paul delivered to listeners of good-will the oral traditions concerning Christ he did not do so independently of the Bible. He did not preach contrary to it or to what he himself had previously written under inspiration of God. (Gal. 1:6-9) Neither did the true believers accept his oral tradition without proof from God’s recorded Word. For example, the religionists at Thessalonica, who swallowed without Scripture proof the traditions of their religious fathers, rejected the message Paul spoke, whereas the persons of good-will at Berea accepted Paul’s message. Why? Because they did not consider themselves “independent of the Bible”. “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.”—Acts 17:11; see Romans 1:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” The indispensable part performed by God’s Word toward the very life and existence of the Christian church is declared by Jesus and his apostles. Said Jesus: “Except a man be born of water [the water of God’s word] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5) Says Paul: “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” “Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.” (Rom. 10:17; Eph. 5:25,26) Says James: “Of his own will begat he [God] us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”—Jas. 1:18,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah God provided the Bible as spiritual food for the church, because they need it continually. He did not say in any part of his Word that the church could or “would continue to exist unchanged without the Bible”. True, the Roman Catholic organization has, by God’s permission, existed till now “without the Bible”, but not so as to the true church, which is built upon the Rock, Christ Jesus. It sticks to the Bible and refuses to be changed by the traditions of religious men. To those composing the true church of God the apostle Paul writes: “Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” (Rom. 1:7; 15:4) To the young man Timothy he wrote: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&quot; (2 Tim. 2:15,16; 3:14,15) The apostle Peter showed he was in agreement with what Paul wrote, because Peter wrote approvingly of the letters of Paul. Like that apostle, Peter also quoted freely from the holy scriptures written aforetime, and he sought diligently to divide rightly God’s word of truth.—2 Pet. 3:15,16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Completely contrary to discouraging Bible study, the faithful apostles strongly urged for the faithful and continual study of the holy Word of God. That Word now includes the inspired books and letters written by the apostles and their associates. It is the Devil and his demons that would take away from the people the recorded Word of Jehovah God. Religion is the Devil’s most subtle way of taking away that Word and substituting for it the human traditions of demon worship. The far-sighted Jehovah God lovingly and wisely provided his written Word as an unchanging guiding light that his faithful servants and witnesses might not be misled by the traditions of false guides under demon control, but might be unerringly led in the way that conducts one to divine approval and life eternal. Says Peter: “We have not followed cunningly devised fables, . . . We have also a more sure word of prophecy, where-unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:16-19) Thus Peter does not agree with the religious organization which teaches that 'the church is independent of the Bible, existed before the Bible, and will keep on existing unchanged without it’, and which religious organization therefore commands its parishioners to believe and obey what it says rather than what God’s written Word says.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’* Such religious organization is governed by men who have changed from the Bible and who want to hold or sidetrack the people from the Bible so as to keep them ignorant of the change made. Such men are the modern counterparts of the religious scribes, Pharisees and lawyers to whom Jesus said: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” “Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.”—Matt. 23:13; Luke 11:52.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">26 Why does that religious organization want to keep the people from the Bible? and of whom are such religionists the modern counter parts?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HIGHEST TRIBUNAL OF INTERPRETATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> Since the invention of printing from movable type in the fifteenth century, and since the rise of Bible publishing and distributing societies from and after the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Bible has been circulated in more than a thousand popular languages all over the earth by the hundreds of millions of copies. Particularly from and after A.D. 1918 Jehovah’s witnesses, by the use of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society as their publishing agency, have spread the printed explanations of the Bible throughout the earth in over eighty different languages by the hundreds of millions of copies of books, booklets, magazines and tracts, and by use of scores of radio transmitters and also phonographically recorded Bible lectures. The religious hierarchy of the Vatican, being unable to prevent the proclamation of God’s Word, further belittles Bible study by the common people by ascribing to itself infallibility and by claiming that it is the only organization authorized and qualified to interpret the Bible. In support of such religious assumption the late Cardinal Gibbons, in his widely circulated book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font5"> writes, in Chapter XI, entitled “Infallibility of the Popes’’, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In a word, the Sovereign Pontiff is to the Church, though in a more eminent degree, what the Supreme Court is to the United States. We have an instrument called the Constitution of the United States, which is the charter of our civil rights and liberties. If a controversy arise regarding a constitutional clause, the question is referred in the last resort, to the Supreme Court at Washington. The Chief Justice, with his associate judges, examines into the case and then pronounces judgment upon it; and this decision is final, irrevocable and practically infallible. If there were no such court to settle constitutional questions, the Constitution itself would soon become a dead letter. Every litigant would conscientiously decide the dispute in his own favor and anarchy, separation and civil war would soon follow. But by means of this Supreme Court disputes are ended, and the political union of the States is perpetuated. . . . The revealed Word of God is the constitution of the Church. This is the Magna Charta of our Christian liberties. The Pope is the official guardian of our religious constitution, as the Chief Justice is the guardian of our civil constitution.”—Pages 124, 125, Eighty-third Edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The above comparison of the religious hierarchy with the Supreme Court of the American democracy does not hold true. Also the Hierarchy’s reference to itself as the “divinely-established supreme tribunal” in the matter of interpretation of the Bible is unscriptural. On this issue be these points observed: (1) The Supreme Court is a creature of the Constitution of the United States, by the Article III, Section I, thereof. In contrast with that, the religious hierarchy of Vatican City is not a creature of God’s revealed Word, the Bible; for the Bible condemns religion and is the foe of any hierarchy of religious leaders. (1 Pet. 5:1-4) The Bible existed before Christ’s church, and existed still longer before the religious hierarchy, whereas the Hierarchy claims it existed before the Bible. (2) The Supreme Court does not take larger powers than the Constitution allows it. The Hierarchy, however, assumes to itself powers in heaven, earth and hell, including a so-called “Purgatory”, which powers are unscriptural, being based on the wresting of some scriptures and upon the unfounded traditions of religious fathers of the Hierarchy. (3) The Supreme Court magnifies the Constitution, contends for its preservation, clarifies its meaning, and encourages a study of it by all the citizenry of the nation. The Hierarchy, though, weakens the authority and unique position of the Bible. It declares that the Bible is not sufficient and contains only the partial truth, and that it must be filled out by ecclesiastical traditions, and that hence Scripture and tradition jointly constitute the rule of faith; also that the decisions of the pope from his seat of authority in matters of faith and morals are of equal authority with the Bible and are infallible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> No religious or other organization has tried harder than the Hierarchy to keep the Bible from the people and to prevent or discourage Bible study. Countless burnings both of Bibles and of students of the Bible are listed in the criminal record of the Hierarchy. As late as A.D. 1940 the Nazi-Fascist-religious dictator of Spain did, with the Hierarchy’s approval, cause 110,000 copies of the Bible, which were sent to Spain for distribution, to be destroyed and ground to pulp. (N.Y. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> October 6, 1940)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> Finally, (4) the Supreme Court is obligated to abide by the Constitution and to rule against any and all violations of it; and it cannot abrogate, annul, abolish or repeal that document. On the other hand, the Hierarchy does not abide by the Bible, but makes it null and void by adopting traditions of man and also the rites, ceremonies and paraphernalia of demonism. It opposes and seeks to destroy all those who faithfully obey and publish the truths and commandments of the Bible. Certainly, then, no such religious system could reasonably be infallible like</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">29 . What record, even till as late as 1940, shows up the effort of the Hierarchy to keep out the Bible and its study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">30 On what fourth point does comparison of the Hierarchy with the Supreme Court not hold true? </span><span class="font5">the Bible, nor could it be the divinely guided interpreter of that inspired Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; The claim of any individual or religious organization to be the interpreter of God’s sacred Word is false and misleading. No creature or organization on earth can truly presume to sit as the supreme tribunal of interpretation of the Holy Bible. Jehovah God, the Supreme Judge, has set up no such supreme court of interpretation upon our planet. His Associate Judge, Christ Jesus, has appointed no so-called “vicar&quot;’ or “vicegerent&quot;’ to act for him as interpreter to His church. In ancient time the faithful Hebrew Joseph said: “Do not interpretations belong to God!” When called before Pharaoh of Egypt to give an interpretation he said: “It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.” (Gen. 40:8; 41:16) Centuries thereafter the apostle Peter related how God caused the fulfillment of prophecy to take place respecting Christ Jesus and how thereby God gave the interpretation of the prophecy. Then the apostle Peter added: “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy [spirit].”—2 Pet. 1:19-21. (See also Acts 15:5-18.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah God is therefore the only Supreme Court of interpretation of His inspired Word. Regarding God's exclusive place Christ Jesus his Son said in the prophecy concerning the end of the world and the time of the final war of Armageddon: “Heaven and earth shall pass auay: but my words shall not pass away. But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.” (Mark 13:31,32) The heavenly Father chose to call into his service his beloved Son as his divinely inspired Interpreter of the whole Word of God. He foretold his Son acting in such capacity. In the prophetic drama of Job God used Job to portray how the faithful remnant today of the Christian church would suffer great affliction, reproach and persecution at the hands of the Devil and his religious dupes on earth. In the drama God then raised up the young man Elihu. God inspired Elihu to utter a prophecy concerning the end of the world, the time when Jehovah’s witnesses would be hated of all nations and would be in great affliction and in need of enlightenment on the Bible. “Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: then he is gracious unto him. and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.” (Job 33:22-24) That messenger and interpreter and ransom is Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Judge at the temple.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MANNER OF INTERPRETATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The Scriptures prophesied that Jehovah’s Messenger, Interpreter and Judge would come to the spiritual temple of God. Many facts in fulfillment of prophecy prove that he came thither in A.D. 1918, spring. (See Malachi 3:1-4; Revelation 11:18,19.) Malachi’s prophecy shows that Christ Jesus would sit as a refiner of silver, that is, of the Word of God. Not that the written Word of God is impure, but that those seeking to understand God’s Word had unwittingly commingled so many impurities of religion with their beliefs. Therefore those fully consecrated to God and dedicated to his service needed purification from all soils and taints of religion. Such defiling had attached to them from the great religious confusion that set in shortly after the death of the apostles and their faithful associates. (Acts 20: 28-31; 2 Thess. 2: 2-12) At Christ's coming to the temple in 1918 he gathered before him for judgment all professing Christians, because “judgment must begin at the house of God”. (1 Pet. 4:17) He foretold that he would judge them by his word, which is the Word of God. This Christ Jesus does by acting as Interpreter of God's Word and making clear the meaning and message of the Bible, to magnify Jehovah’s name and purpose and His Theocratic Government or Kingdom.—Isa. 42:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The time of Christ’s coming into his kingdom and then coming to the temple is a time for the grand fulfillment of the prophecies telling of the establishment of The Theocracy and the end of Satan's world organization. It is accordingly the time of revealing and publishing the truth, and hence the time of interpreting the prophecies. (Dan. 12:1-4) In ancient days Jehovah God used some visible channel for making known his truth and interpretations to his consecrated people. Jehovah God does not change his rule of action, and he uses a like channel at this end of the world. What is that channel or visible agency! Christ Jesus described it when giving his prophecy on the visible evidences that would mark the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule and the setting up of the Theocratic Government. Our inspired Master and Interpreter said: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">33. When did Jehovah’s Messenger and Interpreter come to the temple, and bow baa he sat and acted as a refiner of silver?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">34. (a) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The time of Christ's coming to the temple is the time for what treatment of the truth, and what does God use for that purpose<sup>9 </sup>(b) Under wbat prophetic expression did Jesus describe that visible agency? </span><span class="font5">over his household, to give them meat in due season! Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” (Matt. 24:45-47; see also Luke 12:42-44) Whom do the facts of our day prove to be that “faithful and wise servant”!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Aside from Christ Jesus, divine prophecy foretells no individual man. In times past prophetic figures such as Elijah, Elisha, and others, were used to foreshadow a company or society of faithful, devoted servants of God, who should be Jehovah’s witnesses at the end of the world, where we are at present. Likewise, the expression “faithful and wise servant” does not picture any man or individual on earth now, but means the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses who are begotten of His spirit and gathered into a unity unto Him and His service. They are part of his Theocratic organization and are subject to Theocratic rule, which means, the divine will as to organization and work. They act as a unit or society, together doing Jehovah’s “strange world’ as he reveals it to them. (Isa. 54:13; Ps. 25:14) Such “society” is not a legal society or corporation, chartered according to the laws of some state or nation, but is a society or association formed by the Creator, Jehovah God, and composed of his spiritual remnant approved by Christ Jesus at the temple judgment. Such society, however, may use as their earthly instrumentality or servant a legal corporation, such as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society; and they do so, since A.D. 1884. Christ Jesus is the Chief Servant of Jehovah God, and he is the invisible or heavenly Head of the “faithful and vise servant” class.—Isa. 42:1; Matt. 12:15-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> To such remnant of faithful servants of Jehovah God Christ Jesus has entrusted all “his goods”, or earthly interests of the Kingdom. This does not signify that the faithful remnant or society of Jehovah's anointed witnesses are an earthly tribunal of interpretation, delegated to interpret the Scriptures and its prophecies. No; Christ Jesus the King has not entrusted that office to them. The Supreme Court still interprets, thank God; and Christ Jesus, the Court's official mouthpiece of interpretation, reserves to himself that office as Head of Jehovah’s “faithful and wise servant” class. He merely uses the “servant” class to publish the interpretation after the Supreme Court by Christ Jesus reveals it. How does the Lord God make known the interpretation ? By causing the facts to come to pass visibly which are in fulfillment of the prophecy or dark saying or misunderstood scripture. Thereafter “in due season” he calls such fulfillment or clarification of prophecy and scripture to the attention of his “faithful and wise servant” class. Thereby he makes them responsible to make known the meaning of such scriptures to all members of the household of faith and to all persons of goodwill. This constitutes giving them the “meat in due season”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">*’ In bygone days those now composing the “faithful and wise servant” class or remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses have believed many things which were not strictly correct according to the Scriptures. They continued to hold on to such beliefs even for some time after A.D. 1918, when Christ Jesus arrived at the temple. Today they see and understand differently, with Scripture backing. Does this mean that God is the Author of confusion or that they are not of His Theocratic organization! No; Jehovah God is not the author of confusion, but is the remover of confusion from his devoted people who both pray and seek to know his truth. Although the understanding of his “servant” class has cleared up and has been corrected, yet the text of God’s infallible Word has not changed and its information has been there all the time from days of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After Jehovah’s royal Associate Judge came to the temple for judgment and the purification of his people, Jehovah God used his Messenger and Interpreter to cleanse away, little by little and point by point, any misunderstanding, which misunderstanding was due to their having been in contact with religion in the past or due to not having the fulfilled facts at hand because it was not yet God’s due time. Thus Jehovah by Christ Jesus continues to this day to lead them in the path of truth, and they follow the revealed decisions of the Supreme Court of Interpretation and walk on in the light. Such increase of light is in fulfillment of God’s promise: “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Prov. 4:18) The light continues to grow brighter, and the perfect day is at hand, as we walk on where our Guide and Intel-preter leads us.—Ps. 25: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Thus the great Supreme Interpreter magnifies now his infallible Word. Shortly, at the battle of Armageddon, Jehovah by his Associate Judge and Executioner will vindicate that Word. He will also magnify his holy name and destroy all opposing kings of this world. For that reason his faithful remnant, who are in line to be “kings and priests” with Christ Jesus, bow toward Jehovah God, who is representatively in his holy temple by Christ Jesus. Their beloved earthly companions bow with them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">37 . Why does difference of understanding today from that held previously not prove God the author of confusion or prove that the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses are not of His organization’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">38 How, then, do we explain Scripturally the change of understanding since the Lord's coming to the temple’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">30. What is the Supreme Interpreter thereby doing respecting bls Word’ and for that cause what do the remnant and their faithful companions do respecting Jehovah God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and all together they say: &quot;I will worship toward ttiy kindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified holy temple, and praise thy name for thy loving- thy word above all thy name.”—Ps. 138:2.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENTS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE kingdom of God is the highest government any creature can serve. All kingdom service to be acceptable must find its motive in love for the Lord. The intelligent creature desiring to be pleasing to God must always have this fact foremost in his mind. The call to action going forth to the Lord’s people throughout the earth at this time is a righteous call, and action is a righteous requirement. This call to action the Lord’s people have received particularly since October, 1938. In 1938 the Lord through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> presented indisputable Scriptural proof establishing the fact that Jehovah is the great Theocrat, that Christ Jesus is his anointed King, and that in 1918 the King came to his temple class composed of the consecrated, spirit-begotten and anointed members of his body. These he has judged, cleansed and commissioned to act as his “faithful and wise servant”. —Matt. 24.45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This servant he has placed over his earthly household and has given him charge over all his goods with specific instructions to bring forth “meat in due season” for the household of faith. The servant was also anointed “to preach good tidings unto the meek; ... to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn”.—Isa. 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures and the facts clearly establish that the commission given to the “faithful and wise servant” is grounded in the Word of the Lord. There is only one organization on earth today fulfilling the righteous requirements outlined in this commission from the Lord. The Society, represented by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, is the only one</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preaching good tidings unto the meek, Binding up the brokenhearted, Proclaiming liberty to the captives, Proclaiming the opening of the prison to those that are bound,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proclaiming the acceptable year of the Lord, Proclaiming the day of vengeance of our God, and Comforting all that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Society” is composed of the Lord’s consecrated, spirit-begotten and anointed servants, and is the “faithful and wise servant” class, who, under the leadership of Jehovah’s commissioned King Christ Jesus, are fulfilling this commission. We should not expect more than one organization doing this work, and the fact that there is no other proves clearly who is the “faithful and wise servant” whom the Lord places over his household. The Lord did not commission a number of servants to act for him, nor did he scatter his work and goods over a great many organizations. No 1 There could be only one “servant”; and as Jephthah demonstrated that he was the Lord’s choice by doing the Lord’s work in the spirit and power of the Lord, so the Society today clearly demonstrates to all who have the mind of the Lord and are interested in the vindication of Jehovah’s name that it is the Lord’s choice and is his “faithful and wise servant” doing the work of the Lord in the power and spirit of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Society was authorized by the Lord to bring forth things new and old for the household of faith and do the work for which the Lord had organized it. Therefore it is fully qualified and duly authorized to issue a “call to action” to all who claim to be on the Lord’s side to busy themselves in doing the work of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This “call to action” sent out by the Lord through the Society is based on the fulfilled prophecies of his Word clearly revealed to those who have the mind of the Lord, by sueh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles as the prophecy of Daniel 11:27-45, “Micah,” “Song-Call to Action,” “Defeat of Persecution,” “The Only Light,” “Fighter for the New World,” etc. These thrilling prophecies were called to our attention during the past year and clearly reveal the Lord's requirements for those who are under the leadership of his King, These are, therefore, right and righteous requirements to every<sup>7</sup> consecrated servant of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How does the Lord issue the call to his people! Does it come in the form of a harsh ultimatum: You do thus and so, or else—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> No! Sueh ultimatums are not necessary The Lord never adopts that attitude toward his servants, and no one else has a right to. Much trouble in company organizations would be avoided if all of the Lord’s people could appreciate this point. Those who really love the Lord do not require any such treatment. Of them it is written, “Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.” (Ps. 73:24) Those who do not loie the Lord and are opposed to his kingdom, the Lord does not want in his service. Of such the Lord says, “What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?”—Ps. 50.16</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This call is therefore for those who love the Lord and rejoice in his righteous requirements and who wish to Ine in and accept the responsibilities of the New World. Such show their faith and faithfulness by their response to the call to action. When this class sees the issue and hears the call, that is all that is necessary. Jesus says of them, Tor they know the good shepherd’s voice, and a stranger will they not follow.’ (John 10:4,5) The Lord always issues his call to action in an organized, systematic manner. This is emphasized throughout the Bible, from the opening chapters of Genesis to the concluding chapters of Revelation. Let us consider one or two by way of illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Genesis 1:26 Jehovah issued a “call to action” to his Son, the Logos, and such other agencies as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">weie required</span><span class="font5"> for the creation of man, in these words: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” This is all there was to it. Jehovah expressed his will. That expressed will became “organization instructions” to the Logos. It was at that time that “the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy”. (Job 38:7) Another splendid illustration of Jehovah’s expressing his will, which expressed will became “organization instructions” to Jesus and all other servants of the Lord participating in the great drama, is the 110th Psalm, particularly the first three verses: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every organization requires specific instructions for all those who serve in it. In the past the Lord issued his “organization instructions” to his servants through his central agency or channel. Each one joyfully accepted his part therein and faithfully carried it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, the apostle says, Jehovah speaks to us through his Son. (Heb. 1:1, 2) The Son has returned as King; he has come to his temple. He has appointed his “faithful and wise servant”, who is his visible mouthpiece, and says to those who are privileged to represent him upon the earth, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations” (Matthew 24:14); and, “The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts” (Zech. 8:21) , and, “Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.”—Jer. 16:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These expressions of God’s will by his King and through his established agency constitute his law or rule of action for the “faithful and wise servant” and for their goodwill companions today who will dwell upon the earth for ever in the New World. The Lord breaks down our organization instructions further and makes them more practicable by further instructing us through his “faithful and wise servant”. He says, ‘Let us assign the field, the world, to special pioneers, regular pioneers and companies of Jehovah’s witnesses in an orderly way, sufficient for everyone to thoroughly witness therein, and let us place upon each one the responsibility of caring for the New World interests in these respective assignments.’ He says the requirements for special pioneers shall be 175 hours and 50 back-calls per month, which should develop into a reasonable number of studies; and for regular pioneers 150 hours and as many back-calls and studies as can be properly developed during that time. And for company publishers he says, ‘Let us make a quota of 60 hours and 12 back-calls and at least one study a week for each publisher.’ These directions come to us from the Lord through his established agency directing what is required of us; and, for those who really love the Lord and are guided by his counsel, that is a reasonable service requirement. This expression of the Lord’s will should be the end of all controversy. It is for your good that these requirements are made; for thereby you are enabled to prove your integrity and magnify the Lord’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These directions from the Lord come to us as individuals and as collective units called “companies”. Almost everyone who is consecrated to the Lord recognizes that a company requires organization in order to function properly, but not all of these same brethren appreciate the fact that they as individuals require just as complete an organization to carry out their individual responsibilities as the company does. To illustrate: All realize that every company should have a definite assignment of territory in which to witness, but not all appreciate that each individual in that company should have his or her own personal assignment of territory in which to witness. It is just as foolish for a publisher to conclude that he can serve the Lord properly without a personal assignment as it would be for a company to decide that it could function acceptably to the Lord without a territory assignment. A company is required to have an assignment and to systematically work in it from house to house, make back-calls, conduct book studies, and generally aid the people of good-will. They are to carry on all the forms of magazine work in that assignment. They logically hold their own city and such adjacent territory as they can properly handle. It would be the height of foolishness for them to leave their own city and go to a city twenty miles away held by someone else and try to systematically witness in it. Every intelligent person will admit that that would be not only foolishness but rank unfaithfulness to the Lord. The same principle applies to the publisher who refuses to accept the responsibility for a personal assignment of territory and have that assignment as close as possible to his home. The farther away from his home that assignment is, the less time he will have to devote to it and the more difficult it will be to give proper attention to the interest in the territory, Consequently, it is a measure of unfaithfulness to the Lord to thus waste time and energy that belongs to him</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time has come when each one must bear his own burden fully before the Lord. With the provisions that the Lord has now made in supplying us with new books, question booklets which contain complete instructions for properly carrying on a study, etc., there is absolutely no excuse for anyone, man or woman, to claim to be unable to accept an individual territory assignment and assume full responsibility for it. Those who really love the Lord and are fighters for the New World will not try to excuse themselves on that or any other ground, but will hear the Word of the Lord when he says, Let </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">us </span><span class="font5">do thus and so, and always keep m mind the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font5"> includes the Lord, who will be with you in every undertaking. —Matthew 18: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord through his “faithful and wise servant” now states to us, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let</span><span class="font5"> us </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cover our territory four times</span><span class="font5"> m six </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">months.”</span><span class="font5"> That becomes our organization instructions and has the same binding force on us that his statement to the Logos had when he said, “Let us make man in our image.” It is our duty to accept this additional instruction and obey it. But someone will say, “The conditions are different. In the ease of the Logos, he could accomplish what Jehovah commanded him to do; but when it comes to covering our territory four times in six months, that is out of all reason. We have never covered it more than once or, at the most, twice in six months. It just can’t be done.” We have all heard that argument before. And if it were true it would look bad indeed, and would imply that the Lord was asking us to do something that is impossible for us to accomplish. The children of Israel walked around Jericho seven times the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">last</span><span class="font5"> day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The territory now being covered one to two times in six months could very easily be covered four to six times in the same period if everyone took his Kingdom responsibilities seriously. This is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> theory, but actual facts based on figures gleaned from a number of companies during the past six months. Psalm 11612-18 seems worthy of consideration here: &quot;What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I wifi pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. 0 Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To do this may mean taking time and effort that is now being devoted to “old world” interests and transferring them to New World interests, which are of God and shall abide for ever. The words of the apostle Peter are to the point in this respect: “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?&quot; (2 Peter 3:11) Before real progress will be made in increasing our activity we must each one recognize these calls to action as coming from the Lord and applying to us personally, and respond to them wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New World Government is 29 years old. Consequently it should be kept before the minds of the people at all times by calling at their homes and telling them about it, by making back-calls and conducting studies with them, by working business territory and calling on them in their offices. They should be witnessed to on the streets with our magazines, publishers presenting the message of the New World. No matter where they go, the people should have always before them the evidence that the New World Government has begun to function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just as the pile of stones in the midst of Jordan made it necessary for the on-rushing flood to continually roll over them and between them as it rushed on, so today, no matter where the people turn, in their homes, in their businesses, on the streets or in the stores, they are confronted by the evidence of the New World Government in operation represented by its servants “holding forth the word of life’’. The people of good-will among men will see, hear, and turn aside and take their stand for The Theocracy; and the servants of the Lord will be blameless in this day of the Lord because they have, by God’s grace, done their part in meeting the righteous requirements of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ISAAC, A PROPHETIC FIGURE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH GOD made the prophetic statement to Satan in Eden, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Gen. 3:15) Faithful men of old looked forward to the coming of that Seed who would crush the Serpent and destroy his organization, and thus deliver obedient men from its oppressive rule and vindicate Jehovah’s name. Some of these faithful witnesses of old were used by the Almighty God to prefigure that promised Seed, Christ Jesus. One of such was Isaac, Abraham's seed. (Gal. 3:16) This being true, and the present-day physical facts testifying that these are the last days and the time when the bruising of Satan and his hordes will occur and when deliverance and vindication will come through the promised Seed, consideration of the life of Isaac is not mere ancient history, but is of prophetic significance and very timely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaac was the only son of Abraham by his b?loved wife Sarah. He was a child of promise and was foretold to Abraham when that patriarch was 99 years old. (Gen. 17:1, 19) When Sarah was 90 years of age and Abraham was 100 Isaac was born. It was a miracle performed by Jehovah, for Abraham’s body was as good as dead so far as children were concerned and likewise Sarah was beyond the age of childbearing. Abraham’s faith in God’s promise was unwavering. “Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred yeajs old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb.&quot; —Rom. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The birth of Isaac was a source of great joy to the aged couple, and particularly to Sarah, who had been without child heretofore. It was a reproach to a woman to be barren. Jehovah God had now removed that reproach, and Sarah rejoiced. “Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.” The name “Isaac&quot; means “laughter”. Sarah’s faith in God’s promise had been rewarded.—Heb. 11:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first event recorded in the life of Isaac is that he, at the age of five years, was mocked by Ishmael, a son of Abraham by Hagar the Egyptian, and hence Isaac’s half brother. Sarah was a witness of the derisive taunts of Ishmael and demanded of Abraham that this bondwoman and her son be cast out, that her son should not be heir with Isaac. The Lord directed Abraham to hearken to the wishes of Sarah in the matter, and, accordingly, Hagar and Ishmael were sent away. The mocking of Isaac was an important event in that it marked the beginning of the fulfillment of a prophecy uttered by Jehovah to Abraham. “Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out w ith great substance.” (Gen. 15 :13, 14) That period of affliction upon the seed of Abraham ended with the exodus of the nation of Israel from Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps the most important event, so far as prophetic significance is concerned, was that Isaac was taken by Abraham to the land of Moriah to be a burnt offering, as Jehovah had commanded. Mt. Moriah, meaning “Jah provides”, was the place where Solomon later began the building of the temple. At the time Isaac was taken there he was a strong young man, while his father was aged. The youth might have successfully resisted his being sacrificed had he been disposed to do so, but the account does not disclose even so much as a verbal remonstrance on Isaac’s part. Hence he must have willingly submitted in obedience to the instructions the Lord had given to Abraham. (Genesis 22) At the very instant that the sacrificial knife was to take the life of the victim the angel of the Lord called to Abraham, halting the human sacrifice, and caused a ram to be substituted therefor. It was as though Isaac had returned from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Isaac was 37 years old his mother Sarah died. Three years later his marriage to Rebecca took place, and he was thereby comforted after the death of his mother. (Gen. 25:20; 24 : 67) The manner in which Isaac’s wife was selected is important, and in great contrast with the procedure followed in these days. Isaac’s father Abraham sent his most trusted servant unto the city of Nahor, in Mesopotamia, to choose his son’s wife. This servant was bound by solemn oath to take no wife for Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom Abraham dwelt. Who would direct the choice? Abraham said to his eldest servant, “He [Jehovah] shall send his angel before thee.” The circumstances surrounding the selection of Rebecca, the granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor, as recorded in the 24th chapter of Genesis, give indisputable proof that her choosing was directed by Jehovah God. Fully realizing this, both Rebecca and her family immediately consented to the proposed marriage and she left Mesopotamia and returned to Canaan with the servant to become Isaac’s wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For twenty years after her marriage Rebecca was barren, but then the Lord heard the entreaty of Isaac, and his wife conceived and bore twins, Esau and Jacob. (Gen 25: 21-26) When Isaac had grown old and his sight was dim and death seemed imminent, he bestowed his blessing upon Jacob, thinking him to be his elder son Esau. This was maneuvered by Rebecca and Jacob through a procedure which was directed by the Lord in fulfillment of a prophecy and for the making of a picture.—Gen. 25: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the divine record it is apparent that throughout his life Isaac was a peaceful man, and very meek. He was ill-treated by the Philistines, who were envious of the prosperity he enjoyed as a result of the Lord’s blessing. On more than one occasion he was forced by them to move, digging new wells and relocating himself in various sections of the land. He was the sole heir of Abraham. (Gen 25: 5) He also had repeated to him by Jehovah the promise made to his father, “I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 26:4) Isaac dwelt in tents; he had no fixed dwelling-place at that time, but was looking for a better habitation, Jehovah’s promised new world. (Heb. 11:9, 10) Isaac died in Hebron when 180 years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah with his parents and wife Rebecca.—Gen. 35: 27-29; 49: 30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this account of the life of Isaac, what facts stand out which show him to be prophetic of Christ Jesus, the promised Seed referred to in Eden? First, the manner of his birth. He was a child of promise, brought forth by a miracle of the Lord. (Gal. 4:28) His birth was the occasion for much joy. Christ Jesus’ human existence was promised Centuries before it took place and, he being brought forth by a virgin, was miraculous. As to the joy of that occasion, note the words of an angel of the Lord to the shepherds: “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people: for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” On that joyous event God's angels of his invisible organization rejoiced and sang praises to the Most High, as did Sarah at the birth of Isaac. (Luke 2:4-14; Gen. 21:6) Jehovah, pictured by Abraham, was surely gladdened by the birth of Jesus, as it was a forward step in the out-working of His purpose to vindicate His name. All the obedient ones of the earth will be blessed and rejoice in the provision of this promised Seed, Christ Jesus, their Redeemer-King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaac was mocked by Ishmael. Ishmael pictured the nation of Israel, which nation rejected Christ Jesus as earth’s rightful heir and mocked and taunted Him, ultimately instigating his death on the tree. (Mark 8:31; John 1:11) Even to this day unfaithful “Christendom”, like the nation of Israel, mocks and persecutes the remnant of the Seed, or Christ “body”. (Gal. 3:29; 4:29; Rev. 12:17) All those who mock the poor in spirit, who make up The Theocracy, reproach God, and will be east out of the Greater Abraham’s household and will suffer destruction. “Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Abraham took Isaac to be sacrificed Jehovah was showing pictorially how He would in due time send his only begotten Son to the earth as a sin-offering, and that He would thereafter receive him back from the dead. (Heb 11:17-19) Three days after his sacrificial death Christ Jesus was resurrected from the grave, and forty days thence ascended into heaven to his Father and Life-giver Like Isaac, Jesus did not resist his Father’s purpose to sacrifice His Son, but meekly submitted, saying, “Thy will be done.” (Matt. 26:42; Isa. 53:7) For his faithfulness, Christ Jesus became “heir of all things”.—Heb. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “church”, the 144,000 members of Christ’s “body”, is the bride of Christ, or “the Lamb’s wife”. (Eph. 1: 22, 23, Col. 1:18; Rev. 14:1-4; 21:2,9,10) Those called to be a part of this “bride” class are selected and placed in that “body” by the Father of the Greater Isaac, Jehovah God (John 6: 44; 1 Cor. 12:18) Thus it is seen how Abraham’s choice of Isaac’s wife in the type is fulfilled in the antitype</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaac, to be sure, did not realize the part he was playing in the dramas Jehovah God was directing, but he had faith in God and submissively followed His leading The result is to Jehovah's glory and Isaac’s eternal welfare. Jehovah acknowledges that He is the God of Isaac, and that Isaac shall live again, forever, in His new world without end. “I am the God of . . . Isaac, . . Ged is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matt 22:31, 32) Many persons now living will see Isaac in Jehovah’s new world and will sit with him there in security and everlasting life. (Matt. 8:11) It strongly appears that many others, the religious elergy class of mockers and their blind followers, will see Isaac raised from the dead to be a prince of the New World, but will find themselves thrust out and destroyed at Armageddon. (Luke 13: 28) Will you sit with Isaac under Kingdom rule, or will you be thrust out? The course you follow now will determine your position then.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">evening. At the time appointed we called, but there was no answer; so we knocked next door, where her sister, Mrs. G., lives. No one was there. Disappointed, we tried another call, but without success. Once again we returned to Mrs. G.’s, and this time found her at home. She and her husband (home on leave) listened to a recorded lecture. She related to us how, with the help of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font5">both she and her husband learned to read. After this call we tried Mrs. K., next door, and found her in. She and her three children joined in a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book study. The second week Mrs. G. was at Mrs. K.’s when we called. All together, there were five in attendance, and many questions were asked. The third week there were two more children present, making a total attendance of seven. We gave each of these children, of ages ranging from five to thirteen, a question to prepare for the following week, and they eagerly looked forward to the study. Now Mrs. G. sends the literature regularly to her husband in the Forces.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN OUTLYING PARTS (KENTUCKY)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In Elliot county, as anyone knows who has been here, houses are located in some odd places. I was following a trail on top of a cliff, when far off and far below was a tiny cabin. I tried to get there, but there was seemingly no way down. So I finally found a large tree growing right up beside the cliff. I went over and slid down to the bottom, and so I got this house. Results were favorable. They were overjoyed that anyone would come all the way to their isolated home to bring them a message of hope. I left a booklet, as they just could not take a book. I was treated very nice, and they begged that I might come again soon. On another experience I left the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column</span><span class="font5"> with a Mason. Calling back later I found him very friendly. It being twilight, he insisted I spend the night with him. This I did. He told me how he had been preaching just what Rutherford said for 25 years; that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy were the cause of the trouble, etc. On another experience, I had called on a house many times but had not got anything except jeers. I called once more, thinking I might arouse a little interest, or at least present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.</span><span class="font5"> This I did, offering a sample of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine. The lady took it eagerly, promising to subscribe on my next call, as her husband was gone and she never had the money now. Another house I had passed by many times, said to be inhabited by a crazy person. It was neighborhood talk that Mrs. G. was crazy. One day I decided to call at this place. The first thing I saw was a Bible and several of our own books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Riches,</span><span class="font5"> etc. This lady then told me she had many years ago seen the hypocrisy in the churches, so she had her name taken off the church book. It was sometime later that a Jehovah’s witness came through and she availed herself of many of the books. Her husband was very angry, he hated all of Jehovah’s witnesses. So bad did conditions become that she moved out of her own home to live in what was once a henhouse. Her husband then circulated the rumor she was crazy. Since the outside world lost all sight of her, it was believed. Needless to say, this lady now has all the literature and gets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> from me regularly. Through back-calls she has heard most of the lectures. Yes, she still lives alone.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">208</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERCOMING OBSTACLES (SUPERIOR, ARIZ.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Superior is a very crowded mining camp. Practically all of our work is on foot over rough and rocky slopes and gullies. More than three-fourths of the people are Mexican, a surprising number of whom speak little or no English. Many superstitious customs and attitudes make it difficult at times to realize we are in the U. S. Two obstacles faced us: We could speak no Spanish; we could not get the interest of the men to attend studies, because of the rotation of the shifts at the mine. The Spanish phonograph recordings and testimony card made the door-to-door work easy; also the use of the Spanish magazines made the street and route work possible. However, to conduct studies, need of a working knowledge of Spanish was indicated. We exchanged magazine subscriptions for Spanish-language instruction books, arose a little earlier mornings to study them, and made diligent comparison of the Bible and Society's literature in both Spanish and English, and always, if a question arose which we could not answer in Spanish, we would find the answer in the English literature and Scriptures and then locate it in Spanish and let them read that. To get the men to attend the studies we rotated the time for each study group; that is, for two weeks a study group would meet at 9 a. m., another the next two weeks at 3 p. m., and the third the next two weeks at 8 p. m., and then rotate again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At present there are 16 book-study groups, some in Spanish, some mixed, and some in English. Also, we have a number of model Bible studies, and arrangements are now in progress for a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. Several are ready to engage in the witness work this month. We believe that a company will be functioning here before the summer is over. The majority of these sheep were previously ‘good Catholics’, who had never even seen a Bible. These had to be patiently instructed in how to find the Scripture texts. This knowledge, so new to them, they do not treat lightly. Much pressure has been put upon these by the priests and pastors here, who not only have denounced us and the work from the pulpits, but have deliberately called at the homes during studies and back-calls, unsuccessfully attempting to foment controversies. While some have been frightened into withdrawing, others inquire more fully. One eager lad of fourteen said, after being subjected to many sneers and much ridicule for attending a study group: ‘I see if I please myself, I cannot always please Jehovah. I want to please him and obey him.’ One woman began to study because she felt it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5"> be important indeed, for us to keep coming to her door and to go to so much trouble (from her viewpoint) to cause her to listen, even asking her to read about it on the streets.’’—Three special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ECHOES FROM ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Shortly after the banning of the New World Assembly in Manchester, while coming away from a back-call in the slums of Manchester, another Kingdom publisher and myself saw these words written on a factory wall: ‘If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you. God bless Jehovah’s witnesses. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life!’ ”—G. C., pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One Sunday morning I placed a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book with Mrs. K. and arranged a back-call the following Monday</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ m glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the light to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Chnst Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Chnst Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth&quot; with a righteous race</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>KINGDOM SIGN OF THE SERVANTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the ivorld for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</span><span class="font4"> TT7io </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler ote&gt; his household, to give them meat in due season?”—Matt. 24:14,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the Everlasting King, who holds universal domination. ’The Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and king of eternity, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.&quot; (Jer. 10:10, marginal reading) Jehovah God is the Author of the kingdom that shall rid all creation of every rebel against his universal domination.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Thousands of years ago the universal King fixed unchangeably the time for the establishment of the Kingdom in the hands of his Son, Christ Jesus. The Royal Record definitely shows that such time was to be at the end of the uninterrupted rule of this world by Satan the Devil. At that same time the uninterrupted “seven times&quot; of the Gentile domination of this globe would expire. Such end was readied in the autumn of A. D. 1914. There the Lord God Almighty took to himself his great power and began reigning, and the kingdom of the promised new world became the active, operating kingdom of our Lord Jehovah and of his Christ. (Rev. 11: 15-18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. </span><span class="font4">Ter.) You ask: ‘What are the proofs of this? To what signs can you point?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Signs are necessary to discern this wondrous fact. We cannot see with our naked eyes Jehovah God himself reigning on his exalted throne of the universe. When, long ago, the prophet Isaiah had simply a vision of the Lord God seated upon his throne in the temple, the prophet was deathly afraid that his destruction was impending. He cried out: “Wo to me, for I have been silent, for a man—unclean of lips am I, and in midst of a people unclean of lips I am dwelling, because the King, Jehovah of Hosts, have my eyes seen.” (Isa. 6:1-5, Young's translation) The great King of Eternity has ever been “dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting&quot;. (1 Tim. 6: 16) His Son, to whom Jehovah gives the kingdom of the new world, is the One “by whom also he made the worlds;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 What is Jehovah's relationship to all the living universei </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> As fixed by Jehovah God. at what time was the establishment of the Kingdom to take place, and at that time what took place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3 Why are signs necessary to discern that wondrous fact? </span><span class="font4">who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels”.—Heb. 1: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* It is equally impossible, and ever will be impossible, for human creatures on this earth to see with the naked human eye Jehovah’s resurrected Son, Christ Jesus, on his Kingdom throne. It is possible, however, to perceive or discern that fact by the eye of faith, faith in God’s Word as backed up by the signs of our day. But those lacking love of God’s kingdom and blinded by selfishness and admiration of human vanities refuse to exercise faith and see, just as selfish men failed to see or discern that Christ Jesus is King when he was amomx them on earth as a man. “Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias [Isaiah] said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. These things said Esaias. when he saw his [Jehovah’s] glory, and spake of him.” (John 12:39-41) Consequently, amid the battle clouds of Armageddon it will become necessary for Christ to make every eye see -or discern the fact that he has come into his kingdom. When all ‘those who pierced him’ and all kindreds of the earth are forced to see that fact they will see they are fighting against Jehovah’s reigning King and that the war clouds of divine wrath are thundering destruction for them. Then they will all wail, in bitterness, but not in repentance. —Rev. 1: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGNS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Since Jehovah’s anointed King and his Theocratic kingdom are invisible to man’s physical eyes, God in his grace and helpfulness provides abundant and overwhelming signs in proof that Satan’s uninterrupted rule or world has ended and the Government </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4. What ii it that keeps men from discerning that fact? and when and how will they be forced to see that fact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5 What ia the course of those who heed and those who do not heed the signs’ and what particular sign speaks most loudly today ? </span><span class="font4">of the new world has been established. Those who see the signs and who wisely heed their portent will zealously serve the King and the Kingdom. Those who selfishly blind themselves to the signs and defy their meaning will show indifference to the Kingdom interests and will drunkenly indulge themselves in the things of this world and hypocritically oppose the Kingdom and its servants. In fact, among the signs speaking most loudly of the end of the world and of the invisible presence of Christ in the Kingdom is the visible sign of two opposing servants, a “faithful and wise servant” and “that evil servant”. The existence of these servants and their activities must plainly appear when Satan’s world rule ends and Jehovah’s Kingdom begins. Those servants are visible today, in conjunction with the many other foretold signs. This is strong, indisputable evidence that Satan's rule has been interrupted and the Kingdom has begun.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> According to the King’s own prophecy we should expect and be looking around now to spot the two servants. Why? Because the servants were foretold to take the stage of action after the World War. Every informed person knows that World War I began in A.D. 1914 and ended with a truce in 1918. And when Christ Jesus was asked, “When shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[parousia,</span><span class="font4"> or presence], and of the end of the world?” did he not reply: &quot;Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows”? In that first world conflict whole nations, geared entirely for war, rose up against other nations likewise totally geared. Then food-shortages and rationing and the devastating plagues and destructive earthquakes came and added to the slaughter of war among the noncombatants and neutrals. The sorrows there begun upon Satan's world organization have not ceased even at this date, twenty-nine years later. Certainly the nations were not then fighting for the setting up and advancement of the kingdom of God; the postwar world has had no likeness to the kingdom of God on earth. In fact, all the nations hated and afflicted those who gave their full and undivided devotion to the kingdom of Jehovah God by his Christ.—Matt. 24: 3-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> In order for those who profess to be Christians and Jews to make an intelligent and responsible choice either for the Government of the new world or against it, it is necessary that the good news of the Kingdom be published to inform them what it means. At least they must be put in the way of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">G Why should we now be expecting end looking around to spot the two “servants”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">7 In order for Christians and Jews to make an intelligent and responsible choice respecting the Kingdom, what is necessary, and was such necessary thing predicted? </span><span class="font4">getting such vital information. If they refuse such information, the responsibility for their willful ignorance and opposition is their own. “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Rom. 10: 13-15,17) That the people would not be left in ignorance, but that there would be a mighty publicity campaign to spread the good news that Jehovah’s kingdom was set up in A.D. 1914 and that the old world is on its way out, Christ Jesus expressly predicted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* After detailing the sorrows of world war and the persecution of his faithful disciples Jesus added: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:13,14) And has there not been a tremendous preaching of Jehovah’s Messianic kingdom for a witness to all the nations of the world since A.D. 1914, or more particularly so since the end of World War I in 1918? Yes, there has. And by whom? Not by the religious organizations of “Christendom” and Jewry with their plans of bringing in the Messianic kingdom by world conversion. No; not by them, but by Jehovah’s witnesses, who have persistently called at the homes of the people, year in and year out, to bear witness directly to the people concerning Jehovah’s establishment of the Theocratic Government of his dear Son, Christ Jesus. Such witnesses have been comparatively few, a small minority indeed against a background of millions of Catholics and Protestants and other religionists. Yet their continuous efforts since 1918, in the teeth of mounting opposition and persecution, has resulted, to date, in the placing of more than 400 million copies of books and booklets, in over eighty different languages. Add to this other hundreds of millions of magazines, free tracts and pamphlets distributed, and countless Bible lectures on the public platform, over the radio, and by phonograph recordings and sound cars and boats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’To Jehovah God and Christ Jesus is given the credit for such unheard-of accomplishment. It had to have divine backing, because the divine prophecies had foretold such a Kingdom witness, and the prophecies must never fail, but be fulfilled exactly at the</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">8 What was Christ’s particular prediction on this, and how and through whom has it been fulfilled'’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9 To whom must the credit for such accomplishment be gheo, and why? </span><span class="font4">right time. The prophecies are not yet completely fulfilled; and so the witness work goes on, and will go on, till the final end of the sorrows of the nations comes, at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“FAITHFUL AND WISE SERVANT”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The foregoing facts are unimpeachable and unassailable. They are irremovable signs testifying that Satan's “world&quot; or uninterrupted rule ended in A.D. 1914 by the birth of the kingdom of Jehovah God and of his Christ. After foretelling such now established facts Christ Jesus pointed forward to other impressive signs of the invisible Kingdom and of his coming to the temple for judgment. His coming into the Kingdom power was in A.D. 1914, but the prophecies foretold his coming to the temple thereafter to execute judgment, first toward his professed followers and then toward all the nations of the world. (Mal. 3:1-4; Hag. 2: 6, 7; Zech. 3: 8, 9; Rev. 11:18,19) In his prophecy on the end of the world Jesus was speaking to his consecrated disciples when he warned: &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24:44-51.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> With such phrase the great Prophet was not giving advance notice of the appearing of two individual persons prior to his coming to the temple for judgment of his servants. Christ Jesus is the only individual whom the sacred prophecies have foretold. John the Baptist was only a miniature fulfillment of certain prophecies, besides which he himself served in a prophetic role. Otherwise, the Bible prophecies treat of classes or organizations of individuals. The apostles to whom Jesus directly uttered his prophecy were members of Jehovah’s covenant people, the nation of Israel. They were also the foremost ones of a small remnant of the Israelites who accepted Christ Jesus as the Messiah at his first coming. Says the apostle Paul on this: “Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10 Of what are the foregoing facta signs’ and besides foretelling them, uhat sign of warning did he foretell respecting service<sup>9</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">11 (a&gt; Why was Jesus not foretelling of two individual persons? (b) Who of the Israelites accepted Christ Jesus at bis first advent, and what does this foreshadow? </span><span class="font4">of grace. What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.” (Rom. 11:5,7) This remnant foreshadowed how at the establishment of the Messianic government and the Lord’s coming to the temple there should likewise be merely a remnant that would prove to be his true and faithful disciples. These are Israelites, not after the flesh, but after the spirit. They are Jehovah’s covenant people, not by virtue of the law covenant he made with the natural Israelites through Moses as mediator, but by virtue of the new covenant which Jehovah makes with spiritual Israelites through the Greater Mediator than Moses, Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Those whom the heavenly Father Jehovah accepts and begets by his spirit to become his spiritual children with Christ Jesus constitute his spiritual Israelites, “the Israel of God.” (Gal. 6:15,16) Jehovah God adopts them and makes them members of his royal house of sons of which Christ Jesus is the Head. Why? Because they believe Jehovah's message and make Him their God and accept Christ Jesus as their Ransomer and King. Then they prove their faith by their works. How? By making a consecration of themselves to God through the meritorious sacrifice of Christ Jesus and then seeking to fulfill their consecration by faithfully doing God's will as set forth in his written Word. Before He takes such ones into the covenant with him by sacrifice, Jehovah God makes them acceptable to himself by justifying them through the merit of Christ’s sacrifice. After taking them into the covenant by sacrifice to die a sacrificial death with Christ Jesus, God begets them to a hope of life in the spirit. (1 Pet. 1:3,4,14-23) Such spirit-begotten ones as manifest faithfulness under test, he then anoints with his spirit of power to be his appointed witnesses, preachers of the good news of his kingdom, and joint heirs with Christ Jesus in that kingdom. It is written to them: “Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.”—2 Cor. 1: 21, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” The prophet Isaiah looked down to the end of the world and to the small remnant of spiritual Israel who take their stand, not with the chief men of this world, but for Jehovah’s established kingdom. Then he said: “But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend. Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.” (Isa. 41: 8, 9) Have in mind now that Jesus foretold that all the nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">12. By what course of action and by what divine dealings with them do such ones become spiritual sons of God and his anointed w it D</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">es</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ses ’ 13. What prophecies did Isaiah make concerning God's servant and the identity thereof? </span><span class="font4">would hate the remnant of his consecrated followers, and that false prophets and false Christs would'rise up and make predictions of things to come. In line with this the prophet Isaiah further spoke, to identify those who are truly God’s servant: “All the nations are gathered together, yea, there is an assembling of peoples; who among them can tell this, and things in advance can let us hear? Let them set forth their witnesses that they may get their right, or let them hear and say, Truth! Ye are my witnesses, declareth Jehovah, and my Servant whom I have chosen, ... I have told and will save and make known, that there is among you no strange one; and ye are my witnesses, declareth Jehovah, that I am God. A people which I have fashioned for myself, my praise shall they record.” (Isa. 43:9,10,12,21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> “Do not ye dread, nor yet be alarmed; have I not from olden time told thee and declared? So that ye are my witnesses, whether there is a God besides me? or is no Rock—I know of none! Remember these things, 0 Jacob, and Israel, for my Servant thou art, I have fashioned thee; a Servant of mine thou art.”—Isa. 44:8,21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> In the light of those prophecies which focuses on the time concerning which Jesus prophesied, it is clearly discernible that our Lord’s prophecy of a “faithful and wise servant” was not foretelling some individual man. He was foretelling a class, a people, namely, the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses. Nineteen centuries ago, after only a remnant of the natural Jews denied themselves and took up the stake of reproach to come after Christ Jesus as their Leader and King, Jehovah God turned to the non-Jewish nations to select from them the remaining members of the “body of Christ”. Simeon, whose surname was Peter, was the first apostle whom God sent to such Gentile nations. “Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name.”—Acts 15:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Such taken-out people must serve Jehovah God as witnesses for his name, that is, as Jehovah’s witnesses. Throughout the centuries since then and till now the Lord God has been taking out from the worldly nations this “people for his name”, spiritual Israelites, upon whom the name of Jehovah is called. These, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">as a people,</span><span class="font4"> make up God’s servant, and Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Servant among them and is their Head. For that reason Jesus on earth charged the people whom he healed that “they should not make him known: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14 In such prophetic light what is the ‘‘faithful and wise servant” discerned to be, and of what people is such “servant” a part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15 As what, therefore, must such people serve, and who according to the prophecy of Isaiah is their head? </span><span class="font4">to the Gentiles. And in his name shall the Gentiles trust”.—Matt. 12:14-18, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">preparing the servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The time of Christ’s coming to the temple is a time of judgment, when he makes manifest who is the “faithful and wise servant” and who is “that evil servant”. Malachi’s prophecy, chapter three, announces that before the arrival of this great Messenger at Jehovah’s spiritual temple there should be a preparatory work, that Jehovah’s faithful people might be taken out and might walk in the way that leads to the Kingdom, and in order that the Lord’s Messenger at the temple might be received by a devoted remnant of such “people for his name ”. Authentic history does record such preparatory work, beginning about forty years before the Messenger’s coming.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” About 1878 a small band of consecrated Christians, wholly devoted to Jehovah God and seeking to know his will and to serve him, were meeting together for study of the Scriptures, in search of “meat in due season”, apart from all religious sects. In the following year the Lord God caused the “meat in due season” to begin to be served to the spiritually hungry ones by means of the publication of a magazine, first called “Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence”. In its first issue, as of July, 1879. the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> said respecting its purpose: “As its name indicates, it aims to be the lookout from whence matters of interest and profit may be announced to the ‘little flock,’ and as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'Hei aid of Christ’s Presence,'</span><span class="font4"> to give the ‘meat in due season to the fliousehold of faith.’ . . . We understand that the object of the present witnessing is ‘To take out a people for His name’—the Church—who at Christ’s coming are united to him.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Later (in 1909) the magazine was called “The Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence”. It was the first magazine to publish and prove that Christ’s second coming must be in the spirit, invisible to human eye, and that his coming would be followed by<sup>r</sup> his presence, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font4"> (mistranslated “coming”). The purpose of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font4"> is the gathering of his remnant of faithful followers away from all religious organizations and then the binding of Satan and the destroying of his wicked organization. In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> issue of June, 1SS0, page 6, it published that the end of the “seven times” of the Gentiles would fall in A.D. 1914. (Luke 21: 24) This was indeed “meat in due season”. Feeding thereon, God’s consecrated people for his</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> In 1SS4 it was deemed well to establish a corporation for the wider and more effective spreading of the Bible truths by means of tracts, pamphlets, papers, and other documents. Hence the Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society (now Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society) was chartered at Allegheny, Pennsylvania, according to the Corporation law of that State. This legal, non-profit corporation was merely an instrument for publishing the message and for organizing and forwarding the work of those fully dedicated to Jehovah's service. Here, then, was a company, group or body of Christians, a “people for his name’’, wholly detached from all religious systems and unreservedly consecrated and separated to the Lord God, and seeking solely to do his will as revealed in his Holy Word. As such they constituted a servant body of the Lord, wholly subject to his will and commandments. They were looking for their Head and Master to finish the earthly work with his church and to take them unto himself in the heavenly realm. They did not know for a certainty the date or day or hour of their Lord’s coming to the temple for judgment; but they expected marvelous things to occur at the end of the Times of the Gentiles, in 1914. Were such ones prepared as the “faithful and wise servant” class in the years of preparing the way before Christ’s coming to the temple? How shall we determine this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Christ Jesus said: “Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.” (Matt. 7: 16,17) The Lord provides the fruit for his fruit-bearers. It is good fruit, being found in his written Word as He makes it understandable. The Lord’s “servant” must hold forth and carry forth those fruits to others who hunger for truth and righteousness. Alongside that note again Jesus’ words: &quot;Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?” (Matt. 24:45) Jehovah God does not have several such; he has only one &quot;faithful and -wise servant”, and that “servant” company he makes ruler over his household as to the dispensing of the spiritual food and the conducting of the work of the household members. Jehovah God does not have several organizations, each conflicting with the others and each seeking to be rulers over the whole household or to divide up the rulership and exercise control over a division of the household. “Is Christ divided?” No! “For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">19 (a) What was organized in 1884. and for what purpose’ (b) What distinctive body of Christians was thus in evidence on earth, and for what were they looking forward’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">20 By what fruit-bearing quahti must the identity of the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; be determined, and why should we not search for several buchiike servants? </span><span class="font4">the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.”—1 Cor. 1: 13; 12:12; 14: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The great God and Father of the household of faith has only one visible organization which he uses as his “servant” channel to convey “meat in due season”. That channel is not religious, forasmuch as religion is not “meat in due season” but consists of the traditional teachings and practices of demonized men which make of no effect God’s Word and commandments. Moreover, “organized religion&quot; is divided and at odds with itself and leads to confusion respecting faith in Jehovah God and his kingdom; it blasphemes and heaps reproach upon his name. Hence it cannot be the “people for his name&quot;; it cannot be the “servant” whom the Most High God has formed to show forth His praise. Religion, and all the conflicting systems thereof, are a part of this world and friendly to it and serve the interests of this world which they are trying to convert and dominate. Such conduct is spiritual adultery: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4: 4) Judged by its fruits and the present-day results of the people’s eating thereof, “organized religion” could not be that &quot;faithful and wise servant” whom God has made ruler over his household to spread life-sustaining “meat in due season” before them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The real “servant” company or society must be clean from this world and its religion. The “servant” must be entirely devoted to Jehovah’s service, being composed of creatures consecrated to him, exercising full faith in his Word, and serving to others the revealed truths of the Bible to build them up in the “most holy faith”. The “servant” must be composed of those who are begotten of God’s spirit to a heavenly inheritance and who seek first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness. They must advertise it as the only hope of mankind, and thereby build up good-will toward that righteous Government of God by Christ Jesus. Hence the “servant’s” history becomes open for all to consult. To what conclusion does it lead!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The physical facts since A.D. 1878 down to 1918 prove that the small body of consecrated, spirit-begotten men and women who were and are unitedly serving Jehovah God and his Kingdom in conjunction with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society match the prophetic description of the “servant”. Therefore such ones, though bodily spread through-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">21. How many visible organizations does Jehovah use as his “servant ’ channel? and why could this not include &quot;organized religion&quot;’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">22. What, therefore, must be the position of the real “servant&quot; company respecting thia world and religion and Jehovah God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">23. Whom do the physical tacts prove to match the “servant's&quot; description, and In what sense is the “servant&quot; wise and faithful? </span><span class="font4">out the earth, yet unitedly co-operating by means of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, are the Lord’s “servant” body on earth. That “servant” is wise, because fearing Jehovah God and not demons or men: “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 9:10; 29:25) That “servant” is faithful, because showing faith in God’s Word, holding true to him, proving reliable and obedient in his service, and keeping covenant with him in unbroken integrity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> “Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” (Matt. 24: 46, 47) Such prophecy makes certain that Jehovah’s “servant” class would prove faithful down till the Lord’s coming to the temple in A.D. 1918. At that momentous date, as is well known, the remnant of Jehovah’s “people for his name” were colaboring with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as their legal governing body. Also they were the only ones who in the face of world war and the hatred of all nations were persisting in proclaiming Jehovah’s kingdom and announcing its establishment in A.D. 1914. Christ Jesus declared that the “servant” found to be faithful and wise and actively in service at the time of his coming to the temple for judgment would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">blessed.</span><span class="font4"> So the Lord would entrust him with “all his goods”, that is, all his visible Kingdom interests on earth. Certainly, then, that “servant” would be the one whom the King Christ Jesus would use to fulfill his prophecy falling due after the World War I: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” Such gospel of God’s kingdom as born in 1914 has been preached with unparalleled publicity in all the world to all nations since 1918, so much so that all nations of “Christendom” and all religious organizations have risen up in opposition to the Kingdom witness. Actual accomplishment of such testimony to the Kingdom under persecution points unmistakably to the one whom the Lord has chosen as his “servant”, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, by whom the worldwide witness has been and continues to be given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> This is factual proof that Christ Jesus has approved and laid his hands upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses as his visible representatives and that he has united them with himself at the temple. Thus since 1918 they constitute with him and under him the “faithful and wise servant” class. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Ruler over all the Kingdom “goods” or interests, and the Ruler has en-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">24 (a) What do Jesus* words show as to the course of “that servant” down till his coming in 1918* (b) How would that servant be blessed, and to whom does active participation in such blessedness positively point? 25 According to facts, upon whom did the Lord lay hands at his coming, uhat do they constitute since then, and what is their prime responsibility? </span><span class="font4">trusted those interests on earth to the faithful and wise remnant. Their prime responsibility, therefore, is to 'preach this gospel of the kingdom’ to the meek and to bear forth the “meat in due season” which the King supplies to them. This they must supply to the Lord’s “other sheep”, the persons of goodwill scattered abroad throughout all the earth and who must be gathered and fed and brought into the Good Shepherd’s fold before the battle of Armageddon is unleashed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>‘ To such end Jehovah God has by Christ Jesus anointed the “faithful and wise servant” class with his spirit, in fulfillment of his prophecy relating to the end of the world: “And it shall come to pass afterward [in the last days, saith God], that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.’’ (Joel 2:28,29; Acts 2:16-18) This outpouring of the spirit of anointing upon the remnant in the flesh, the “faithful and wise servant” class, has specially been manifest since A.D. 1922, when the witness work of advertising Jehovah’s King and kingdom took on increased vitality, activity and efficiency. The Kingdom’s greatest testimony since the time of the first Jehovah’s witness, Abel, has followed from and after 1922. The religionists have looked on in amazement at Jehovah’s witnesses and their intense efforts and unswerving faithfulness to the Kingdom interests and have wondered what it is all about. It is a sign of the Kingdom’s entry into power. Jehovah’s active witnesses are for a visible sign thereof, and all the religionists who brand it man’s work and who fight against it and try to efface the sign are unable to overthrow it. They prove themselves to be fighting against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> This sign was foretold by an ancient witness of Jehovah, saying: “Lo, I, and the children whom Jehovah hath given to me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of Hosts, who is dwelling in Mount Zion.” (Isa. 8:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young,</span><span class="font4"> Heb. 2:13,14) Speaking concerning Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s High Priest and Branch at the temple, another prophet declared: “Hear now, 0 Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at [marginal reading: they are men of sign]; for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, The BRANCH.” (Zech. 3:8) The religionists of “Christendom” despise the sign and refuse to believe it, and rebel against acknowledging the society of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses as his</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">26. What prophecy concerning divine commission has God therefore fulfilled to them, since when has it been particularly manifest, and of what is this a sign?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">27. How was this sign foretold by the prophets Isaiah and Zechariah* </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">■ n</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">d why will Jehovah vindicate his faithful “senant&quot; class?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘faithful and wise servant”. Hence they persecute and interfere with Jehovah’s “servant” class and call them false prophets. However, these are the only ones equipped with Jehovah’s “meat in due season” and anointed of him to preach it; and the day is near at hand when Jehovah God will vindicate his faithful “servant” class. “And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.”—Ezek. 33: 27-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THAT EVIL SERVANT”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Christ Jesus is primarily Jehovah’s ‘Elect Servant’ and is the Head, Leader and Commander of the &quot;faithful and wise servant” class. (Isa. 42:1; 55: 4) At the time that Jesus on earth rode into Jerusalem and then came to the temple and cleansed it of the religious merchandisers, he had among his apostles an unfaithful, traitorous fellow servant. Just before Jesus came to the temple Judas Iscariot objected to the loving attention paid to Jesus and took offense at it, but in a hypocritical way, saying: ‘Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?” “This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.” The next day Jesus rode into Jerusalem and cleansed the temple. (John 12:1-16) Jesus called Judas a “devil” (slanderer), not clean, “the son of perdition,” and lost. (John 6: 70, 71; 13: 10,11, 18; 17: 12) Certainly Christ Jesus did not die as a ransom for Judas and his like!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Judas had been entrusted with Kingdom interests, having been commissioned to preach the Kingdom message and to perform miracles of healing. As one of the twelve disciples closest to Jesus he held an intimate and confidential relationship to Jehovah's ‘Elect Servant’. Judas, however, was unfaithful to his trust, was greedy for money that was contributed to the Kingdom service, misused the confidential information that he had of Christ Jesus and his apostles, and sought gain from the enemy to the damage of the visible organization of Jehovah’s people. He hid his traitorous heart and purpose from the unsuspecting apostles down to the end. He brazenly dared to kiss Jesus and greet him with a ‘‘Hail, Master!” while in the very act of betraying him and bringing him into the courts of law of the land, namely, the Supreme Court, or Sanhedrin, Governor Pilate’s and King Herod’s court. (Matt. 26:14-16,47-50, 57-68; Luke 23:1-25) Judas Iscariot is therefore the prototype of “that evil servant” whom Jesus foretold. Who is such “evil servant” in this day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2S. Who Is the head of the faithful '‘servant” class<sup>1</sup> and how did rudas Iscariot conduct and express himself when Jesus came to the •emple at Jerusalem?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">29 How did Judas manifest himself as a traitor and unfaithful servant, ind of whom therefore is be a prototype?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*° “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming: and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken.&quot; (Matt. 24: 48, 49) The expression “But and if that evil servant” does not mean that the “faithful and wise servant” gets careless, arrogant, self-indulgent, and becomes unwise, unfaithful and evil. It does not mean that the remnant society of Jehovah’s witnesses abuse the Lord’s service, pervert it, renounce it and become lawless, oppressive and unfaithful to their trust. The facts today in evidence do not support such a wresting of our Lord’s prophetic words. Contrariwise, Christ Jesus assures us that, having found the servant to be faithful and wise at His coming, he advances him and makes him His visible representative on earth and ruler over all his “goods”, or Kingdom interests. The unequaled accomplishment since 1918 of Jehovah’s witnesses, through the instrumentality of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” proves the Lord has accounted them “faithful and wise” and has retained them in his service and has entrusted them with his royal goods, or Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The “faithful and wise servant” is not an individual man on earth. Likewise “that evil servant” is not any individual person, but represents a class of persons taking a common course of evil action and sharing a like destiny. “That evil servant” means a class of men and women once </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">servants</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah God and associated with his visible organization. They once devoted themselves to God in consecration and were begotten of his spirit and taken into his household as spiritual sons and were for a time apparently faithful. But they do not endure to the end in God’s service, and turn evil. At the time that the Lord begins judgment at the temple their evil conduct is exposed. So they manifest themselves from and after 1918.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Their trouble begins with the heart, the seat of affection and motivation. (Prov. 4: 23) In the heart this class says: “My lord delayeth his coming.” True, this class may claim to believe in Christ’s invisible presence and that his presence, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parousia,</span><span class="font4"> began at 1874 according to their understanding of chronology. But in their heart, and by their actions which are motivated by their heart condition, they deny the Lord’s coming and presence. Why so? Because his coming and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font4"> means the time when he gathers his faithful body-members yet on earth into a unity with him at the temple, making out of them one indivisible service organization. It is the time when the Lord Jesus puts into practice</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">30. What have the words “But and if that evil servant” been wrested to mean, but wbat do the facts prove as to Jehovah's witnesses<sup>1</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">31. Whom, then, does “that evil servant” mean, and when Is that manifest ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">32. Wbat proves, and bow. that the “evil servant” class say In their hearts, ”My lord delayeth bls coming”? </span><span class="font4">the Theocratic rule and procedure within that organization, establishing over it a unified command and ruling it from the top down and not at the dictation of personal preferences from the bottom up. The “evil servant” class would adhere to such organization and unified command and Theocratic governance and would submit thereto if they in their hearts believed in the Lord’s having come and being present. They would agree that such Theocratic arrangement and such joyful and willing submission are due from them as befitting the time and occasion of his presence. But their selfish-hearted action and their desire to ‘do every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes’ prove that they do not believe that the Theocratic King has come to the temple for judgment. In their secret heart intents they say: “My lord delayeth his coming&quot;; I can follow my own inclination and get by with it.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The “evil servant” class do not see the Lord’s organization, that it is one and is Theocratic in arrangement and operation, and that Jehovah God ‘hath set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him'. They are heady, headstrong, seeking headship for themselves. They do not appreciate that their fellows in the organization are not under their charge and dictation but are the Lord’s servants. They criticize and judge the Lord’s servants as if such ones were their own, and they “speak evil of dignities”, those whom the Lord God has dignified by placing them in a responsible position in the organized body of Christ. They become meddlers, busybodies in other men's matters, and are ambitious to be independent and higher in position than where the Lord has placed them. They speak evil of the Lord's setup which they do not understand. (See Matthew 25:24-26; 1 Corinthians 4:1-3; Romans 14: 4: Jude S-16.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Then this unfaithful group speak evil of their fellow servants by hurling false, malicious charges against their brethren who are discharging their duties as unto the Lord. Thereby they ’smite their fellow servants', and cause suspicions, evil sur-misings, disturbance, disruption and divisions within the organization. They proceed lawlessly as respects the Theocratic law, and do not follow the Lord’s rule stated at 1 Corinthians 6:1,2: “Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints! Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world! and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters!” They prefer the company of the “drunken”.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">33 What proves that the “evil servant&quot; class do not see the Lord’s organization and its structure*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">34 Hou does this class ‘smite their fellow servants' and act lawlesUv* 35 Hou does the ‘‘evil servant’ “eat and drink with the drunken&quot;? and when did such a class begin to show themselves as pursuing that course? </span><span class="font4">in the darkness of its night, careless and indifferent toward the Lord’s coming. Accordingly they fill themselves full with the selfish things of this world, not caring about feeding and watering the Lord's “other sheep”. The “evil servant” class neither keep up with the “meat in due season” which the Lord provides nor do they seek to pass such spiritual food on to others, their brethren and the Lord's “other sheep”. They view themselves as the spiritual class, beside whom the others must wait as to God's favors and spiritual food. So they “feed themselves&quot;, ‘eating and drinking’ for selfish desires after the manner of the “drunken” world, particularly the clergy or ecclesiastical element thereof. Shortly before the Lord’s coming to the temple in 191S such a class associated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society began to manifest themselves and to pursue such a course toward Jehovah God, his Christ and their brethren. They did not expect the Lord's arrival at the temple in the spring of 1918.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> “The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 24:50,51) It is the Lord that by his angels puts the “evil servant” out of his organization; and the Lord Jesus at the temple so did from and after 1918. (Matt. 13:41,42) In the temple judgment he does not approve of their lawless, self-willed course nor commit to them &quot;his goods”, but cuts that wicked servant class asunder from his visible organization. Jehovah God did therefore not pour out upon them his spirit and anoint them with the “unction from the Holy One”. That class is not and never was an anointed class. In demonstration of these facts such ones separated themselves from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and set up independent organizations of their own, subject to their own control and not Theocratic rule. “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction from the Holv One, and ye know all things.” —1 John 2: 19,20.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> “That evil servant” class may still study the Bible and publish religious documents with Bible quotations, and may still call Christ Jesus “Lord, Lord!” But the King at the temple is not deceived by such flattery and smooth professions of loyalty. Like Judge Jephthah of old, he notes the difference between their message and his Theocratic “meat in</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">36 . Who puts that class out of the organization, and bow. and what action do they take therefore with respect to the organization?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">37 Why do their continued study of the Bible and publication of religious documents not pro\e they are still serving Jehovah God and gathering *itb CUrut Jesus? </span><span class="font4">due season”; he observes that, like the rebellious Ephraimites of old, they are unable to publish and declare the Theocratic test-word “Shibboleth”, but are pretenders, hypocrites. (Judg. 12:1-6) He is fully aware that they do not do his will by working peacefully and unitedly with his approved “faithful and wise servant” and in obedience to Theocratic rule. Since they do not “gather” with him and his “servant”, they are scattering; since they are not with him, they are against him. They declare to the world the most intimate and confidential matters of the Lord’s organization which they learned while associated with it. Thus they make it public property for the use and advantage of the enemy. In not holding with the Lord’s &quot;faithful and wise servant” organization, but criticizing, condemning and working against it, they line up with the worldly nations and religionists who fight against Jehovah's kingdom and His witnesses.—Matt. 12:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> As to that “evil servant”, the Judge at the temple does not hesitate to “appoint him his portion with the hypocrites”, and bids that class to depart from him as &quot;workers of iniquity’. He classes them with the religious hypocrites. (Matt. 7:22-24) Inasmuch as they were foreshadowed by Judas and by his prototype, Ahithophel, King David’s traitorous counselor who at last hung himself, the “evil servant” class form part of the apostate &quot;man of sin”, &quot;the son of perdition.” In fact, having once been associated with Jehovah's organized people and enjoyed a confidential relationship with it and then having rebelled and proved untrue, they are the most reprehensible part of the “man of sin” class, seeing that they held a more responsible position as spirit-begotten servants of God than the religious clergy ever held. The expression &quot;son of perdition” points to their final end, destruction.—2 Sain. 15:30-37; 16:23; 17:1-23; 2 Thess. 2:3-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Before descending into such perdition or destruction, that class give way to &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth” for the rest of their life. They gnash with their teeth at the &quot;faithful and wise servant” class and express no sympathy with them in the world-wide persecution these undergo. They publicly declare they have never been Jehovah's witnesses, and openly charge that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a Christian organization. They “weep”, not in repentance or remorse, but because of taking offense at the conduct of the faithful and because of being unable to put across their selfish aims and purposes against the faithful, and because of imagined injustices which they claim the Lord’s faithful have committed against them. They profess to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3S With whom does the Lord class them, by whom were they foreshadowed. and of what larger group do they form the most reprehensible part<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">30. Why does the “evil sen ant” cla^s give way to ‘‘weeping”, and why and against whom do they 'gnash their teeth’? </span><span class="font4">be “children of the kingdom”; and doubtless when, Shortly, Almighty God resurrects from the dead the faithful prophets and witnesses of the days before Christ and makes such the visible princely representatives of the kingdom of heaven, the “evil servant” class will weep and grind their teeth. Jesus contrasted them with his “other sheep”, saying: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. S: 11,12) After seeing this, they will go down into perdition at the battle of Armageddon. The “other sheep”, whom they refused to hunt up and serve with the “meat in due season”, will survive that great tribulation and will sit with the Kingdom's princes and partake of the Kingdom’s blessings.—Luke 13: 25-30.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> Other scriptures make it very clear that the “evil servant” class would prominently display itself in the “time of the end”, and the more so the nearer we get to the final end of all of Satan's crowd. Satan’s chief spirit prince, Gog, will specially use the peculiarly informed “evil servant” class in the conspiracy with all his other worldly elements against Jehovah’s faithful remnant and their companions, the “other sheep”. (Ezek. 38:3-23) Thus the &quot;evil servant” class will more openly betray their evil co-operation with all other elements of Satan's organization, religious, political and commercial, and unmistakably show they are one with these, “eating and drinking” with them as a part of this world. The sign of the two “servants” must therefore become sharper and more pronounced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> The “faithful and wise servant” is a visible symbol of Christ's side of the great issue, the side in favor of Jehovah's universal domination over all living creatures. “That evil servant” is a visible symbol of the opposing side in this primary issue. Both “servants” are now active, each in behalf of his respective side of the issue. The hour of decision is here. The choice must be either to become companions with the “faithful and wise servant” and loyally serve Jehovah and his Kingdom with his “servant”, or to join the “evil servant” class and ‘weep and gnash the teeth’ against God’s visible organization and at the last suffer fiery destruction, perdition. For the admonition of those who seek to worship God in spirit and in truth Jehovah God prophetically contrasts the two opposing “servant” classes and their destinies now, at Isaiah 65: 13-16. Read that prophecy, and then heed with wisdom the Kingdom sign thus given.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GILEAD GRADUATES FIRST CLASS OF STUDENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">F</span><span class="font3">EBRUARY 15 of this year </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> made the stirring announcement of the opening of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, This came as a pleasant surprise to persons of good-will all over the world. “Gilead,” the beautiful building erected on Kingdom Farm of 701 acres at South Lansing, New York, in 1940, was to house this New World undertaking and to become the home for the preparing of Theocratic ministers who will, by the Lord's grace, pile up in all parts of the earth a heap of witness to The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Monday, February 1, the college was dedicated in an impressive service by the president and some directors of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the very opening of the classes immediately thereafter, the student body of one hundred men and women, all ordained ministers, put their hearts and souls into their studies. Within a few days the students and faculty had completely adjusted themselves to their new schedule of life in the Watchtower Bible College, which from the start operated as any long-established institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The college founders had arrangements made for the housing and feeding, as well as for the educational training. The household of Gilead was organized to operate identically as the Bethel home of the Watchtower Society, in Brooklyn. Bethel household instructions and routine, having been well consummated over a period of fifty years’ experience in New York, aided greatly in settling the students as to their daily life, association and work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The college day, Monday to Friday, began at 8 a.m., after which followed five periods of instruction in the morning, of 40 minutes each, with 10-minute intermissions, and two similar periods in the early afternoon. These periods of instruction included classroom recitations and lecture periods. From 3 to 6 p.m. each day all the students were assigned duties of assisting in the operation of the household and the farm. The sisters work in the laundry, kitchen, sewing room, dormitory housecleaning, and garden work. The brothers work on the land, in the machine shop, construction, and in the woods All such extracurricular activity was found to be a great blessing to the students. It enabled them to relax their minds from study and at the same time to gain practical knowledge, experience and exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After but the first month of college, these are some of the remarks made by the students: “What I have learned this past month I count priceless.” “The quality of schooling here is beyond expectation.” “I find myself a bit more rusty than I expected.” “Spanish and English are my hardest subjects.” “I realize it is the Lordls will for me to dig hard while I am privileged to stay here.” “Concentration is my biggest battle.” “We thought we knew the Bible, but now realize how little we really knew.” “I count this the greatest privilege ever extended to me in my long years of pioneer service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The college term of five months having been divided into two semesters of ten weeks each, the directors of the Watchtower Society thought it well to schedule examinations in each course at the close of each semester. Following the first semester’s examinations of April 10, it was found that six of the students were unable to continue their studies. The remaining ninety-four qualified to complete the college term The Society set high scholastic standards, and even though some students might pass in the various courses, yet such would not qualify them to receive a diploma. Only those passing with merit so qualify. At the close of the second semester final examinations were held, to fully ascertain the extent of knowledge all had received during the entire period of twenty weeks’ study. Every student realized the import of these final examinations and made extensive review of all the subjects. The preparations for examinations were taken so seriously and earnestly that for days prior thereto students were busy studying until late at night and some thought it necessary to rise at four o’clock in the morning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June 18 the long-looked-for closing examinations began, and covered four days. We are pleased to report that al) the ninety-four students passed in their courses, and, of these, eighty-four passed with merit, thus qualifying them to receive diplomas. In these final examinations the brethren demonstrated that they really knew what they had been taught during the past five months. When one considers the vast amount of material covered in the brief period of the college term, material which embraced in its scope an exhaustive study of the entire Bible, a searching study of all leading doctrines taught in the Scriptures, a practical working knowledge of law and international relations, some necessary history, a thorough study of Bible speaking, a comprehensive study of Theocratic organization instructions and practical field ministry, a study of college English, mathematics, and a speaking and reading knowledge of Spanish, surely only those wholly devoted to The Theocracy could have accomplished the consolidation of this wide range of knowledge. In secular schools this would have comprised a two-year curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Applied missionary service, on which a grading was given, included the actual application in the field of the knowledge and training received in the school. In addition to their heavy studies and farm and household duties, the students averaged more than twenty-five hours of actual field service each month. All the territory within a radius of thirty miles of Gilead was effectively reached and served with the Kingdom message. Every phase of the work was participated in, such as back-calls, model Bible studies, magazine street work and house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wednesday, June 23, marked a historic event, the first graduation at the New World college. Promptly at 8:30 a.m. the exercises began, being opened by an appropriate prayer to Jehovah God. The college president served as chairman of this assembly, to which not only the students had been invited but also all members of the Kingdom Farm family. Approximately 160 were in attendance in the beautiful auditorium of “Gilead”. The first speaker to be introduced by the chairman was W. E. Van Amburgh, the aged secretary-treasurer of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. He rendered some wise and able counsel for the edification of the students. Then followed a brief talk by the Kingdom Farm servant, who expressed his appreciation for the splendid co-operation given by all the students, both in work and in their domestic association and life at Gilead. Then each of the instructors spoke a few words of farewell and blessing upon the graduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The principal and eagerly awaited part of the graduation-day program was the address by the president of the college, N. II. Knorr, also president of the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. Brother Knorr made a stirring appeal on •“Work, Patience and Faith”. His opening words were: “Jehovah is the Great Workman of all time.” In beautiful phrase he described the glorious work and successful carrying out of the purpose of Jehovah and the privilege of each one in a covenant with Him to colabor with him. These remarks served as an introductory to the general body of the talk, “The Future of College Graduates,” which is published hereinafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the conclusion of the lecture a large case containing the diplomas was opened and put on the podium table. One by one the names of all the students were called by the president to come forward to receive their diplomas. Inside each diploma, which itself is a folded document in a beautiful leather case, was presented a copy of the class picture, and their college report card. Then, amidst mingled feelings of joy and of tenderness at leaving the beloved college, the students spontaneously offered the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STATEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The entire student body desires to make the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We, the first graduating class of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, do hereby express our deep appreciation to Jehovah and His Theocratic organization, the Watchtower Society, and its president, and to the college faculty, for the marvelous privilege of receiving additional Theocratic instruction and training, enabling us to become more efficient ambassadors of The Theocracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also appreciate the many loving provisions made for our comfort, and for the fellowship and assistance rendered by the Kingdom Farm family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We do hereby reiterate our determination to be faithful to the sacred commission entrusted to us by our heavenly Father, Jehovah, and by His grace we will serve Him faithfully in whatever territory He may direct, announcing the New World and feeding the “other sheep”, who will form the “great multitude”, with “food convenient”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We go forth ever mindful that it is only by the grace and in the strength of the Lord, and by a continual fight against the demons, that we will prove ourselves, to His glory, “more than conquerors through him that loved us.”—Romans 8.37</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Made and adopted this 23d day of June, 1943, on the first graduation day of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead )</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to graduation day the president had assigned to each student his ultimate place of service in one of nine Latin-American countries. Assignments were also made to a number of them of temporary service as special publishers in various parts of the United States, pending final arrangements for their travel abroad. Students were permitted to choose partners and to form groups of four to twelve for such future Theocratic activity abroad. The abundant provisions made by the Society and revealed to them on graduation day was almost overwhelming Every heart was overflowing. Graduates, faculty and guests were all deeply touched. It was a day’ and an event never to be forgotten</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a concluding observation it must be recorded what an exemplary spirit prevailed among the students, faculty and farm brethren at all times. The students matured greatly m knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Their love and devotion to the Lord became more manifest. Even their physical health improved during their course at Gilead From the very beginning the students were continually given a vision of their future work abroad and were being built up to that end, by the Lord's grace. The graduates were anxious to receive their new assignments and to discharge their increased responsibilities to Jehovah God and his kingdom The prayers and best wishes of all of Jehovah’s people throughout the earth go with them. After a summer recess the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead will open its doois to a new group of students.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE FUTURE OF COLLEGE GRADUATES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">[The speech delivered by the president of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead at its first graduation exercises, June 23, 1943]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">C</span><span class="font2">REATURES in God’s organization should be very anxious to do the things committed into their care properly, especially so the graduates of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead. Knowing that God has in the earth a “faithful and wise servant” organization with which we are associated and co-operating, we should be anxious to perform the work entrusted to our charge with diligence, with exactness and with the greatest of care. We do not wish to do things in our own strength, for we know we cannot do so; but we are solicitous to bring about the best results in the interests of the Kingdom, for such results will honor the Lord’s name and word. We are earnestly desirous at all times to do bigger things, greater things in the interests of his Righteous Government, if that is at all possible; not for the glory of any man, nor for the advancement of any human organization. Only because we are interested in the New World and the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the full proclamation of the Kingdom do we want to advance these Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knowing Jehovah’s purposes, we appreciate that the Kingdom interests are committed into the hands of his people and that these interests must be increased by his servants. Properly, therefore, we try to do that, in a manner pleasing to the Lord, and in any capacity we hold. If we are a publisher in a companv of Jehovah’s witnesses, we try to arrange our affairs whereby we can become a pioneer or full-time publisher If we are in the pioneer section, we try to improve our abilities and time in the work with the prospect of becoming a special publisher If we are a special publisher, we might eventually qualify to be a traveling servant to the brethren; or, if we are such a seivant we may, because of our efficient work and our desire to honor the Lord’s name and increase the interests of his kingdom, be charged with responsibilities in foreign countries. Being faithful in our present position often brings greater privileges with greater responsibility. Sueh privileges and responsibilities should never be shunned or rejected. We should thank the Lord for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regardless of any advancement or not, we do our work because it is the Lord’s will and is right. We know that we have the truth. We know that we are working with God’s organization We know that Satan’s devilish organization is to go down and be cleared out, and that for a certainty God’s kingdom in all its power and glory will bring unspeakable blessings to this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have his sure word of prophecy that a great witness must be given in all the earth for a witness to that effect; and that the people of good-will must be comforted; and that there is another flock of sheep, larger than the “little flock”, which must all be brought into one fold The gathering together of these “other sheep” into the organization of the Lord is in itself a great work, not a work that will bring honor to men or to individuals, but one that brings honor and glory to our heavenly Father</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the Scriptures we know that we have taken the right course. We have studied God’s Word and have been blessed by it. Because we are positive of having adopted the right course, we have set aside every earthly desire of selfishness. We are not conceined for the comforts of home, or a family, or the establishment of a great commercial business displaying prominently our name; but we have sought to follow the path in life which is despised of all selfish men. It is a simple and strange course in the eyes of creatures; to them it does not amount to much. Why ? Because we do not leave a great name for future generations. Theie is no profit-making business left behind to pass on to our children, if any. There is no great wealth to bestow upon others. Yet, as far as work is concerned, you are woiking as bard as others, putting in as much time, but, as measured in this world’s goods, you are gaining nothing You are not a simpleton, though; because in the world to come you will gain everlasting life. The men of this old world, and their women and children, are stoung up riches on this earth, trying to have a place of security insured to them. But do they really succeed’ They can never be secure against the destruction unavoidably due to come upon the whole world. However, those who have entered into a covenant with God are storing up riches in heaven, which will not ru<sub>a</sub>t or be destroyed They have value with Jehovah God, who is in heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So. then, the work that you Bible college graduates do in going from door to door or on the street corners proclaiming the Kingdom message, and conducting book studies and model Bible studies; your woik of going into small towns where witnesses have never gone before, or your planning to go to other countries where the message has never been given; all of this is a vital vvork preliminary to the establishment of the New World of righteousness It is a work that Jehovah God ordained should be done now, and it must be done without fail. If it is not done by creatures who are commu sioned to do it, then the very stones will cry out the Lord’s message But this does not become necessary Those who make up the spiritual “little flock” and the earthly “other sheep’’, the companions associated with them, have accepted from Jehovah God the responsibility and great privilege of seeing that this message is proclaimed in ail the earth to the honor and glory of the Lord God Jehovah God has made ample provision for the training and proper instruction of his people and has seen to it that they are fed with the “food convenient”. In this he has never failed We are certain that God’s work will be accomplished, whether he does it through heavenly creatures or by earthly creatures. The work of the proclamation of the Kingdom which he has ordained shall be faithfully done by his devoted servants on the earth. Because of their faithfulness they will receive the great reward of everlasting life, some in the heavenly Kingdom, and some upon the earth where they will have the glorious privilege of bringing forth a righteous offspring under the King Christ Jesus in fulfillment of the divine mandate, unto how many generations we do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before these can receive such wonderful blessings of life to serve their God throughout eternity to come in a manner pleasing to him and fully in accord with his will, they prove certain things now. They must demonstrate their absolute devotion to him, and must hold fast their integrity toward him. This must be done under trying conditions. They can prove their integrity and devotion to the Lord only by their works. At Philippians 2 12. 13. it is written: “Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” These words of Christ’s apostle are especially nppiicab’e today. You of this student body now graduating have obeyed your Father in heaven long before you came here, by faithful service in the pioneer activity. For the past twenty weeks of association with the Society while you have been present here at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead you have been faithful students and witnesses and have done well. But, as the apostle puts the rule, though you have obeyed the Lord at this college and under direct supervision of its faculty, it is still necessaiy to work out your salvation with fear and trembling Never should you lose sight of your individual relationship to Jehovah God and his organization, whether you be working in groups, in large companies, or m isolated parts. It is necessary alwavs to be conscious that we are colaboring with the great organization of God which he has established in the earth at tins time, in this “the day of Jehovah”; and that it is he who “worketli in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You are anxious to do the Lord’s will. Y’ou have searched out that will by a study of his Word. Here at this college you have been studying his Word intensely during the past five months You knew much of Jehovah’s will before you came heie Todav you should have a much better appreciation of his will concerning you, as to how you can do his good pleasure in the future with greater efficiency You appreciate the advantage of study and of increasing your knowledge. This, I feel sure, you will never cease from doing, that is, studying and adding to your knowledge of the Lord’s Word. This is essential to your spiritual health and salvation. It is essential to your work by which you prove your integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The God whom we serve is not unmindful of the woik and labor of love that you have performed both here and out in the field in times past. But he does admonish us through his apostle, at Hebrews chapter six, that while he is not unmindful of the past good accomplishments of his servants in the interest of the Kingdom, still they must continue on in their activity to the very end, and not slack the hand or be slothful It is only through faith and patience (or endurance) that we shall realize the promises set forth m his Word concerning us The sixth chapter of Hcbiews, at verses ten to twelve, says: “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the Society selected you from among the Lord’s ordained ministers, full-time workers in the field of Kingdom activity, inviting you to come here as students, it was because the Lord was not unmindful of your labor of love and the works that you had shown toward your brethren, and how you bad ministered to the sanctified ones and the people of good-will And, now that you have finished a strenuous course of study in the Watchtower Bible College, it is the Society’s desire that every one of you show the same diligence in the future, to the full assurance of hope unto the end. We discern that the kingdom of God is established in the new heavens, and that even before the “better resurrection” of the faithful men of old to become “princes in all the earth” we today are privileged to be the active visible representatives of the established Kingdom. Yet it is our hope that we may have the privilege of living through the approaching battle of Armageddon wherein all opposition to the Kingdom will be destroyed and its earthly princes be installed in office. We shall never attain to that hope if we become slothful or negligent. Rather we should, as admonished by the apostle, follow through with the same faith and patient endurance as those faithful men of old who have gone before us, such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Jephthah, even all the faithful ones of old mentioned in Hebrews chapter eleven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is absolutely necessary that we show forth the same faith as Abraham when he left his own people and went into a foreign country. (Heb. 12:1) There he actually became heir to a promise that “in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed”. This did not come to pass in the person of his own seed, Isaac; nevertheless, Abraham had faith that sometime in the future a seed would be brought forth that would bring about the Kingdom, or Theocratic Government, under which Abraham desired to live. It did not matter that it did not happen in his day. Many others have had this same faith and patience, and they never slacked their hand, no matter what the Lord asked them to do through his mouthpieces or angels. Those men of old did not realize the promises at that time, but they received full assurance from their great God in heaven that they were faithful and approved, because they gave evidence of their faith by their obedient works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO MAKE GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But now, what about you today graduating from this college and who have earned on faithfully to the present time! Due to being where we are on the stream of time there is a possibility and a very good likelihood that all of you, continuing faithful, true and steadfast toward the Lord, will see his promise fulfilled toward those faithful men of old and will yourselves personally realize the promise given to all those who have entered into a covenant with God. Sueh will be accomplished only through your fa.th and patience in the work you still have to do As you leave this college and go into other assigned fields and begin work in this land now, and then, later, as the Lord opens the way, move on to other lands, it will require great enduiance. But you have the precious promises from Jehovah God that he will sustain you in your trials and hardships Your faith will at times be tried to the utmost. but then think of Moses when going before Pharaoh and then walking out of Egypt and through the Red sea and then living in the wilderness Moses never turned aside Think of Joshua crossing through the Jordan river into the Promised Land; he had a real fight on his hands there. Have faith like theiis. The promises concerning the Kingdom and the blessings that come to the faithful remained sure and positive, although not all fulfilled in their day, and Jehovah carried out those pui poses m his own due time. “Ye have ‘'eard of the patience of Job Jas. 5: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostle James stated (1.3-5) • “Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraidcth not, and it shall be given him ” The road ahead may yet be long; it may be hard We are sure it will be hard, but it may not be too long It will not be as long as Abraham had to go, nor Moses, nor the other prophets; for we are living in the “last days” now and the final end is not far distant. But whatever time that may be, let the trying of your faith work patience, endurance; and let patience have her work perfect, that you may be perfected m obedience, that is, that you may be found blameless m integrity, doing the Lord’s will at all times, wanting nothing, because you have been faithful m that which is least as well as in much, never wanting in zeal, devotion and obedient effort. Such qualifications you need more than food and clothing. If we seek first the kingdom of heaven, then all these material provisions will be added to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A wise man will never quit a righteous course, no matter what opposition or objections be raised or trials brought to bear upon him So the thing you want is wisdom from above. The apostle James says, “If any of you lack wisdom” under the trying conditions that are bound to come upon you, have faith in the Source of wisdom and appeal to Him. If you lack wisdom for the newly arisen conditions, then ask of God and do so in faith, and lie will give you the wisdom and will point out to you the proper course to take. The proper course to take will always be the one that is submissive to Theocratic rule and that will bring honor and glory to Jehovah’s name and word. Any other course would not be the course of wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The study and training you have had here at the Watchtower Bible College have brought you a much broader knowledge of God’s Word and his organization. You know the course you should follow. You have wisdom; and you will need it. The Loid will permit you to be sorely tried by the Devil as you again go out into the field and begin to put into operation those things that you have learned here. God’s wisdom will be sufficient for you, especially as jou have been better equipped to cany on in the field through those things which you have studied and acquired here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You are free men and women. You have been freed from the bondage of this world because of your love of Christ and j oui following m his footsteps. No longer do you come under the oppressive fear of religion; but, because of your study of God's Word and making a consecration and covenant to do his will, you have become free creatures. Bear well in mind, then, what James further says (1: 25) : “But whoso looketh into the peifect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the five months past you have had one of the ino-l gracious privileges granted to creatures, namely, to devote all your time looking into the perfect law of libeity, the studying of God’s Word, which makes you free from ail oppressive organizations, and particularly free from religion The admonition is that you continue in that law of liberty; and not onlj that, but be not a forgetful hearer. Before you came here vou were oidarned ministers of God. You have now taken this advanced course in Theociatic ministry and have thereby been better prepared for the field. You do not want to forget the things vou have heard and studied here. Y’ou </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font2"> forget them if you did not continue on in the work; but, now that you have heard and studied, the Lord’s admonition is to be a “doer of the woik” And if you are a doer of God’s work, then ‘you shall be blessed in yom deed’. This is a sure promise set forth here in God’s Word and applying to you as you go forth to your future activitv. Having studied, trained and prepared yourselves, as all of the Lord's people do world-wide except that you have had a more gracious and blessed opportunity, you are now responsible to be woikers and to expound and set forth to others the knowledge you have acquired. The Lord guarantees or gives you his sure word that because of your activity m this regard be will bless you in your deed. At times the outlook may be very dark, you might work for months and possibly years and see no apparent results But due to the very fact that God has promised us, therefore you, being not forgetful hearers, but doers of His work, shall be blessed in your activity or deed. The blessed results are sure to appear in due tune in consequence of your obediently going from place to place. The apostles were blessed in their activity, James was, Paul was, and all the faithful servants of the Lord reaped much fruit because they were faithful and wise and kept on fulfilling their commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the parable of “the sower”, as recorded in Luke chapter eight, our Lord pointed out that the seed that fell upon good ground referred to those who are of honest and good heart The account reads: “But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.” (Luke 8:15) It takes time to bring forth fruit with patience; it does not happen in one day. The Lord says: “By their fruits ye shall know them.” So it must be with you student graduates who will go forth from Gilead to different parts of the earth to spread far and wide the Word of God. Some persons you meet will hear but the Devil will take away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and follow after the Lord. Other seed will fall upon the rocks; there men will receive the word with momentary joy, but, as the Master said, it will not find deep root. For a while they will believe, but when the temptations and fiery trials come they will fall away. Other seed will fall among thorns, and hence as it grows it will be choked off through the cares, riches and pleasures of this life, and will not bring forth fruit to perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nevertheless, we are assured that some will fall upon good ground, and it is these to whom the Kingdom publishers will give their special attention. Hence, no matter what the results, you will continue to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. For, as the Master tells us, “No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. Take</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.”—Luke 8:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of you here have been granted invaluable privileges of instruction and service. You should let your light shine more effectively, and the Lord’s rich blessing will be upon you for it. There is no reason why the privileges of service which you have received and will yet be charged with by the Society should ever be taken away from you. If such should occur, it will be because of your own failure due to putting your light under a vessel. But if you let your light from God shine, you will bring forth fruit to the Kingdom and will be blessed of the Most High God. It is work, with patience and faith, that is required on the part of every creature as he continues on m his Christian way. Work is essential today; for, as it is stated m the Scriptures, “even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.” (Jas. 2:17) So the two go hand in hand. We show foith our faith unto our Maker by the works we do. The works we perform are according to the commandments of the Lord as set out in His Word, and which we delight to perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we fulfill our daily task m the great organisation of God now operating in the earth, we must have faith to endure, and the trial of our faith will work patience, or endurance The things we may desire to accomplish as creatures, the things we would like done, do not always occur; but let this not discourage anyone. Because the results are not what we think they should be at the time is no sound reason for discouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us be sure of this one thing: that we have performed our work and shown forth our faith. As ‘the man clothed in linen and with the inkhorn’ reported the matter to the Lord: “I have done as thou hast commanded me.” (Ezek. 9-11) By so doing we shall have the patience required to continue on in God’s service even to the very end. Always be mindful of the Lord’s sure promises to his people, and hope in him. “For thou art my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth.” (Ps. 71: 5) No matter what our days may be in the Lord’s blessed service, our hope in his precious promises should never fail. “Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.”—1 Thess. 5:24</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are living at a time when things happen. No longer are typical pictures being made by God’s covenant people, but we are in the time of fulfillment of prophetic pictures made long ago, and are in the day when prophecies are being brought to completion. At Ephesians 2:12, 13 the apostle contrasts the past and present state of believers from among the Gentiles, saying “That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world • but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ ” We today are not far off The Kingdom is here! Christ Jesus is on his throne at the temple The day of judgment has begun, and we are living in the last days of this evil world and at the threshold of the new You have a wonderful hope. You live in times far more blessed than any that have ever been; times of the outgoing of the Devil’s organization and the expanding operations of Christ’s kingdom over the earth. Now of all times we should be faithful to our commission. It is my prayer that every one of you may continue faithful and steadfast and true to the covenant which you have made with God, and that great and many may be your privilege* in the future, throughout the generations to come under the divine mandate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DIPLOMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To those students who have completed the course at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead with a meritorious passing grade as set up by the Society a diploma or document of attestation will be given. This document will not be given to every student that has attended this college, because the Society, which has founded this institution, must maintain certain high standards of scholarship as to those to whom it grants this diploma The diploma reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Hereby be it known that [the student], an ordained minister of the gospel, has completed the full course of study and training of this college, with merit. He is therefore graduated as specially qualified to engage m educational work, promoting goodwill and working in behalf of permanent peace and the law of perfect order and righteousness, among all peoples. He is specifi cally recommended for service as a representative of the foundei-of this college, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, to colabor with them in preaching the gospel of Jehovah God'* kingdom by Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everyone going forth from this consecrated college will, I feel sure, upon receiving his assignment from the Society, move ahead in the greatest educational campaign ever begun on this-earth, namely, the education of the people of good will in the Word of God; and that henceforth you will always be a promotei of good-will toward Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government; and that you will work in behalf of the Kingdom's permanent peace and its law of perfect order and righteousness “among all peoples”. Enduring peace, perfect order and righteousness can be accomplished only by the unobstructed operation of God's kingdom upon the earth. And it is the good pleasure of the ambassadors of this Kingdom to promote these things now amidst a distressed world. God's people are the only ones at peace, and who are at liberty to perform this great work in the earth Those who receive the diploma which the Society is pleased to bestow as a recommendation for service as its special representatives will, by God’s grace, continue on preaching the gospel of Jehovah God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Being already ordained ministers before becoming college students here, therefore whether a student has finished the course of study with a sufficiently high mark to receive the diploma or not should make no difference to you as individuals in your service to God. And, if continuing faithful, you will not be demoted from your present privileges. Everyone who has finished the course will be given a special assignment by the Society It is our hope that, in due time, all of you may have the privilege of going to other lands in behalf of promoting good-will and peace among the righteous people of those countries With each and every one will go the blessing of Jehovah as you put forth every effort to magnify his name and to make known his Word.</span></p>

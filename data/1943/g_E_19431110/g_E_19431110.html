<p><span class="font6">♦ The Supreme Court of .Louisiana, in ah action originally brought by the City of Shreveport, La., against one of Jehovah’s witnesses, decided that a witness is not “a solicitor, peddler, hawker, <sub>f </sub>itinerant merchant or transient vendor of merchandise” but that &quot;he is admittedly an ordained minister” &quot;who, instead of voicing his views from a pulpit, travels as an itinerant preacher from house to house”. “The fact that relator, as an incident to his preachings, attempts to sell literature which is conformable with his religious beliefs does not alter the nature of his profession or make him a solicitor,‘hawker or itinerant merchant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;To hold otherwise, we would be compelled to attribute to the City Council of Shreveport the intention of declaring that the visitation into homes (without previous invitations) by priests and ministers of all religious denominations, accompanied by the sale of Biblical literature, constitutes a nuisance and a misdemeanor. This we will not do.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ &quot;The Church therefore, is organized as a monarchy in the strictest sense, all power and authority coming from above to the ‘Rulers'; none whatever from below,—from the ‘Ruled’; a principle, which makes the Church in action really equal and identical with Christ himself.” (Page 4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;... but we also think of the Church as reaching out after all who are not yet within; to conquer and compel them to come in.” (P. 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The authority of the Head of Catholic Action directed by the Bishop can be no more questioned within the organization than the authority of the Bishop himself.” (P. 7) —Published by Archdiocese of San Francisco; copyrighted 1939.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y., Wednesday, November 10, 1943 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 630</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Chile, the Super-California of the Antipodes</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">N THE eyes of Californians there is but one place in the United States in which to live, which place, of course, is the Golden State, or the Eldorado State, which stretches from Oregon to Mexico and occupies more than one-half of the Pacific coastline, involving a railway journey of 900 miles. But this is no place to boost California. Go west for that; and when you get to the end of the line you find everybody is a real estate agent, fully convinced that if the Garden of Eden was planted elsewhere it was just an oversight. Well, to b^ honest, it is a paradise. But wait:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California is narrow: it is only 215 miles by rail from San Francisco to the border of the state at the Nevada line. But it isn’t as narrow as Chile. The latter country is only 120 miles wide at the widest place, and in many places it is so narrow that a big Bertha gun such as was fired on Paris in 1918 could stand out in the Pacific ocean ten miles from shore and send a shell clear over into Argentina without touching Chile at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California is long; but it is only one-third as long as its southern rival, which goes from north to south 2,620 miles, as far as from the city of Quebec to the isthmus of Panama. California has 11 peaks with an altitude of more than 14,000 feet (pretty good, that); but in Chile Aconcagua goes up toward the clouds 23,080 feet, and is the highest peak in all the Americas. And it has a string of. other tall peaks, Coreoputi (22,162 feet), El Muerto (21,227), the Baya (19,993), and the Guallatiri (19,882). The highest peak in the Alps is only 15,217 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California has some deserts, but you had better not mention them when you are out in that part of the world. Chile has deserts that are drier than the Sahara. California has big trees that beat the world, including Chile. And California .has fruit that may be mentioned only in praise by everybody except Floridians. But in Qliile there is yearround skiing only a few miles from fields where the best fruit in the world grows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mere Interesting Comparisons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California has only 158,693 square miles; but Chile has 296,717 square miles, and so is larger than Texas and West Virginia put together. But California has 6,907,387 population and, though Chile is coming along, having already 5,000,782 people, it must be admitted that it is as yet a little behind in that regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">California once had a gigantic mining boom, placer mining. That is why the state is still called the Golden State, though, for the most part, the gold has gone. Chile also had a great mining boom, a world monopoly in nitrates, essential in the making of explosives and enrich-&quot; ing the soil; but Germany found a way of taking the nitrogen out of the air for less money, and so Chile’s nitrate boom faded away and widespread poverty resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But now for an authoritative comparison, produced by the National Geographic Society, of Washington, D. C.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one would get a quick conception of the importance, the lovely surroundings, and the climate of Santiago, Chile’s capital, he should set Sari Francisco or Los Angeles down in the most beautiful inland portion of the Valley of California, give the Sierra Nevadas 4,000 feet more height and pile on them more generous caps of snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Santiago, with its nearly three-quarters of * a million population, is fairly comparable in size to Pittsburgh and Boston. Among the Spanish cities of the world only Madrid and Barcelona in the Old World, and Buenos Aires and Mexico City in the New, exceed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But it is not on size that admirers of Santiago base their eulogies. The city, like our own capital, has a subtle charm all its own. Much of this is due to its location. Many travelers agree that it has the most beautiful and inspiring setting of all the great inland cities of the world. It is situated near the upper end of a mountain-rimmed valley, 40 miles long by 20 wide. Ten miles to the east the Andes rise to heights greater than 18,000 feet, presenting a towering wall always snowcapped. On the west is a lower coast range; and to the south stretches a level expanse of fertile farming land divided into large estates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Santiago is built on the plain, but within it rises a 400-foot hill, covering several hundred acres, which has been made into one of the world’s unique parks. Once nearly bare, the hill of Santa Lucia has been transformed into an enchanting modem hanging garden of groves and flower beds, winding roads and trails, cascades, terraces, sylvan theatres and observation kiosks. From its slopes one may obtain numerous charming vistas, and from its top Santiago lies spread out in all its lovely details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• The axis of life in Santiago is the beautiful Alameda de las Delicias, “the tree-lined avenue of the delights,” which cleaves the city in two. Its great breadth of 350 feet is divided by four rows of stately trees. Down the center is the Pasco, a broad promenade, lined by many flower beds and statue-studded little parks, along which innumerable nursemaids herd their romping charges. On either side of the Pasco are the tracks of the electric street railway, and farther outside are broad driveways. [And underground, for thirty blocks, is the new subway, a double track with each track in its own tunnel.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.</span><span class="font4"> J The Alameda is lined with many of the finest residences and public buildings of the capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lover of fresh air comes into his own in Santiago’s delightful climate. Great crowds promenade on the Paseo and in the plazas each evening. Most of the dwellings are of the Spanish type with open courts in the center, in which much of the family’s time is spent. The street-cars are double-deckers, with the upper seats open. Those who wish to climb the steps and enjoy the air and view pay a smaller fee than the passengers who ride on the lower level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An electric railroad connects Santiago with the chief port of Chile, Valparaiso, 117 miles distant. Chile has about 6,000 miles of railroads, over half being state-owned. Harbors are lacking. Steamers stop in the open sea and boats come alongside. The water is filled with sea lions, and the*rowers often have to push them away with their oars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the noteworthy ci ties.of Chile is Antofagasta, a busy town, built upon rock and sand. In order to make a public garden the people had to import earth; but they did so, and their handsome park is a tribute to their tenacity. Here and elsewhere in Chile ancient oxcarts compete with modern railroads; some wages are as low as ten cents a day, but every worker has medical, disability and retirement insurance. Magallanes, a center of the sheep industry, located in the straits of Magellan, is the southernmost city in the world. It was once called Punta Arenas. It is an up-to-date city, with airplane service to Santiago and thence to everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mostly of European Origin</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although, in the Andes, Chile does have some 30,000 natives, called Aran-cans, and although there are an indeterminate number of nomadic Fuegans in Tierra del Fuego, yet the population of Chile is almost entirely of European</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">origin. The language is Spanish. Statistics collected a few years ago showed that Chile then had a rate of only 24 suicides annually for each 1,000,000-people, giving it the best place on the list in that regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a three-column review of Chile published in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> Jackson Reed claimed that “graft, as we know it in the United States and as it is prevalent in Latin America as a whole, has been rare in Chile”. Mr. Reed was trying to rebuild the nitrate industry by his story, but had to sadly admit that whereas in 1913 Chile produced 433,000 tons of nitrate and Europe made but 33,000 tons of the synthetic variety, yet sixteen years later Chile’s production had risen to only 510,000 tons while Europe’s synthetic product had become 1,106,000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The slowing up of the nitrate industry caused much poverty, with its attendant sufferings. One manifestation of this is that Chile has recently had the unenviable record of having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world: 228 out of each thousand children born never reach their first birthday: A prominent Buenos Aires physician who visited Chile in 1937 stated that living conditions at that time were the worst he had seen in forty countries and during thirty years of medical practice. Charles Wedger, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New Masses,</span><span class="font6"> commenting on this, said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the living conditions of the great mass of Chileans remain at an incredibly low level. The worker in the copper mines, for example, who is paid in a fantastically debased currency and burdened with high retail prices and exorbitant sales and transaction taxes, actually earns from ten to fifteen times less than the corresponding worker in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high standard of honesty of the rank and file of the Chileans was emphasized some years ago when a shipment of $3,570,000 in $20 gold pieces came up to New York from the farthest southern republic. The captain of' the vessel, when it docked at Brooklyn, surveyed the great crowd of armed guards facing him and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This money lay in a freight car near our ship, with only one guard with it. The size of the shipment didn’t even cause a mild sensation down in South America. Just look at that gang of guards waiting for it here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chilean prefers wine to chewing-gum. When a North American concern tried to wriggle its way into prominence by advertising its wares, the Chilean government and newspapers took up the subject and made the going hard for the gummers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Education is free and (since 1920) compulsory. There is a government university and . a Catholic university in Santiago. The Roman Catholic religion is dominant though not maintained by the state (since 1925), and all religions are protected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What they had been up to is not known by this scribe, but the New York American of June 7, 1932, had this to say of an event that occurred seven years after church and state had been separated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Groups paraded shouting “Down with the nuns I” Sister Gertrudis, the former Sara Villegas, of Los Angeles, Calif., reported that she and other nuns at Santa Rosa Academy .had been ejected by order of the new government. It was rumored the junta would order all convents evacuated and would use church properties for government purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Religious Impasse”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the above head C. A. Hutchinson, in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> Book Review, comments on the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Good Neighbor Hurdle,</span><span class="font6"> by John W. White, and says some interesting things on the claim that any religious activity inspired by North Americans in South American lands is an obstacle to the “good neighbor” policy’s success. Aside from the well-known fact that the Roman Catholics of North America continually send missionaries to South America, the general attitude of intelligent South Americans themsejves gives the lie to the Hierarchy-inspired furor on the subject. Says Hutchinson:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While a good deal of publicity has recently . been given to North American Protestants, such as Mr. White, who have taken up the cudgels against Protestant missionary work j in Latin America for patriotic reasons, very t little has been heard from the people affected themselves—the Latin-American Catholics. In view of this the following opinion of Mr. Benjamin Subercaseaux, the Chilean writer, may be of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I believe,” he says, “that the importance of the protests against the activities of the -Protestants in our countries has been exaggerated, We in Latin America have duly appreciated and recognized the value of their work, particularly in social affairs, and in no instance have they endangered the stability of our Catholic faith. On the contrary, they have alleviated both the physical and spiritual need of the masses and have helped to give impetus and strength to the somewhat feeble activities of some Catholic groups. Besides this, the Constitutions of our countries, being openly democratic, have never exerted official pres<sup>:</sup> sure to stop Protestants from acting freely in South America. Any inclination of our governments to limit the freedom of any religious sect would be very unfavorably viewed and would raise a storm of protest. Thus, then, the act of offering us now’ a limitation of freedom of belief as a proof of Good Neighborliness is like serving us a totalitarian dish to reward our good anti-Nazi feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earthquakes and Volcanoes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is no disgrace to California or to Chile that they both have earthquakes and volcanoes. California is quite proud of its one lone volcano with its feeble eruptions, but it never has anything to say about its earthquakes. It just isn’t done. The great San Francisco earthquake is always euphemistically called “the San Francisco fire”. Thou seest, 0 real estate investor, that nobody wants real estate that may close up like an accordion or be disemboweled from beneath. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✓ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in Chile they cannot dodge the fact that they have earthquakes, because in the seventeen years from 1907 to 1924 they had 12,694 quakes; and if you figure it up you learn that that is just a little bit more than two per day. In the great, earthquake of January, 1939, about 700,000 persons were made homeless. It was not believed that permanent structures to replace those ruined could be completed in less than ten years, so great barracks were built for the needy in many places along the sixteen hundred; miles that the quake extended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the city of Valdivia, on occasion of another earthquake, when the buildings began to shake the city band was brought out and played in the streets, and with excellent effect upon the people. It is believed that no experience of man is as terrifying as that of the earthquake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Chilean volcanoes erupt they mean business. They have been known to darken the sun for six hundred miles around and to drop their ashes in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and in Montevideo, Uruguay, A severe eruption destroys the grass for miles around the volcano, owing to the volcanic dust. But afterwards the region is richer in vegetation than it was before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like other countries, Chile has occasional disastrous storms. In the year 1934, in a few seconds, about five o’clock in the morning, a gigantic waterspout ' came up the'Bio-Bio river into the center of the city of Concepcion, and before you could say Jack Robinson it cut a swath 200 yards wide across thirty blocks. Light dwellings were reduced to matchwood and $1,000,000 damage was done. The same storm cut the longitudinal railroad joining the northern provinces with the capital, not in one place, but in fifty places. That is going some, even for Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Great Mineral Riches</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until the process of obtaining nitrogen from the air was made commercially profitable, the two desert provinces of Chile, namely, Tarapaea and Antofagasta, produced 95 percent of the world’s nitrate supply. At present, only about 25 of the 152 nitrate works are in operation. About 75 percent of the world’s iodine supply comes as a by-product from the nitrate operations. Chile is the world’s-second-largest producer of copper. The provinces of Atacama and Coquimbo have enormous iron deposits, estimated at a billion tons. There are beds of coal estimated to contain two billion tons. And there are generous deposits of gold, silver, cobalt, zinc, manganese, borate, salt, sulphur, marble and onyx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chile has 38 percent of the world’s copper reserve, to compare with 34 percent for the United States. The Chu-quicamata copper mines, owned by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, are rated as worth $220,000,000 and are alone estimated to contain one-fourth of the world’s available copper reserves. In 1941 the miners in this mine won a substantial wage increase after a long, hard-fought strike. The development of copper mining has been conducted chiefly by American interests. The Guggenheims could have paid the copper miners decent wages and still made vast additions to the millions or billions of dollars which they control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It might not occur to everybody that arable land constitutes mineral riches, but such is the case. Soils must have minerals to be productive. Chile has 95 million acres of arable land. In a recent year the chief crops, wheat, grapes, barley, oats, porn, potatoes and fruit, occupied only 2,036,000 acres, or only a little over 2 percent of the lands that could have been used to advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chile has many large dairy farms. Wheat, barley, oats, beans, lentils, apples, - melons, peaches, plums, nectarines, peas and potatoes are grown in abundance. Chile ranks seventh among wine-producing countries. Commerce seems to have double-crossed the agricultural worker in Chile. At a time when cattle there sold for one or two pesos a head (the peso is worth 21c), the price charged there for a bale of European paper was at least a hundred pesos, and an imported cape or coat cost five hundred pesos. As a consequence, clothes were handed down from generation to generation, like landed estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foreign Influence</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thomas J. Hamilton, correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> writing from Santiago in March, 1942, makes some observations that will interest many' at this time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As far as anybody can tell, German-Chileans of the second and third generation here are not keen Nazis, although many apparently are forced to contribute to the party. The first generation German-Chileans, however, perhaps 50,000 or 60,000, and the 11,000 native-born Germans are likely sources of trouble. There are also some Italians and Japanese, but not enough to affect opinion. Large numbers of Chilean Army officers trained by Germans are pro-Axis and they exert considerable influence. But the persons who are opposing the United States most effectively are not so much pro-German or pro-Italian or pro-Japanese, as pro-totalitarians. These are found among the wealthy, conservative ultra-Catholic aristocrats, although, of course, not all of these are prototalitarian. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other words, every 'time you turn over this totalitarian stone you find the same kind of bugs under it, and you know who is at the bottom of the world deviltry designated as “The New Order”. A year before the Jesuits shoved Hitler into his wild plan for grabbing the world, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font6"> in its issue of September 24, 1938, had this report regarding work already done in Chile:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coast of southern Chile and the Straits of Magellan at the southernmost point of the continent figure largely in German strategic plans. Naval experts are all agreed that here are the best possible positions for operations both, east and west of South America. Countless hidden bays offer concealment to cruisers and submarines, and a rich hinterland is an inexhaustible source of supplies, Moreover, living in southern Chile are tens of thousands of Germans who distinguished themselves in the last war by their fanatical support of German interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Years ago the German Admiralty assured \ itself of the islands of Juan Fernandez, Mas </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Tierra and Mas a Fuera, off the coast of central Chile, by a very simple expedient. German naval officers and sailors with a love for the beauties of these Pacific islands were sent to Mas a Tierra, popularly believed to be the island of Robinson Crusoe, to make it their permanent home. About a year ago Goebbels sent another shipload of Germans to this island to produce the story of Robinson Crusoe for the films. Nominally these islands, which lie in the Pacific about a thousand kilometers from. Valparaiso, belong to Chile; actually the Germans are in complete control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In September,.1941, the Chilean police arrested 28 leaders of Nazi activities in various cities. The men were all influential members of the Landesgruppen, Blockgruppen and Or tsgr upper;,., which organizations, it would seem at this time, have, as it were, bitten off more than they can chew. This business of grabbing the world regardless of the will of Almighty God, Jesus Christ or anybody else except the Devil, has its drawbacks. Two months later, the German section of Chile (in and about the cities of Valdivia, La Union, Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas) was considered to be under good governmental control, despite the fact that in those cities are some families that still do not speak Spanish, and that in them the German language may be heard everywhere (as in Milwaukee and Cincinnati). Nevertheless, the following summer a special cable to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> of May 23, 1942, had this item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Police authorities were active throughout today investigating the discovery of bombs, hand grenades and packages of dynamite hidden in the homes of leaders of the Chilean Nazi party which has been rechristened the Popular Socialist Vanguard. The results </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the investigation have not been made public but the newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Segundo,</span><span class="font4"> reported tonight that eighty-four packages of dynamite had been discovered in one of the houses and that arrests were being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Relations with the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The relations of Chile with the United States are probably better than surface indications suggest. Immediately after Pearl Harbor the Chilean government declared the United States a non-belligerent in the world conflict, thus granting full use Of the Chilean waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man selected as minister of foreign affairs, Ernesto Barros Jarpa, is considered one of the best friends the United States has in Chile. He is professor of international law at the University of Chile and is a distinguished lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The war has brought a boom in Chile, and the United States is by agreement and in fact her best customer. She is expecting to ship 500,000 tons of copper annually to Uncle Sam, and about 800,000 tons of nitrates, not to mention 1,600,000 tons of high-grade iron ore and 60,000 tons of manganese. Moreover, though Uncle does not want and does not need any more gold at the fancy prices he is now paying, yet for thejiext three years he will buy all of it that Chile has to sell. It is a good thing to have a rich and well-disposed uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In October, 1942, Sumner Welles, at that time the United States undersecretary of state, in an address in Boston, mightily stirred the politicians of two hemispheres when he asserted that Chile was allowing Nazi agents to transmit from their country information causing the sinking of ships and was not complying with its international obligations. Six months of feverish discussion followed and diplomatic relations with the Axis powers were broken off, and a lend-lease agreement that the defense of Chile is vital to the defense of the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">States was signed by the two nations in March, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A little later, the Chilean government agreed to speed Up the smelting of copper, opening at least one new smelter for that purpose, while Washington agreed to send down 64,000 'tons of coal to be used on the Arica-La Paz Railroad, over which, through Chile, most of Bolivia’s tin is exported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Good Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chilean government at present is a good government, as governments go. Under the constitution (1925) the president is elected for six years, the 45 senators for eight, and 143 deputies for four, all by direct popular vote. All male persons 21 years of age, and able to read and write, may vote, and if such person does not vote he is fined the equivalent of $1.50 unless he presents a doctor’s certificate. In the last election, out of a registration of 580,000 voters, 460,015 votes were cast. Forcing a man to vote is like forcing him to kiss his wife. The liberal and highly esteemed Popular Front candidate, Juan Antonio Rios, received a plurality of about 55,000 votes over General Ibanez, who had the totalitarian crowd back of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since November, 1928, gambling has been illegal in Chile. Don’t you think that is a pretty high standard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time, fifteen years ago, there were some pretty savage methods of maintaining political and governmental supremacy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font6"> of September 5 of that year ran a sketch of the cara-bineros which contained these not too happifying sentences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Has anyone ever seen a Chilean labor leader who has been deported? According to the tales that are current in barrooms and barbershops, the men are taken a few miles out to sea on a warship and then lined up at the gunwales. The rail is taken down behind them and a squad of marines makes a charge with fixed bayonets. Thrown overboard? What am I talking about? They jumped overboard in an effort to escape. The official naval report says so. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The carabineros have a similar trick. If they have to take a man a long way after arresting him, if the desert sun is hot and they are anxious to get home, if the prisoner walks too slowly to keep up with their horses, they stop and tell him to run away. If he doesn’t want to run, they pummel the desire into him with the stocks of their guns, or prod it- into him with their lances. After he has run some fifty yards, they level their carbines and shoot him. They are trained to get their man, dead or alive. They can always turn in the report that their prisoner tried to escape and they had to shoot him. [Sounds like Little Steel.—Ad. ]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such is the operation of the infamous Ley de Fuga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Good Detective Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They have as good detectives in Chile as anywhere on earth. In 1930 fifteen persons, including two major generals, made a plot to kill the thep president. They placed twenty-five pounds of dynamite under a railroad bridge a short time before the presidential train was to pass. Then the detectives seized them and disco’nneeted the wires. A clue to the plot was found in the purchase by the plotters of 4,500 feet of electric wire, a dead giveaway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not all Chileans are honest. Some are like some of the citizens in, Jersey City, or Kansas City, or some other cities. At Santiago, in 1931, 500 men showed up at the home of the defeated candidate for president and asked for the ten pesos apiece which they had been promised for voting for him. They didn’t get it. They seldom do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some Chileans are sensitive, like some of those who live in Mississippi who don’t want anything said that mighficast a reflection on their religion. A. L. ^Randall, American foreman at nitrate plant in Chile, wrote an article for a California magazine in which he said, “Chilean workers are the laziest on earth”; and the gentleman was </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font6">ediately deported. So, look out what you write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chileans are progressive. Another railway, including a four-mile tunnel, pierces the Andes and provides rail or highway service between the Chilean cities of Talcahuano, Lebu and Valdivia and the Atlantic port of Bahia Blanca, in i Argentina. They already had several transandine railway routes through the great mountain barrier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1934 it is illegal for Socialists to enter Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chileans can talk back. When accused of aiding Bolivia in the Gran Chaco war they came back by naming all the principal International Murderers Inc. in Britain, United States, France, Sweden, Holland, Norway, Belgium, Spain, and Czechoslovakia (curiously omitting Germany), and telling of their respective sales to both belligerents in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chilean cedula. system of compulsory identification passes, containing photograph, signature, and thumbprint tor all citizens, and repeated every seven years for growing children, is of inestimable value to all the law-abiding and is certain to catch all criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The advantages of the cedula system are numerous. Lost persons are readily traced, criminals usually identified, voters limited to one vote each (for the cedula has to be left behind until the close of the voting day, making it impossible for anyone to vote two or three times). It is almost compulsory to be honest in Chile. War pensions are paid only to those who are entitled to them; another cannot claim them in the name of the pensioner, whether before or after his death. The cedula is the answer to many a difficulty, and is one of the many things that make Chile a progressive nation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Investigating Radio Repairmen</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE two investigators used a very simple system. Traveling *from one end of the country to the other, they had with them brand-new portable radio sets of two nationally-known makes, the sets being in flawless condition. Wherever they stopped they first unsnapped one of the wires inside of the set which are generally connected by means of snapfasteners, or they pulled up a tube so it did not make contact. The set was then closed and presented to the radio repairman. The results make interesting reading, not only for the layman, but particu-, larly for the radio industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The investigators visited 304 radio repair shops and found that 64 out of 100 cheated. It is significant to note that in localities under 10,000 population only 51 percent were dishonest, but in the larger centers 66 percent were found to be dishonest. In New York and its metropolitan area the tremendous dishonesty proportion of 17 out of 19 shop owners that lied and cheated was recorded. The first 36 shops visited in eastern towns sold the investigators 32 new tubes when, as a matter of fact, not a single tube was needed—all the tubes in the investigators’ sets being brand-new and perfect!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The investigators had a grand time in catching the dishonest repairman redhanded. They used a simple system in doing this. Practically all standard tubes are marked, “Made in U.S.A.” By scratching off the periods of the “U.S.A,”, this then appeared as &quot;U S A”. Thus it was possible to spot the dishonest repairman who charged for new tubes when they had not even changed any. Frequently they took out the set’s new tubes and installed inferior kinds; at other times they deliberately burned out the tubes in fictitious “tests”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Radio-Craft,</span><span class="font6"> September, 1941.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Totalitarian Blueprint</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE blueprint for world domination by a totalitarian confederacy of dictator states with the Boman Catholic Church riding on top is no secret document; simply drop a postcard to the National Catholic Welfare Conference, 1312 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Washington, D. C., and you will receive “a complete publications folder listing some 350 N.Q.W.C. pamphlets”. You don’t have to read all these 350 pamphlets to find out what the “Church&quot; is driving at; ' a few selections will suffice. You might begin, for example, with a little 17-page essay by the “Rt. Rev.&quot; Msgr. John A. Ryan, D.D., entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Relation of Catholicism to Fascism, Communism and Democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first paragraph is a sugar-coating quotation from Pope Leo XIII which assures you that “the right to rule is not necessarily, however, bound up with any special mode of government. It may take this or that form, provided only that it be of a nature to insure the general welfare”. Msgr. Ryan adds his assurance that what Leo means is that “more than one form of government may be satisfactory to Catholicism. The only important limitation is that the polity must be conducive to the general welfare”. Surely nothing here to frighten any politician, democratic or fascist. But then you read on and find that for any government to be “conducive to the general welfare” it must first be subjected to that very “important limitation”, which limitation means that its power and authority over you must come with blessings from “the Eternal City, episcopal See of the Sovereign Pontiff, center of the Catholic world&quot;. Msgr. Ryan offers you, as a shining example of a modern state which “insures the general welfare”, the present Fascist nation of Portugal. On pages 10-11 you are told that “Portugal is, indeed, a corporative state”; but because in government, economics and education Portugal </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;acknowledges the limitations placed upon governmental power by the laws of morality&quot;, </span><span class="font6">it is not “genuinely nor completely totalitarian” : “Apparently, there. is nothing in either the political or economic constitution of Portugal which is out of harmony with Catholicism.” If Msgr. Ryan leaves you hazy about what kind of state Portugal really is, then consult another monsignor at this point, &quot;Rt. Rev.” Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen. In his N.C.W.C. brochure entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom and Democracy,</span><span class="font6"> Msgr. Sheen tells you, on page 14, that “the State which acknowledges God [that is, the pope] and the spiritual element in man [meaning the 'Church’s’ jurisdiction over a man], is a Free State”. Portugal recognizes both pope and Catholic jurisdiction, and, in the language of Catholic logic, Portugal is a free state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;His Holiness” and &quot;His Excellency, Signor Cavaliere” Benito</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now back to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Relation of Catholicism to Fascism, etc.:</span><span class="font6"> On pages 6-7 Msgr, Ryan calls Mussolini’s Italy a “dictatorship&quot;. At first glance the monsignor finds it’s a pretty ugly picture: “This dictatorship is to be preserved by propaganda if possible, by violence if necessary, . . . Fascism rejects liberty of speech, of the press, of assembly and of political opposition. All these attitudes and principles are contrary to Catholic doctrine.” But now don’t be frightened, this cruel and bloody dictator is not mistreating </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">papa,</span><span class="font6"> but is in fact accepting the &quot;Holy Father” as 'god and treating the Hierarchy like “Princes of the blood”. “The Fascist government has been content to let its totalitarian principles remain for the most part in the realm of inoperative theory,” says Msgr. Ryan. (Page 7) Not meaning, of course, that propaganda and violence, and repression of liberty of speech, of the press, of assembly and of political opposition,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">have been left “in the realm of inoperative theory”; what .Monsignor means is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For example, it [Italian Fascism] has made a concordat with the Church, thus recognizing the juridical existence of the latter.” (Page 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Should one care for a look at this coni cordat between Pius and Benito, the N.C.W.C. will supply the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Official Text and Translation of the Treaty 'between the Holy See and Italy.</span><span class="font6"> This pamphlet contains three documents: first, the Treaty, then the Financial Agreement, and then the Concordat proper. All three are signed by Benito Mussolini. Page 1-informs you that Pius XT and King Victor Emmanuel III left the whole arrangement up to the pope’s secretary of state, Cardinal Gasparri, and this avowed atheist, thug and murderer, “His Excellency, Signor Cavaliere Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister and Head of the Government.” Article 1 of the Treaty recognizes and reaffirms that “the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the sole religion of the State”; Article 2 recognizes “the sovereignty of the Holy See” as an independent world power, while Article 12 guarantees that Vatican City’s international diplomatists, such as President Roosevelt’s ambassador, Myron C. Taylor, shall be accorded protection and immunity by Italian authorities anywhere in Italy, whether the United States government or any other government will recognize diplomatic relations with Italy or not. Articles 8 and 21 declare that the person of the pope is “as sacred and inviolable” as the king’s own person, and that the Fascist state is to guarantee him equal protection with the king, from all his enemies, while “All Cardinals are entitled in Italy to such honors as are due Princes of the blood”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for the financial rake-offs which the Hierarchy, under false pretenses of representing God, takes in from its different outfits in Britain, America and all other nations, besides other sources </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12 </span><span class="font6">of income, Article 17 provides that all such “are exempt from taxation anywhere in Italian territory”. And then there is that little matter of the Papal States. During the Dark Ages the Papacy by use of forged documents supposed to have been signed by the apostle Peter, and by other means equally fraudulent and wicked, gained possession of a number of Italian states. Subsequently these had been restored to the realm of Italy, which “loss” the Papacy was bitterly bemoaning when Cavaliere Benito arrived upon the scene. And now, out of touching gratitude to this inhuman dictator, the “Holy Father” agrees to leave these Papal States in the hands, of Mussolini and accept in their stead a paltry 750,000,000 Italian lire to he collected from the Italian people, plus one billion lire worth of 5 percent negotiable Italian State bonds. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Financial Agreement,</span><span class="font6"> pp. 13-14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Concordat</span><span class="font6"> which follows confirms the 27 Articles of the Treaty, and as an added gesture of the “Church’s” love for Italian Fascism, Article 12 provides that “on Sundays and holy days of obligation, in churches having a canonical chapter, the celebrant of the Conventual Mass will sing, according to the regulations of the sacred liturgy, a prayer for the prosperity of the King of Italy and the Italian State”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, by Article 20, Italian bishops before taking possession of their dioceses must take an oath of “loyalty” at the hands of the head of state, according to the following formula:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before God on the Holy Gospels, I swear and promise, as becomes a Bishop, loyalty to the Italian State. I swear and promise to respect, and to make my clergy respect, the King and Government established according to the constitutional laws of the State. I swear and promise, moreover, that I shall not participate in any agreement or take part in any discussion that might 'be injurious, to the Italian State or detrimental to public order and that I shall not permit my clergy to take part in such. Being mindful of the welfare</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font4">and of the interests of the Italian State, I shall endeavor to ward off any danger that may threaten it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And in return for these “singing prayers” and oaths of fidelity to Fascism, Mussolini agreed (Article 29, Sect, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h)</span><span class="font6"> to rescind all past taxes wherever they concern the “Church”, and to impose no future taxes “whatsoever on Church property”; in Article 34 he turned the institution of marriage over to the administration of the “Church”, and in Articles 36, 37 and 38 education is likewise placed in her hands. Obviously Mussolini’s Italy, like Salazar’s Portugal, met all the requirements of what the Hierarchy calls a “free state”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What the N.C.W.C. Doesn’t Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two important documents are missing from the 350 pamphlets published by the National Catholic Welfare Conference; probably they’ll be along any day now. One is the concordat between the Vatican and Hitler, negotiated by Papal Secretary Pacelli (now Pius XII), within six months after Hitler shattered the German Republic under the Nazi fist The other is the understanding between the Vatican and Japan’s Hirohito, made after Pearl Harbor. Nevertheless, in other publications, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Insurrection in Spain,</span><span class="font6"> which tells the “Catholic truth” about the slaughter of the Spanish Republic, the N.C.W.C. offers you a hindsight view of Hitler and Mussolini coming to the aid of Franco, who restored “the rights of God and of conscience” in that nation. (P. 5) This unholy killer, Franco, is pictured (pp. 15-16) as “a man who had given evidence of loyally to the Republic”, and a footnote on page 16 informs you that Franco’s Proclamation, by which he started the insurrection, is such an “important document” that a translation of it is given in Appendix A, pp. 39-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “Dishops’ Program”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take a look at the following legislative program: (1) Minimum wage legislation; (2) insurance against unemployment, sickness, invalidity, and old age; (3) a sixteen-year minimum age limit for working children; (4) the legal enforcement of the right of labor to organize; (5) continuation of the National War Labor Board; (6) a national employment service; (7) public housing for the working classes; (8) no general reduction of wartime (1918) wages and a longdistance program of increasing them; (9) prevention of excessive profits and incomes through a regulation of rates . . . and through progressive taxes; (10) participation of labor in management and a wider distribution of ownership through co-operative enterprises and worker ownership; (11) effective control of monopolies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Maybe you thought these principles originated during the past ten years of the New Deal administration. Well, they didn’t; read the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bishop’s Program,</span><span class="font6"> and you’ll find that away back in 1919 the Administrative Committee of the National Catholic War Council published these recommendations and proposals. In a fore-word to the 20th anniversary edition of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bishops' Program</span><span class="font6"> (1939), the “Most Rev.” Edward Mooney, archbishop of Detroit, tells you that while these eleven principles have become to a great degree the foundation stones of the Roosevelt administration, yet they are only “a moderate application of Catholic moral principles to social and industrial life”, and do not offer even “a fundamental scheme” for the overhauling of America along the lines of an out-and-out “new social order” such as now enjoyed by such “free states” as Portugal and Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the fact that most Americans are not' yet Catholics and are not aware that the nation’s political and economic movement is following the blueprint laid down in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bishops’ Program,</span><span class="font6"> we are not correctly aware of the real nature of the “New Order” the “Church” has in store for us. Hence,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">there is a black and dangerous pit directly before us; as the archbishop puts it: “In fact, it is not too much to say that outside the sphere of Catholic , thought most intellectuals are advocating some kind of collectivism, either a moderate form of socialism or out and - out communism.” (P. 7) This is the ever* recurring </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">motif</span><span class="font6"> running through all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catholic propaganda—the “red” scare. Just as cavaliers Mussolini and Hitler are now engaged in a “Holy Crusade” to wipe communism out of Russia and return that country to the folds of religion, just as Franco the Killer felt it his patriotic duty to “save” Spain from communism, even so now the “Church” feels it her “obligation” to apply “fundamental remedies” to “save” America from her pitiful plight I Either she turns “red” or allows the &quot;Church” to save her. There is no alternative. Declares the archbishop, America, like other nations now “saved” by the “New Order”, must straightway direct her steps along that “sound and comprehensive plan of social reconstruction in our late Holy Father’s epoch-making encyclical ‘Quadragesimo Anno’ and, by any and all means, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;our long-range efforts should</span><span class="font6"> be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">directed to the realization of the papal plan for a new social order&quot;</span><span class="font6"> (P. 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Liberal illusion”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If these five N.C.W.C. publications fail to show you what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is driving at, then there is one more book which will clear your vision. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Liberal Illusion,</span><span class="font6"> sub titled “A Refutation of the Fallacious Slogans of Recently Resurgent Liberalism”, was written by Louis Veuillot in 1866, and sets forth in sulphurous language the aims of the “church” to gain unquestionable world domination so clearly that the N.C.W.C. still publishes it as a favorite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Liberalism is the world’s greatest enemy, cries Veuillot; not mere economic liberalism, as expressed in Adam Smith’s “equal opportunity” and “rugged individualism” slogans. Of course, the “chronic social sickness” which such economic liberalism has brought upon all modern nations can never be cured “until the last cankerous vestige of liberalism has been eliminated from human society”. (P. 19) Ricardo’s law of wages, “an outrage on humanity&quot; that “led straight to the Class War” and communism, along with such Masonic slogans as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“liberty, fraternity, equality&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> must go. (Pp. 19, 16) But the worst kind of liberalism is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Religious Liberalism,</span><span class="font6"> And the worst kind of religious liberalism is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Liberalism!</span><span class="font6"> (P. 20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The liberal Catholic is neither Catholic nor liberal. . . . Everything about him betokens the Sectary: that is his</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' real name.” (P. 32) “Catholic liberalism and the spirit of the world are blood brothers; they shade into each other by imperceptible degrees.” “I believe them to be introducing among us a heresy, and one of the most out and out heresies the world has ever-seen.” (P. 35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And what is to be done about liberal Catholics! Next time you read or hear that Hitler and other dictators are persecuting Catholics, remember Veuillot’s words. Hitler is indeed persecuting Catholics—but liberal Catholics; not the ironclad Hierarchy backing him up. It is all part of the “Church’s” plan to burn out the last vestige of liberalism on earth and Catholic liberalism first of all. On the subject of liberal Catholicism, which allows for such “heresies” as separation of religion and state, secularized education and other institutions of republican government, Veuillot declares that “the Church will pronounce judgment at the proper time, if there be occasion to do so”. The “proper time” is in these days, and the “Church” has raised up her totalitarian dictators to meet the “occasion”. It was liberalism among her own “children” that led to the “Church’s” downfall, declares Veuil- * lot: “Had Catholic unity been maintained until the 16th century, there would no</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">longer be any infidels', nor idolaters, nor slaves; the human race would be Christian today.” (P. 38)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ultimatum to the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jesus Christ is the King of the world. He speaks to the world through His Priest [the pope], and the decrees of this Priest, being an expression of the royal rights of Jesus Christ, are eternal. They apply not to one time alone, but to all times; not to one society alone, but to all societies; not to some men, but to all men.” (P. 37)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The children of the Christ, the children of the King, are kings. They form an absolutely superior society, whose duty it is to take possession of the earth and reign over it. ...&quot; (Same page) Such is the ghastly, blasphemy against Jehovah’s Son, the Prince of Peace, and the decree of the “Church” to all nations on earth. And under this unholy setup rising out of Europe and overrunning all the earth, the “Church&quot; is the head and the state is the arm of the monster: “The one is the head, the other the arm; the one is the supreme and sovereign word of the Pontiff, the other the social power.” (Pp. 37-38)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On pages 38 and 39 the “Old Lady” is pictured riding her beast:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two powers, united, distinct and one above the other, whereby [Catholic] society is ruled, have been called the two swords. For the word would be of no avail, if it could not be at certain moments a sword. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the Pontiff who bids it [the sword of the State] come forth from the scabbard and who bids it return thereto. Its duty is to repress aggressive error, once it has been defined and condemned [as a free conscience, liberalism, and the preaching of Jehovah’s purposes are now condemned], to shackle it, to strike it down; to give protection to the truth [Catholic “truth”], whether the latter is under the necessity of defending itself, or has need, in its turn, to go on the offensive. The secular arm ought to clear the way for the truth, to assure it liberty of teaching, to guard afar the way of its ambassadors and of its followers. . . . Such are the duties of the power obedient to the commandment of the Pontiff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Same Holds for America</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever they remain today, institutions of free government are being totally undermined and destroyed by the Vatican’s agents, all of which is in full accord with the demoniacal scheme laid down by Veuillot, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In short, with reference to modern constitutions we conduct ourselves in much the same way that a person does with reference to taxes; we pay the taxes while demanding that they be reduced; we obey the constitutions while demanding that they undergo amendment. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To expect more of us is to expect too much. </span><span class="font6">Modern constitutions, founded by popular, or democratic, consent must go, declares Veuillot, because they threaten the “drastic elimination of the whole [Catholic] idea”. You will find these words on pages 68 and 69. But if there is any doubt in your mind as to to whom they are addressed, turn back to page 23. There the introduction tells you plainly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One concluding remark: it may be objected that what Veuillot has written holds true of European liberalism but not of liberalism as the term is understood in America. By the time the reader has finished </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Liberal illusion,</span><span class="font4"> he will know that this is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Nervous Conquerors</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Aryan conquerors of Europe continue to be nervous. The Netherlanders have a bad habit of stealing airplanes and seaplanes and skipping to England with them. This has made it necessary to remove the- propellers from isolated planes at night. At Tromsoe, Norway, orders have been issued that no fisherman may go out more than five miles without being fired on. This rule is made because so many Norwegian fishermen have braved the 500 miles of stormy waters in the North sea to get to a land of liberty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Was He Raised?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font6">ETER, the Jewish-Chrlstian apostle who had a pe'rsonalmeet-up with Him after His quickening from the dead, writes: “Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust; that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit, in which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison?’ (1 Peter 3:18,19, Douay Bible Version) Almighty God had promised to give Christ Jesus immortality, giving Him the power and authority to have inherent life when resurrected from the dead to life in the spirit. Then, as the “express image of his [Father’s] person”, He would have life within himself and need nothing to sustain life, Jesus said: “As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself?’—John 5:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before His death on the tree at Calvary He lived as a man on earth. When He was raised from the dead He was “the image of the invisible God”. (Colossians 1:15) “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of [God’s] person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” (Hebrews 1:3,4) At the time of His baptism in Jordan river, when God’s spirit descended upon Him, He was begotten of His Father to life in the spirit. At His resurrection He was the “firstborn from the dead&quot; unto life immortal in the spirit. (Colossians 1:18; Revelation 1: 5) When He was raised from the dead He was both Lord and Christ, says Peter. (Acts 2: 36) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord</span><span class="font6"> means one who owns, and who has power and authority, and whom His followers acknowledge as Master and Lord, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font6"> means “anointed”, and designates the One whom Jehovah has appointed to carry out His . great purpose. So now, Christ Jesus being raised from the dead, He is both owner of all things under God and endowed with power and authority to carry out Jehovah’s purpose. The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus </span><span class="font6">means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Savior,</span><span class="font6"> that is, Savior of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">His </span><span class="font6">people, and was His name given at His human birth. It is more particularly associated with Him as the Sin-Bearer, the One who made His soul an offering for sin, who suffered for us and bore our sins, and whom Isaiah 53 further describes as a “man of sorrows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When He raised Jesus from the dead Jehovah God highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above all other names. He was once a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Now, resurrected from the dead, He is the exalted One. Hence the apostle Paul declares: “Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto' death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father?’—Philip-pians 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has decreed that since the earth was the scene of Jesus’ suffering for the vindication of .Jehovah’s name, it shall be the scene of glory for Him also, and that all creatures thereon shall bow at the name or exalted office of Jesus, and that every creature shall confess that Jesus is Christ and is the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the first day of the week when Jesus was raised from the dead, and on several oocasions thereafter, He ap-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">peared to His disciples and others who specially loved Him. He did not appear to them in the same body that was hung on the tree; nor with the same clothing in which He was buried. The Scriptural account is that the burial clothing and a napkin were folded up and laid aside in the tomb. Had He appeared in the same body that was entombed, those who were with Him for three and a half years would have recognized Him readily. Surely Mary Magdalene would have known Him. He appeared to her as a gardener on one occasion, and only when He spoke her name in the tone so familiar to her did she recognize Him. That appearance to her on Sunday morning, early in the day of His resurrection, was near the sepulcher.—John 20:11-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the same Sunday morning He appeared to the women returning from the sepulcher, and also to Simon Peter alone near Jerusalem. (Matthew 28:9,10; Luke 24: 34; 1 Corinthians 15: 5) On the same.day He later disclosed himself to two disciples with whom He completed the journey to Emmaus. (Luke 24:13-21) That Sunday evening He appeared to the apostles (except Thomas) at Jerusalem. One week later (Sunday evening) He appeared again to the apostles, Thomas being present this time, at Jerusalem. (John 20:19-29) Some days thereafter He appeared on the shores of Galilee to seven of His disciples that had gone back to fishing. (John 21:1-13) A little later He appeared to the eleven disciples on a mountain near Galilee. (Matthew 28:16-20) A short time thereafter He again appeared to a company of more than five hundred of His followers, gathered by appointment, in Galilee. (1 Corinthians 15:6) He again appeared to the apostle James only. (1 Corinthians-15:7) Then He appeared for the last time on the side of the Mount of Olives to His disciples at the time of His ascension to heaven.—Luke 24: 50, 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did He, then, appear in a spirit body or a human body, and how did He get</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMB ER 10* 1943 </span><span class="font6">the body if it was not the one in which He was crucified? We may be sure that He was hot raised from the: dead with a human body, because on one of these occasions He appeared to the disciples when they Were in a room with the doors fastened. (John 20:19-26) The only Scriptural answer is that now, as a spirit with all power in heaven and in earth, He had the power to create a body and clothing and appear at any time and upon any occasion He desired. Hence Mary supposed Him to be a gardener; the two disciples on the road to Emmaus thought He was a stranger in the community. At the sea of Galilee none of the disciples recognized Him by His assumed body; likewise on other occasions when He appeared to them. On all these occasions He was recognized by His actions, His words, and the familiar tone of His voice. It was hard to convince Thomas, who declared He must have some more proof. Therefore the Lord created a body having in it the marks of the nails, in order that Thomas might be convinced.—John 20:27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of Jesus’ appearing to the disciples was that the fact might be fully established that He was resurrected and alive. He had the power to create a fleshly body and appear in it and to dissolve it at any time. Without doubt, when He appeared to the disciples behind locked doors He created the body immediately in their presence, and dissolved it when He disappeared. To prove to them that He was manifesting himself in a real body of flesh and bones He said to them: “Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” (Luke 24:39) At the Mount of Olives when He ascended and then disappeared from their sight, the spirit body in which He proceeded on high, and which He has in heaven, was a glorious body which no man can look _ upon. “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”—1 Corinthians 15:50,51.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>^Pestilences, Famines and Earthquakes’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HOSE who doubt that this is the time of the end, even as Jesus foretold, should mark the great number of earthquakes, famines and pestilences accompanying the present wars. (Matthew 24:7; Revelation 6:4,5,8) These reapers add daily to the harvest of war-dead, bringing to the insatiable grave millions that have not fallen by the sword or bomb. “Hell and destruction are never full.” (Proverbs 27:20; 30:15,16) Remarkable on the credit side of the Ledger of Life and Death are man’s efforts to stay the Destroyer, revealing man’s ingenuity, man’s impotence, man’s overwhelming defeat. Such also are signs of the crumbling world whose end has come before our eyes. The New World soon to follow this passing era will achieve victories over all man’s enemies, which he.has fought without hope, pitifully in vain.—-1 Corinthians 15:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. The rivals to War in destructiveness, and War’s inevitable camp-followers, are Pestilence and Famine. While their ravages have not been felt in America as yet to any great extent, disease and starvation are heavy upon foreign lands. “Europe called on the verge of fearful epidemics,” says Doctor Paul R. Cannon, of Chicago University. “Certainly in time,” he continued, “the problem of malnutrition will dominate the panoramic picture of the entire war. War dropsy has reappeared all over conquered Europe. Rickets and scurvy are reaching alarming proportions. The famine fevers, typhus, cholera, typhoid and plague, are on the increase. Death rates from infectious disease are rising everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He further predicted that famines may develop more devastating than the world has ever seen, and, at the war’s end 500,000,000 people would be short of food, “many millions desperately so.” Former Governor Lehman of New York, in his article for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American Magazine</span><span class="font6"> (September), disclosed that “540,-000,000 in Axis-occupied countries are looking to the United Nations for aid”. (“Can We Let Them Starve T by Herbert H. Lehman) In Europe alone he lists Albania, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, besides our allies. For some years after the war, Lehman suggests, Americans must continue the ration system if mass starvation abroad is to be averted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pestilence of Influenza</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Famine and Pestilence are on the rampage! The conditions now call to ' mind the events of the past war which brought influenza, pneumonia and shortness of bread. Students of history will also recall the terrible Black plague, or fever of Levant, which is said to have killed 25,000,000 in Europe alone during the 14th century. The latter, or bubonic plague, is the most destructive of any known form of epidemic, the mortality sometimes reaching 100 percent. With this in mind the recent efforts of Japanese to spread this disease among the American armed forces in the South Seas through inoculated rice dropped by planes in areas where the carrier rat was prevalent indicate a new low in depravity.. The plague still rages in China, India, and many other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is also known as the Black Death because of the discoloration of the skin which characterizes the disease. Buboes (whence the name “bubonic”), or swellings in the glands of the neck or groin, often developing into carbuncles, chills and fever, constipation alternating with diarrhea, and intense thirst, were the usual symptoms, while hemorrhages from the bowels, stomach, lungs, and nose frequently occurred. Such a fearful malady sometimes brought death in twenty-four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Influenza is again making a strong appearance with varied complications. This term is derived from the Italian &quot;influenza di freddo”, meaning &quot;effect of a cold”. The similar term “grip” is of French origin. While the greatest epidemic of the disease probably occurred in 1918-19, it is said to have been prevalent centuries before, though called by another name. The epidemic of 412 described by Livy is skid to have been influenza. In the past fifty years it has usually been given the name of the European country where first noted, as in 1890 it was called “Russian influenza”, and in 1918 “Spanish influenza”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While it is usually thought of in connection with a cold, and such is many times the case, yet it is a disease attacking almost any set of tissues. The pains in the bones, which are a frequent symptom, represent the effect of the disease on the blood-forming marrow’ of the flat bones. Deterioration of the blood causes heart complications, which calls for rest. General supporting treatment is required, such as keeping the bowels open, and relieving the patient’s mind of all anxiety or mental burdens. While influenza is said to attack a larger proportion of the population than any other, it is usually fatal only when pneumonia sets in. Infants are almost immune and those bet’ween the ages of 20 and 40 are generally stricken. General health, outdoor air, and sunshine, are the best antidotes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Another Fatal Enemy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another fatal enemy of long standing, syphilis, is taking increased toll today. It is not so fast, often taking many years to kill, but is more dreaded because of the dishonorable implications, although it may be contracted innocently enough. Of particular significance is its increase among young girls and in the United States army, as reported by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reader's Digest,</span><span class="font6"> Here again is remarked the failure of educational institutions such as schools and churches, endowed for the professed purpose of instructing and uplifting the nation’s youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Child delinquency is causing national concern. Among its most serious features is the increase of venereal disease, taking its toll even on the unborn. One cause of this retrograde course is found in the deviation from righteousness by the asserted bulwarks of morality, the schools and religious institutions. Preachments have little value to the child when the examples of his elders are not in keeping. There is also an increasing tendency to shirk all responsibility as to children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For instance, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Readers Digest</span><span class="font6"> finds that many families working on “swing shift” send their children out in the town’s streets at night so they will sleep late and not wmken parents taking their rest during the day. The article condensed from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Common Sense</span><span class="font6"> entitled “Trouble on the Street Corners” reveals a condition w’hich has hardly been suspected by the severest critics of modern youth. While a year ago 75 percent of the venereal disease in the armed forces could be traced to professional prostitutes, today 80 percent comes from young girls and amateurs. “Girls of 14, 15 and 16 are paying the biggest price,” says Doctor Janet Nelson of the USO. A post surgeon of a large midwestern air base says: “Good-time girls of high school age are the army’s biggest problem today as a potential source of venereal disease.” Nor is this danger confined to the needy families, but is becoming prevalent among officers and girls of the socially prominent. “The foundations of American family life are being threatened as never before,” says one delinquency expert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another kind of “health” item is parenthetically inserted here: “How&quot; to Dodge a Bomb.” Perhaps all the discoveries of science may not be as important to us on some occasion as practical information to be instantly followed on the above. Captain Reade Tillay, back from the Mediterranean island of Malta, wdiich has been bombed so frequently by the Nazis, although catacombed with air-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">raid shelters, gives this timely advice: Determine whether the bomb is heading for you by sighting up at it with $rm extended while holding' a lead pencil or . stick to sight at the bomb, holding the stick or pencil steady. If the bomb appears away from your sight, moving * to right or left or over it, then it is t headed elsewhere. If, however, it disappears behind or is masked by your pencil or stick it is falling in line with you, either in front or exactly where you stand. In that case, he advised moving in any direction except forward, &quot;sort of quick.” The quotation appears to be art example of English understatement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief instigators of this “disease” are the Nazis, and, while on the subject of science, it is noteworthy that several eminent authorities repudiate the “master race” theory advanced by the Germans to extenuate military butcheries. Says Doctor Boas: “I believe that the present state of our knowledge justifies us to say that, while individuals differ, biological differences between races are small.” Doctor Boas, who died last year, German and lifelong champion of intellectual freedom, was one of the first proscribed authors when the Nazis came into po^ver in 1933. They promptly burned his books dowm to the last pamphlet. (Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font6"> December 23, 1943) Doctor Irving Langmuir, director of the General Electric Research Laboratory, concedes reasonably that “science has limits”; and that German aggressions cannot be excused on their asserted need for expansion, for fuller development of the “master race”. He found “no proof that general causes are dominant over individual acts. ... A recognition of right and wrong, even if these concepts are sometimes fuzzy, has proved to be of incalculable value to mankind. The philosophical, metaphysical or even scientific analysis of the principles of ethics has not proved particularly fruitful.” (New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font6">December 27, 1942)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the fight for life science has investigated light rays and heat. The study of electrons and the cosmic ray, which remains, as yet unexplained, has brought forth a giant X-ray machine, of 100 . million volts, which is about a hundred times as powerful as those in most hospitals, still futilely used to discover the cause of cancer. No certain cure is known, and in that respect 1943 is no different from other years, as far as producing a remedy is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Famine and Malnutrition</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since malnutritiop is one of the major causes of disease, and war brings both the destruction and reduction of food supplies, together with tremendous difficulties of distribution and transportation, the nations are confronted with this painful perplexity. Erom local observations it seems that the American victory garden is producing much better than reckoned by the skeptical farmer, who observed the young lady in attractive overalls marking each ro^v not only with the name of the vegetable, but also w’ith the ration-point rating, “to make hoeing easier.” Many markets sell less summer vegetables than before the war, due to home production. Americans are unquestionably interested in eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the giant bomber has developed the giant cargo plane, now made the food carrier. While an average 10,000-ton ship can carry possibly a thousand times as much as even a large cargo plane, as far as tonnage is concerned, yet the plane has advantages in speed and access to points on both land and sea. No convoy of warships and destroyers is required. In addition to these advantages, food is not only dehydrated but also compressed, in order to compensate for some of the limitations in maximum plane tonnage. Doctor North, Manhattan milk expert, has perfected a process of milk dehydration by which the “reconstituted” milk is “indistinguishable from fresh whole milk in appearance, taste and chemical content”. “Dehydration of milk is done in one of two ways: (1) spraying the milk into hot air chambers; (2) drying it in thick films on heated rollers.” In the North process the milk and butterfat are dehydrated at different temperatures, milk below 159 degrees and butterfat milk and butterfat at 185 degrees Fahrenheit. Both dehydrates will keep for two years at any temperature if packed in sterile containers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Time,</span><span class="font6"> November 16, 1942)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A government agency is now compressing many dehydrated foods so as to pack more in smaller space. Compression squeezes out not only water but also air. Thus ten tons of raw food are reduced to one, with an improvement in keeping qualities. At a recent luncheon given in Washington to commemorate the passage of the Lend-Lease Bill, and attended by Cabinet members, Congressmen and representatives of England, Bussia, China and other foreign nations, included in the menu were puree of soybean soup, meat loaf, mashed potatoes, carrots, beet salad, and custard pie,, all made from dehydrated products and “freshened” by adding water before cooking or heating. In the compression process each type of food is given particular attention. After dehydration some varieties are quick-frozen to as low as 20 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, while the pressures range from 250 to 2,500 pounds, depending on the product. Foods are then turned out in cakes, each wrapped in cellophane to seal out air and moisture. It thus results that a package no larger than a shoe-box contains enough compressed, dehydrated potatoes to serve 100 men; a 14-pound package of eggs processed in this manner contains the equivalent of 537 fresh ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One giant dehydration plant is located in Caldwell, Idaho. It is expected that this plant will turn out twenty million pounds of dried potatoes, and two million pounds of dried onions, in 1943. “In the dehydrating process, the tubers are peeled, shredded, given a steam or hot-water blanching and dried in air-heated tunnels, then packed in this shrunken state into five-gallon tins.” (Los Angeles </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner,</span><span class="font6"> August 1, 1943)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Famine of Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With what efficacy these devices may be used to relieve the food shortage is not yet known. But a more serious famine, “not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord,” the nations of “Christendom” make no effort to abate. (Amos 8:11) They hate God’s servants who call attention to the life-sustaining truths of the Bible, and, while claiming God’s name, yet ignore His admonition delivered by the Great Expounder of His Word, Christ Jesus: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro-ceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4; Jeremiah 25: 29, 31; Bevela-tion 18: 8) God alone is able to provide abundantly for all the peoples of earth, and that He will do for all the inhabitants of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Earthquakes in Divers Places”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In His prophecy above referred to Jesus foretold earthquakes as one of the signs of the end of Satan’s world. (Matthew 24:7) The most devastating earthquakes in history have stricken many parts of the world since the turning point in human affairs marked by the year 1914. The most destructive on record occurred in Tokyo, in 1923, taking a toll of nearly 100,000 lives and causing property damage of $4,500,000,000. Some will remember with regret the quantities of American sympathy and dollars lavished upon treacherous Tokyo. No doubt when her hour of need comes again there will be none to lament.—Jeremiah 25: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One authority forecasts another great earthquake for Japan in the near future. His calculations are based on the past recurrence of earthquakes in that area, which show that the Oriental back-stabbers have had an average of one</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">severe series of shocks or temblors every eight years. “Of the 56 greatest earthquakes of the world that have occurred since recording of earthquakes began some forty years ago, five have - occurred in Japan—an average of one every eight years. The Japanese themselves, in their official records for the <sub>t</sub> years 1905-1935, list 19 quakes as severe, i an average of a severe quake every eighteen months. Since the last major earthquake in Japan occurred in 1933, the seismologist [specialist in the study of earthquakes and attending phenomena] reasons that, according to the law of averages, Japan should not be far from another serious earthquake.” (Altoona </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mirror<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font6"> March 1, 1943)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scores of Earthquakes Yearly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than sixty world-shaking earthquakes occur each year. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{The Encyclopedia Americana)</span><span class="font6"> The nature of earthquake movement is not a simple pendulum motion (horizontal motion) nor a simple up-and-down movement (vertical movement), but most often a combination of both of these with additional twisting and tilting movements occurring simultaneously. The double amplitude of the vibration, or distance traversed by the moving earth crust, is usually less than four thousandths of an inch, but one such record vibration reached almost three inches. The velocity of such movement varies from a few feet to five miles per second, as in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Such vibratory waves go around the world, decreasing in intensity as they move farther from the focal point. In soft ground waves a foot high are sometimes produced. Due, however, to the small fraction of an inch of motion usually occurring, structures on firm foundations are generally not injured, as witness the Imperial hotel in Tokyo, built by an American architect as earthquakeproof, and which withstood the devastating shocks of 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Earthquakes may occur near the sur-22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">face or at a depth as great as 450 miles, if the calculations of the seismologist are correct. They are also divided into two classes, volcanic and tectonic, the latter meaning a motion or movement of earth structure, which may be dissociated from volcanic eruption. The most devastating are of this tectonic type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Results of Earthquakes ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besides the wrecking of utility lines and mains, such as sewerage, water, gas and electricity, often bringing terrible fires, as in San Francisco, with attendant loss of life, aiid tumbling structures and dwellings, also great earth cracks, and geological displacements called “faults” or “slips”, and “seismic sea waves” are produced. In 1891 the main island of Japan was practically broken in two, cracks being observed clear across the island from the Japan sea on the west to the Pacific ocean on the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The earthquake in Long Beach, California, a few years ago brought natural oil to the surface, -which had not been previously discovered in that area, according to residents of that city. The seismic sea wave is popularly called the “tidal” wave. This is produced by the submarine earthquake, and generally occurs as follows: A half hour after an earthquake, the waters along the shore of the area affected may slowly ebb, sometimes leaving ships aground; then about half an hour later the water returns, in a great wave, sometimes reaching the height of 90 feet in the shoal waters. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font6"> says this is caused by the waters first rushing into a depression on the floor of the sea, wdiich had been formed by the earthquake, then the inrushing waters forming a ridge above the hole or depression and returning in a mighty wave, which increases in height as it moves shoreward, &quot;where the water is ordinatily shallower. Such waves are often more destructive than the earthquake. After the Arica (Chile) earthquake of 1868, and that of Iquique</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font6">in 1877, it is said that the sea continued to oscillate by oncoming and receding tidal waves for two days. Meanwhile the waves were sent around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further on the result of earthquakes, the article by David Dietz, written for the Scripps-Howard newspapers (March 16, 1943), is of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More strange, terrifying and - spectacular occurrences probably are connected with earthquakes than with any other natural phenomena. Residents of the Cleveland-Buffalo and other regions who are startled by recent earth tremors would do well to reflect that their experience was very mild indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Islands have appeared and disappeared as the results of earthquakes. Lakes have been created and destroyed. The courses of rivers have been changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reelfoot Lake, 18 miles long and three miles wide, and the only large natural lake in Tennessee, occupies a depression in the ground, created by the earthquake of 1811. That earthquake is more frequently referred to in scientific literature as the New Madrid (Mo.) earthquake. During it fountains of water shot up out of the ground as high as the treetops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earthquakes which occur on the ocean bottom are frequently followed by great tidal waves. Some of these have done vast damage to coastal shipping and cost many lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Great Earthquakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other great earthquakes include the following: Lisbon, Portugal, 1755, which destroyed the city and is said to have exposed quicklime pits under certain churches for the disposal of unwanted infants; San Francisco, 1906, above referred to; Messina, Sicily, 1908, 77,283 lives lost; Central Italy in 1915, causing 30,000 deaths; Kansu, China, in 1920, 100,000-200,000 lives lost; in Japan the great Tokyo quake occurred in 1923; another taking 3,000 lives, striking the island of Sanriku, came in 1933; while in 1935 Formosa was stricken, with a casualty list of 4,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last great earthquake struck</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Turkey in June 1943. Although upward of 20,000 people were estimated killed in this catastrophe striking Adapazar and Hendek, which Turkish cities were almost wiped out, killings are so common in Europe, this dispatch only made the second page of some papers. The Associated Press dispatch of June 21 (1943) stated: “A violent earthquake in Turkey was reported today by the Berlin radio, which said half of the 30,000 persons in the city of Adapazar alone were reported killed by a.shock that extended over the northwest of the peninsula of Anatolia [between the Black and Mediterranean seas] . . . Less than 10 percent of Ada-pazar’s 2,480 dwellings are habitable, one broadcast said.... Official estimates reported also that in near-by Hendek about half of the city’s structures were wrecked. . . . The reports said that the ruins of Adapazar still were being searched for victims. The town’s main street, where government buildings aye situated, was almost wiped out, while the municipal electricity system was destroyed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Exodus 19:18 it is recorded of Mount Sinai in ancient times that “the smoke thereof ascended as. the smoke of a furnace, and the whole- mount quaked greatly” when “the Lord descended upon it in fire”, and later gave the children of Israel the ten commandments through Moses. Again, God caused the earth to open and swallow -the rebels against Moses; but whether this was attended by an earthquake the Scriptures do not reveal. (Numbers 16: 27-34) When Jona- ’ than assaulted a Philistine garrison, the Lord caused the earth under the enemy host to quake. (1 Samuel 14:15) When Jesus died upon the tree “the veil of the -temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent”. (Matthew 27:51) Also note Ezekiel 38:20. It is thus evident that God does on occasion cause earthquakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand, are many earth-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">quakes merely the result of natural causes? Can the causes be explained? Again man has been unable to solve this problem. While it is known that a movement in the earth’s crust at the center or focus of the quake causes the vibrations, it is not known what induces this j movement. Earth sections may slip, slide, t tilt, twist, or heave above one another, particularly where there are “faults” or bre'aks in the rock layers. For example, the San Andreas fault moved on one side a horizontal distance of seven to twenty-one feet, at various places, and a vertical distance of one to three feet, which is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">-said to have started the San Francisco earthquake of April 18,1906. These earth movements produce vibrations which take the form of waves emanating from the source or focus similar to the ripples produced by a rock cast into a still pool. Though most violent near the focus, these waves are reflected around the. earth, becoming gradually fainter and slower as they recede. Major earthquakes are thus recorded by seismographs, which delicate instruments pick up the least tremor throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Last Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Earthquakes are said to be associated with mountain building, and are most frequent along coastal mountain ranges, such as in Japan, Chile, Italy, and California. The stresses and strains, changes in temperature and pressure, to, which different sections of the earth’s crust are subjected, &quot;have been offered as reasons for the phenomena. More particularly the action of steam pressure from boiling sea water, which has seeped through some crevice in the ocean floor to penetrate earth’s heated or molten interior, exerting almost irresistible force upon the solid matter, causing internal upheaval, has been advanced by one scientist, to explain the movement of earth’s crust. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{The Encyclopedia Americana) </span><span class="font6">This would hardly seem to account for the Missouri earthquake in 1811. A longstanding explanation has been to the effect that the earth was formed by a mass thrown off the sun, still remained in a hot liquid state within, and the cooling of the outer crust caused wrinkles and cracks. Doubt is now raised as to whether the earth can be molten within, even though admittedly at a very high-temperature, because compressed by the weight of the material above it. (Dietz) On the other hand, a Dublin professor suggests that the radioactive material in the earth’s crust results in the accumulation of heat which melts the deep rock layers, thereby initiating the crustal movement. All that can be said for certain is, Man does not understand the cause of earthquakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of their occurrences, on the other hand, millions can testify. The important conclusion to be reached is that Jehovah permitted such phenomena to come to pass today, that the prophecy He gave through Jesus might be fulfilled. Since the Lord foretold them no man can avert them. (Isaiah 55:11) For the wise the famine, the pestilence, the earthquakes, together with the other events listed by Jesus as marking the end of the world of Satan, serve as a warning bell to flee to The Theocracy. In the same prophecy Jehovah foretold that a greater catastrophe, Armageddon, would follow these “signs”. (Matthew </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">24:</span><span class="font6">21) Life in the New World awaits the refugee to the Kingdom of God, wherein none of these, evils shall occur.—Bevelation 21:4; Nahum 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Briefly restated, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes were foretold by Jesus as “signs” marking the end of Satan’s world of wickedness and oppression. Such literal conditions and events have occurred since 1914 especially, baffling science either to explain or to counteract, According to Jesus’ words there is only one place of safety from all such destroyers, including God’s invisible hosts now arrayed for the last assault. The wise will seek that place of God’s favor, The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Helping Boys unto the Kingdom</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font6">Y ‘HUNTING and fishing’ assignment is at Wellston, Ohio. The things I have experienced during the past nine months, though sometimes unpleasant, have made me grateful beyond words that I have been permitted to have this privilege of service. At our assignment we met with much demonized opposition, and before our first month had passed my partner and I had been arrested three times, cursed and threatened, in an attempt to bluff us out. Our trailer was turned completely over, and other acts by hoodlums were committed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Feeling sure that the only way to bear our burden properly before the Lord was to remain at our post and continue to hold high the standard of the only light, The Theocracy, we refused to be moved. The witness work for the next few months was in many ways discouraging, but the unusual experiences we’ve had with the young boys of the town have caused us to thank Jehovah that He kept the way open for us to remain there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after our arrest about a dozen boys came to, us and requested to hear a record, stating that they had discussed us in their civics class and wanted to hear our side of the matter. One of them showed unusual friendliness, and, although a Catholic, evidenced a very favorable spirit through the period of time when the officials were doing everything they could to run us out of town. In return for his favors I made him a gift of a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then about two months ago my partner and I were awakened at three o'clock in the morning by several large rocks being thrown at the trailer, one of them going through the screen door. The attackers quickly drove away and later came back the second time, left, and came back a third time. However, this time we were waiting for them and cornered them. Imagine my surprise to find that one of the boys was the boy who had shown such a friendly attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I was quite angry at such a display of bad conduct, and proceeded to give them a rather severe talk on the subject of good citizenship and true Americanism and what constitutes a true Christian. They tried to put up an argument in defense of their conduct, but the knowledge the “sword of the spirit” imparts was far superior to their parochial-school education and eventually they remained silent and listened attentively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I finished, one of the boys who had been satisfied to keep quiet and listen the entire time spoke up and said, “Are there any of your pamphlets that will briefly sum up your belief! I would certainly like to read one of them.” Whereupon I gave them each a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font6"> booklet. As they left they said, “We will come back again, and next time we’ll bring our Bibles along,” And sure enough, they did come back again with several others and listened to some records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In fact, during the time we’ve been there there have been between fifty or sixty boys under twenty years of age who have come to our trailer to hear records, ask questions, and, usually, leave with a booklet in their possession. The officials have long realized that the best course for them to take is to maintain silence and let us do our work in peace.—Raymond Franz, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Distributing Secret Newspapers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ There are many secret newspapers in Europe, and millions of copies of some of them are printed in England. Printed on high-speed rotary presses, the papers are automatically folded and counted and -packed into bricks of 500. From the print-shop they go to the planes, which drop them in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. To be caught with one of these newspapers brings severe punishment. The papers are, nevertheless, widely read.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Religion the Curse of India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE politicians and others who think that what the world needs is more religion should take a little time off to study about India, that great country . equaling in size all of the United States least of the Rocky mountains, and containing more than 70 percent of all the people in the British Empire,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How many people realize that the population of India is greater than the total population of North America, Africa and Oceania put together? Yet such is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The continents just named are crisscrossed with enough kinds of religion to suit most people. In the United States alone are 210 different kinds of professed Christians; so there is seemingly no lack of variety in North America. Africa and Oceania add scores of millions of Mohammedans and an assortment of forms of demonism of which North America knows little or nothing; and the less it knows, the better off it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But it isn't till you get to India that you-see religion in all,its bloom. ‘And a more devilish plant never flowered. If you say it in a hurry you condense the figures and explain that India has 239,195,140 Hindus. You would like to hurry on from this to mention that there are 77,677,545 Moslems, 12,786,806 Bud-dhjsts, 8,280,347 tribalists, 6,296,763 “Christians” (of the 210 varieties met in the United States, and some more local ones of other varieties), 4,335,731 Sikhs, 1,252,105 Jains, 109,752 Zoroastrians, and 24,141 Jews. And then you would like to drop the whole subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But you can’t drop it. The 239,195,140 Hindus have all one religion, don’t they 1 Yes indeed. But they are split up into 2,400 castes, and each caste is a religion . in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Suppose that you were born a Hindu. ’ You would find yourself automatically a member of any one of 45 races speaking any one of 200 languages, and you would land automatically in one of the 2,400 castes. Maybe you would be one of the 60,000,000 Untouchables. That is almost half as many people as there are in the United States. That ought to interest you. All right, then; you are an Untouchable. Here is your religious inheritance. You received it with your mother’s milk, like the Roman Catholics do “Purgatory” and the Protestants “eternal torture”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only it is worse. Very thoughtfully,the Roman Catholics shove “Purgatory” off into the'future, and the Protestants do the same with “eternal torture”. That gives both of them a break. They can at least have some fun in this life before they hit the toboggan and slide into the kettle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But no such luck for you, O Untouchable friend. You are out of luck from the minute you are weaned. Maybe after that you would occasionally like to eat, but nobody will sell you any land; nor will anybody buy any eatables from you, even if you had them to sell. You might like to wash your clothing or even yourself, but there is no place except the village well and an Untouchable may not thus contaminate the water that flows from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only jobs you can get are those that no others would have. You may be permitted to empty the night vessels of some of those of the other 2,399 castes, and in return therefor be given a chance to fill yourself partly with the garbage which is left in convenient juxtaposition therewith. But it is your religion. Don’t forget that. And remember that what the world needs is more religion (?).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It might be that you would feel that some of the other castes have not treated you as they should. Very well; the regular courts won’t deal with you at all, and the police will side against you because you were not born with the right religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of India sorely need the truth of The Theocracy, and Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing it to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spelling</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">EHOVAH GOD has purposed that a great educational campaign be carried' on among the people, a campaign of education in the most vital field of all, namely, the worship of Almighty God. The Bible, is the basic textbook, but to assist the people in gaining an understanding of its contents Bible helps have been provided, foremost among these being the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine. That magazine has expressed the possibility that the Theocratic educators may have to teach some of the people to read and write, especially in clergy-dominated lands where priestcraft has kept the masses in ignorance. To write, one/inust know how to spell. Many persons misspell comparatively common words, which spelling faults can be overcome by giving adittle attention to the subject. So let us examine the problem of spelling, not so much with the idea of becoming perfect spellers, but to try to improve our spelling to some extent and eliminate the more glaring errors. There are several definite, systematic steps that can be taken toward this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Modern English spelling is rather complex and oftentimes inconsistent, due to many causes. The Anglo-Saxon literary tradition was destroyed by the Norman Conquest, with the result that a written language was created that was fundamentally English, but was spelled by French scribes. Many foreign words have been introduced, which retain the spelling and pronunciation of the language of origin. Writers and printers have been indifferent toward consistency </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">always spelling the same sound the same way. Pronunciation of words changes, and sometimes this produces a change in spelling, and sometimes not. Words are not always spelled as they sound. A fundamental difficulty is that no alphabet has been adopted that provides one character, and only one, for each of the separate sounds of the English language. There are forty or more sounds in English, but there are only 26 characters in the alphabet to represent them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are there any aids or guides for us as we try to overcome these difficulties'? Some, yes. Most persons who habitually misspell never see words clearly in the first place. They do not note the letters in the word, but allow their eye to slide rapidly through the line, seeing only words and phrases. Hence they have no mental image of how the correct arrangement of letters within the word should look. Others have this mental picture but it is vague. When they write the word, incorrectly spelled, they sense something is wrong; if doesn’t “look right”. But they aren’t sure as to how to correct it. So note the spelling of words as you read them. And when you write them, look up in the dictionary all those about whose spelling you are doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pronunciation can be a help, or a snare, depending upon whether the pronunciation is right or wrong. To illustrate: If one says pro-nun-ci-a-tion he will probably spell the second syllable correctly, n-u-n. On the other hand, if he incorrectly says pro-noun-ci-a-tion, he will likely err in spelling the second syllable, n-o-u-n. This is a common error. Some omit letters of a word when they speak, saying, for example, in-terpets, and as a result leave out the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font6"> in the last syllable. If, however, one correctly says in-ter-prets, he will not omit the r. Some omit entire syllables in pronouncing, with resultant errors in spelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are a great number of rules that serve as guides to correct spelling; and some of them will be mentioned, not with the expectation that you will remember them, but that you may be aware of their existence and usefulness, and learn them as, and if, you have the opportunity. Rules are dry and uninteresting^ and some have disconcerting exceptions; but they are of value nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s New International Dictionary,</span><span class="font6"> in the introductory-matter, has two and a half pages on orthography, which is the art of spelling and writing words correctly. There are 36 rules listed, and the most noteworthy exceptions are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here are some of the better-known rules:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consonants </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">f, I</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">s,</span><span class="font6"> at the end of monosyllables, and standing immediately after a single vowel, are generally doubled, as in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">staff, bell, grass, cliff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an important rule that will enable one to avoid a common dilemma; namely, do words like </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">offered, preferred, inferred,</span><span class="font6"> etc., have one or two </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r’s</span><span class="font6"> before the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ed?</span><span class="font6"> Here is the rule: When an ending beginning with a vowel is added to monosyllables or words accented on the last syllable, when these words end in a single consonant (except </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">x)</span><span class="font6"> and are preceded by a single vowel, that consonant is doubled. Examples _ are: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">planned, planning, abetted, beginner, beginning, inferred, inferring, preferred, preferring, occurred, occurring, occurrence.</span><span class="font6"> Now, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">offer</span><span class="font6"> the accent is on the first, not the last syllable; so </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">offered</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">offering</span><span class="font6"> have only one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r.</span><span class="font6"> The same is true of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">marveled, marveling,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">marvelous,</span><span class="font6"> only one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> being used. The Scriptures use a double </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> in the last-mentioned word, and double the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font6"> in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worshiped</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worshiping,</span><span class="font6"> though in harmony with this rule only one should be. used in modern writing. If the accent shifts its position, due to the change in the word, then the consonant is not doubled. For example, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">infer</span><span class="font6"> acquire a double </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font6"> when they become </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">preferred </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">inferred,</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">preferring</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">inferring.</span><span class="font6"> The accent Stays on the same syllable. But when </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prefer</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">infer</span><span class="font6"> become </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">preference</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">inference,</span><span class="font6"> with the accent moved to the first syllable, only the single </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font6"> is used. Incidentally, here again one notes the importance of knowing how to pronounce correctly; for if one does not know where the accent belongs, he cannot apply this <sub>(</sub>very helpful rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' Recall that the rule states that the ending added to a word must begin with a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">vowel,</span><span class="font6"> for the rule to apply. If a suffix beginning with a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">consonant</span><span class="font6"> is added to one of these words, the final consonant of the original word is not doubled. Accordingly, while </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fit</span><span class="font6"> when it becomes </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fitted</span><span class="font6"> acquires two </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t’s, fitness</span><span class="font6"> has only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another perplexing situation that confronts the average person when he has to spell words is this: When adding the suffix </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">able</span><span class="font6"> to words that end with a silent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font6"> does one retain or drop the letter e? It depends on the consonant just before the silent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font6"> If it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font6"> one retains the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font6"> writing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">peaceable, changeable,</span><span class="font6"> etc. But if any other consonant than </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">g </span><span class="font6">precedes the final, silent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font6"> the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font6"> is dropped. Thus we have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">usable, unmistakable, likable,</span><span class="font6"> etc. This same rule is expanded to cover the - disposition of these silent final </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e’s</span><span class="font6"> in all cases where a syllable or syllables are added; not only for the ending </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">able</span><span class="font6"> but also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ous, age, ful, ness, ment,</span><span class="font6"> etc. Generally, the silent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font6"> is dropped when the termination added begins with a vowel, and it is retained when the termination begins with a consonant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One last rule: The use of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ie</span><span class="font6"> or' </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ei. </span><span class="font6">When these two letters have the sound of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e, i</span><span class="font6"> is placed before </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font6"> except after </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">c: believe, receive.</span><span class="font6"> When it is not sounded as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font6"> the order is usually </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ei: reign, neighbor, weight.</span><span class="font6"> This, remember, like most of the other rules, has exceptions. But they are of tremendous assistance in avoiding errors in spelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the use of the dictionary, correct pronunciation, and rules, spelling bees are still an effective means of correcting faulty spelling. So, have a spelling bee with your roommate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus brief consideration has been given to the subject of spelling. The need of improvement has been shown, and its difficulties discussed. Four aids have been outlined; namely, the dictionary, pronunciation, rules, and the old-fashioned though still effective spelling bee. If you improve your spelling, it will require time and study and a conscious effort to spell correctly, an awareness of spelling. Any who wish to follow up the subject will, as previously stated, find much helpful information in the introductory matter of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Webster's New International Dictionary;</span><span class="font6"> and there are many other books, on grammar and composition, that offer many valuable suggestions and rules to aid one in coping with this problem of spelling correct-iy-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pries't Gets Excited in Vain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In Mobile, Alabama, an eight-year-old publisher was presenting to the public, on Mis assigned corner, a certain issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> magazine. A robust priest, seeing him, craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the headlines and then called the boy to him. The boy, not hearing, kept walking around the people, showung the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest came up to the boy, and in a smooth voice said, “Boy, what is this? How much is it? And who are you selling them for?” The publisher showed him the magazine, explaining that it is published by Watchtower ; that he was not selling, but contributions were accepted to help publish more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After noting the title “Foreign Conspiracy, etc.” the priest’s manner ' changed, and trembling with rage he grabbed the young publisher by the shoulder and in a neat Irish brogue cried, “You come with me; you can’t sell that here in America.” The young man stood his ground, and at just the right moment the young man’s mother took him by the other arm (she also is a Theocracy publisher), telling him not to move or go anywhere with the priest. The priest then said, “Oh yes, he will; w’hen I get an officer he will.” &quot;Oh no, he won’t,” said the mother, “or with an officer either, unless he is under arrest.” The priest then walked to the traffic cop, opening the magazine and showing contents, and tried to have the policeman arrest the boy. The policeman laughed, shook his head, and handed the magazine back to the priest. The publisher meantime calmly went on with his work, placing more magazines with interested bystanders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest then, with the magazine still in his hand, fairly flew up the street, where he chanced to overtake another publisher, a lady, also offering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> This was too much for Hrin, and with the veins in his neck fairly bursting he called the police, who came and asked, “What is it?” Shaking his finger at the worker, the priest said, “Take her in; get her off the streets.” “I can’t do that; I’m a traffic cop,” said the custodian of public order, and walked back to his post. The priest left in a fury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘God Asks Us to Answer the Groans’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In an address at the Palmer House, Chicago, Archbishop Stritch, of that city, made the statement, “God now asks us to answer those cries and groans of people everywhere to bring them a better day.” Now, for instance, twelve days before he made that speech, there was a dispatch from Springfield, Ill., that Henry Bering (or Bernstein), of Stritch’s own state, would have to go to Iowa on the charge of “persuading the Rt. Rev. Msgr. John M. Molloy, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to invest money in whisky of the United Bottling &amp;&nbsp;Distributing Co. in return for allegedly valueless warehouse receipts”. It’s plain enough that Molloy wanted to get hold of some of that ‘Tetter day”, and get it down deep in his pants pocket, that is to say, his skirt pocket, but Bering (or Bernstein) went and stung him on the deal, and now Stritch’s bishop is groaning so you can hear him across five states. So the lawyers are rushing to save Molloy’s $2,570 and to quiet his groans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Have a foretaste of the outstanding statements in this book by reading the following selection taken from it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Political and religious promises to build a new and finer and free world by men’s hands are therefore ridiculous and presumptuous. They prove that the promisers forget God and hold his Word as untrue. But it will be their so-called ’new order<sup>1</sup> that will pass away at Armageddon, and God’s Word will stand vindicated as true. The new world of righteousness will be fashioned by Almighty God through His Master Workman, The Word, Christ Jesus. . . . Faithful men of old will rule in judgment on the earth under the Kingdom. . . . When put in official position on earth, they will as the King’s sons be ‘princes’ visible to humankind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Totalitarian Monstrosity Rebuked </span><span class="font7">j ♦ To me it is a monstrous thing that ! in any American community the right of children to public school education should be made dependent upon such a thing as a salute to the flag. That right is theirs by reason of citizenship. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The </span><span class="font7">country and its institutions exist for the people, not the people for the institu-'tions.&quot; That the people exist for the state is a totalitarian notion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flag salute was injected into the schools by busybodies and its adoption seems to have coincided with the decadence of the teaching of American history, a decadence which has been the subject of recent editorials in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">HeraldNews. As</span><span class="font7"> the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> has said in its long campaign against encroachments in Central Park, that if every structure which busybodies had wished to erect there had been built there would be no park; so with the public schools, if all the notions of busybodies were injected into them there would be no education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Jehovah’s witnesses refused to salute the flag in order to show defiance of the nation’s Constitution and laws and in support of some foreign power there might be some reason for all the judicial fuss. But they do not; theirs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">a religious attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Freedom, including religious freedom, is so precious, and should be so close to the heart of every American, that we should rather lean over backward to sustain it than to have it encroached upon in the slightest degree. Rather than have one child driven from the public schools for declining to salute the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">flag </span><span class="font7">in contravention of his conscience I would prefer to take that compulsory ritual out of the schools. After all, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Amer</span><span class="font7">ica got along very well without it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for a </span><span class="font7">century and a half.—Russell Palmer, in the Passaic (N.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman Catholic Hierarchy and Axis Collaboration</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Roman Catholic Church blesses the arms&quot; of the dictators, and gives thanks for their victories. She goes even farther. She takes her position in the ranks of the totalitarian forces as an integral part of the war machine. Her job is to prepare the way by manning the fifth-column activities, and her priests then consolidate the gains in the wake of the conquering Fascist legions and prevent uprisings of the Catholic occupied countries. Since their organization the Jesuits have been foremost in the fifth-column infdtrations and backstabbings. The Jesuits have, because of these seditious traits, been run out of many countries, only<sup>7</sup> to return later and repeat the performance. Instead of their becoming dizzy by this “revolving door” existence, the practice has only resulted in a closer approach to perfection in the nefarious work of their father the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy’s hand in this respect was exposed more in Spain than anywhere else. Throughout the recent civil war there this was obvious and the pope’s blessing of Franco, the “Christian gentleman”, would of necessity include his two cat’s-paws, Hitler and Mussolini, used to rake the papal chestnuts from the Spanish fire. Now the pope is further embarrassed by the dead giveaway<sup>7</sup> of his Fascist connections by Franco’s plans, recently publicized in the press, for a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font7"> axis against the democracies, consisting of Vichy France, Spain, and Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Spanish Falange is a notoriously Fascist organization; it is also Catholic. The bishop of Madrid is the director of the youth front of the Falange. Speaking to the leaders of this youth front the bishop, “Reverend” Leopoldo Eijo y Garay<sup>7</sup>, said: “Falange would not have raised you to the dignity of instructors of Spanish youth unless you were found to be good Catholics; and you would not be good Catholics if you ignored the saving social. doctrines of the church.” The bishop quoted the founder of the Falange as follows: “Man must be free, but liberty exists only<sup>7</sup> within a determined order.” Incidentally, this is similar to the sophistry<sup>7</sup> of the majority<sup>7</sup> opinion of the United States Supreme Court, rendered on June 8, 1942, against Jehovah’s witnesses, that ‘the mind of man remains forever free, but he must have a license to preach the gospel’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dictator of Spain had two diplomatic receptions at New<sup>7</sup> Year’s. To avoid embarrassment he had the friends of the Axis at one of them and the friends of the United Nations at the other. The representatives of Eire and of the Vatican w<sup>7</sup>erc at the Axis reception. Six weeks later the Vatican telegraphed the abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Montserrat to bless the Butcher; which he did.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Perhaps the reader would like to view the fifth column work nearer home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a meeting of the governors of the Pacific coast states of Mexico held at Mazatlan, Governor Gonzalez, of Jalisco, stated that the clergy in his state was carrying on a ridiculous. campaign against Mexican efforts to organize</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">national defense, telling the people “they should be on the side of Germany and Japan because those countries represent the religious interest of the world”. When' Mexico’s archbishop, Luis M. Martinez, denied the charges, the Jalisco legislature, the local branches of the Mexican Confederation of Workers, the ^League of Agrarian and Peasant Syndicates, and the Federation of Leagues of the People’s Sector supported the governor’s charges, declaring that “the activities of the National Synarchist union and National Action unquestionably follow the tactics pointed out for them by ecclesiastical authorities”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Los Angeles </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> November 9, 1941, contained a story stating that the Synarchists (elsewhere described as “Mexico’s gold-shirted legions”) are “ardent Catholics”, “claim 500,000 members and few deny their claim” and that “the power potentially commanded by the Sinarquistas [Synarchists] is formidable when one realizes the Mexican army numbers only 61,500 men”. And the Synarchists demand “restoration of full liberty for the Catholic Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was found necessary to outlaw a Catholic weekly in Costa Rica because of its love of Nazism and the “new order”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The president has ordered the suspension of the pro-Nazi Catholic weekly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Epoca</span><span class="font7"> under the extraordinary powers granted to him by Congress. The action, based upon the fact he considered the weekly an organ of the Nazis, Fascists and Falangists, meets with the general approval of the public and press. —New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Timex,</span><span class="font7"> March 9, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only the most expert of liars could be backing Hitler and Hirohito tooth and nail to gain world domination, and at the same thne pretend to the democracies that he is wholly on the side of .freedom. The conference of the republics.at Rio de Janeiro was prevented from gaining the end it had in view because Chile and Argentina, under control of the Vatican, refused to go along. Anticipating that some might suspect him of being at the bottom of their balky conduct the pope sent out a feeler, through his secretary of state and his delegate at Washington, denying that he had done anything to torpedo the conference. The joke is that nobody accused him of it. He denies everything as a matter of routine policy. He know<sup>T</sup>s he should be accused. (Chile has since broken diplomatic relations with the Axis.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In February of this year a well-knowm and responsible news commentator added to the voluminous evidence proving the collusion of the Vatican with Hitler in the present war. The statement broadcast was, in part, that “the Brazilian government has just seized a big supply of Nazi arms intended for a Nazi uprising. The arms were hidden in a church, the monastery of the German Franciscan Friars at Ceara.” This is all regular, but the plan slipped up. .The Brazilian government seized the arms and the Hierarchy denied that they ever existed. That was, of course, to be expected. Poor, persecuted church! The use of churches as centers from which to overthrow democratic governments is a long-established practice. Tn the betrayal of the Spanish Republic, the churches were the ‘arsenals of Fascism’.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Press Collaborates</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus -was accused of sedition, was innocent, and was crucified, ft has ever been the same with His sincere followers. But Barabbas, on the other hand, was accused of sedition and murder, was guilty, and yet was freed! So it is with the fifth-column Barabbas priests of the “Hol/’ Roman Catholic Church today. This advance army of Hitler and the pope infiltrates behind the enemy lines and does its deadly work, preparing the way before the mechanized hordes of the church’s “sword”, as it so effectively did in France. And the courageous, battling public press of America insipidly falls all over itself to feed soothing sop to these beskirted termites while they honeycomb democratic structures! If any other group or person has enough spine to present the obvious facts about their precious sacred cow, they belittle and ridicule and treat facetiously the evidence, calling them bigots, campaigners of hate, unneighborly, peculiar and unique. The unique thing would be if they could recognize a fact when they stumbled and fell over one, and, even more startling, then have the spunk to publish it. Under the lightly worded headline “H. G. Wells Pops Up with Unique Idea on the War&quot;, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Daily Tribune,</span><span class="font7"> August 31,1942, reported:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The present pope is in open alliance with the Japs,” he [Wells] wrote in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Dispatch,</span><span class="font7"> “and is the declared enemy of our ally.Russia. Why not a 2,000-pound bomb on the Vatican garden as a warning now? What mysterious influence or what diplomatic imbecility is it that prevents this clear and decisive action?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Rev. Dr. John C. Heenan, in a “Catholic Reply to Wells”, said that “with the exception of Jehovah’s witnesses, nobody now takes him [Wells] seriously when he talks about history or religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">H. G. Wells’ reputation as a historian is generally good and the publicity and circulation enjoyed by his books would tend to indicate many do take him seriously, far more so than do Jehovah’s witnesses. This so-called “reverend doctor”, Heenan, may be indulging in a little wishful thinking on this point. Typical of all Hierarchy rebuttal tactics, the facts presented are ignored, of necessity since they are true, and the man personally is attacked. But the press continues to grovel at the old lady’s feet. When the clandestine love of the Hierarchy for totalitarians shall have been fully exposed, as it surely will; when the darkness shall have given way to light; when even the dissipated press can see a truth; it will be amusing to see this brilliant press blinking stupidly in the unusual element called “light”. This belief of their ignorance is the kindest deduction from their attitude. If, on the other hand, they see the dark blight of Jesuit control twining its cruel lingers slowly about democracy’s throat, and tolerate and even aid its throttling work, then their traitorous course is most despicable. With the vast resources for gathering news at the disposal of the large newspapers, ignorance is really inconceivable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Protests” by Catholic Dignitaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But here, you say, if there is this collusion which the facts presented indicate, why do the Hierarchy spokesmen protest against the Nazis in Germany? Why is there so much persecution'of the church by the Nazis? To make anything approaching a complete consideration of this conspiracy, these questions must not be side-stepped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certainly there is a flood of alleged protests by Vatican representatives printed in the press at the present time. The protests are never clear-cut. They cannot be understood by the common people. The ordinary person is too busy or uninterested to ferret out the “vigorous protests” of such Hierarchy state-/ ments. But there is always an obliging papal-instructed reporter or editor to interpret the “courageous and bold” speech. According to the Catholic Church, the people are too dumb to read the Bible, although God tells them to ‘search the Scriptures and study to be approved of Him’. They say one must have a priest to interpret the Scriptures. Certainly a dexterous interpreter is required to bring to light from Vatican droolings any tangible protest against the dictators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> June 30, 1942, opens the account of such a dynamic protest against Nazism with the statement, “A sermon directly opposing Nazi state and social theories was read yesterday at St. Hedwig’s Church, Berlin, by the Catholic Bishop of the German capital, Count Konrad von Preysing.” The ‘direct opposition’ turned out to be a statement that the pope is praying day and night for peace and a better world, that it should be based on love, that you should not do unto others what you would not want others to do unto you, and that life is sacred, both of an unborn child and an old and decrepit man. Now doesn’t that blistering and scathing denunciation of Nazism make your skin tingle and incite your admiration for the courageous bishop? It doesn’t? Then you tmust let the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> interpret it; which It does as follows: “Thus the Bishop was indirectly criticizing the theories and practices of Nazi extremists who preach racial hygiene and euthanasia.” Now you see? Of course, the promise given by the introductory words about <sup>C</sup>direct’ opposition has dwindled to ‘indirect’; but don’t trouble your head about that: the newspapers will do your thinking for you. Incidentally, the bishop, in flowing red robes, arrived in a carriage drawn by two white horses and was met by enthusiastic “hails” for “our bishop”, three more cheers for “our holy father, Pope Pius XII”, and there were probably three more heils for Herr Hitler, the .third member of this trinity, but this, if reported, would take the edge off the story for the democracies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> also carried a story, on July 7, 1941, of a pastoral letter by the bishops in Germany in which they allegedly assailed the Nazis and stated that this was their first protest read from the pulpits since the start of the war. According to the account this unusual move “had a startling effect upon the faithful”. But they weren’t startled for long. The letter praised the soldiers, saying their achievements encouraged constant prayers in their behalf, described the war sacrifices made by the church in the interests of the German nation and that ‘the Catholic church in Germany is loyal to the government and gladly shouldered the burdens and sacrifices of the times’. If this had really ■ turned out to be a protest and thus continued startling the German Catholics unaccustomed to such action, one might ask why they waited until the war was two years old before deciding to object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much ado was made during May of last year about the blasting of the Nazis administered by Cardinal Faulhaber, archbishop of Munich, Part of the “protest” was, “Whoever complains that Peter’s throne does not stand on German soil does not know the history of God’s kingdom and ancient Germany.” This is in effect a statement that the papacy (Peter’s throne to the deceived Catholics, usurped) is standing in Germany as it did in the days of the “Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation”. He complained of the peaceless condition of the hearts of those of the Catholic religion in Germany. True Christians, regardless of trials, are not so troubled; for, “The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Philip-pians 4:7) This great ‘liberty-loving’ cardinal concluded with the following magnanimous prayer that should touch the hearts of the Protestant democra-' cies: “Today it is a question of life or death for Christianity, for in its blind rage against religion the Nazi ‘faith’ does not or cannot distinguish between Protestantism and Catholicism,” Thus he gives the tip-off to his true sentiments, that blind rage against Protestants is all O, K. and in harmony with the returning Middle Ages procedure, but that Catholicism should be spared. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-News,</span><span class="font7"> of Passaic, N. J., after reporting on this supposed denunciation of Nazism but in reality a condemnation of Protestantism, simpers on, “Remembering the fate of Pastor Nie-moeller and of thousands of Christian clergymen in Germany, Protestant and Catholic, we tremble for this great Archbishop of Munich. But the cardinal is not trembling. He will carry on. He is a brave man. He will meet death and not cringe! He is on God’s side!”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Freedom of Speech Only for Hierarchy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Niemoeller was a Protestant. He protested against the Nazis. He landed in a concentration camp. The Catholic dignitaries supposedly protest, are free to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font7">so, and remain free. Why? Also, why </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">it that as soon as Niemoeller decides to become a Catholic the gate to freedom begins to open for him? Catholic apologists needn’t waste breath denying this; for their own paper, the Altoona </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Register,</span><span class="font7"> says, “The International News service said it had word of the conversion on reliable authority. He may soon be released from the concentration camp as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">result of it.” Thus it may be seen why the cardinal is not trembling, and the gushing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-News</span><span class="font7"> may save its tremors for those that need them. The cardinal will carry on, with Catholic Hitler. He is on god’s side, which according to Catholic teaching means the pope, who in turn is in the Hitler clique. All are on the side of the god of this world, Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After discussing Niemocller’s position the Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font7"> October 27, 1941, said: “It is the adherents of the Bible Students’ sect (Ernest Bibelf or-scher), corresponding to Jehovah’s witnesses in this country, who have been persecuted for pacifism in concentration camps.” Jehovah’s witnesses continue to protest in Germany and are still in these camps. Niemoeller as a Protestant suffers ; as a Catholic, gets relief. The Catholic prelates have always been free to voice supposed protests. Why? Does the Nazi party fear public opinion if they took action against them? No; for they would just as soon murder whole towns, as Lidice, that uprise as they would one person. The fact is that the Hierarchy is in cahoots with the Nazis, and the “protests” are for democratic consumption and avidly swallowed by the majority of persons in such lands.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Whitewashing the Pope</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Here is a typical sample of the vigorous moral leadership Pope Pius XII is setting for the liberty-loving peoples of earth, accompanied, of necessity, with the interpretation thereof: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mussolini, this writer learned from reliable Vatican circles, suggested that the pope sanction what the Fascist press termed the “Christian crusade against the Russian atheists”. Pope Pius, however, refused to commit himself. [Now, wasn’t that courageous!] His silence showed more significantly than anything else up to that time the grave concern of the church over a possible Nazi victory in Europe. He has not, of course, come out openly in favor of an Anglo-American victory, for, in keeping with the traditional policy of the church, he must preserve at least a semblance of impartiality. But those who can read between the lines have now a clear idea of his attitude.—Kansas City </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font7"> June 8, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, Pius XII hasn’t come out openly for a United Nations victory. And those who can read between the lines without the aid of servile reporters and editors who read between lines as told to by the Vatican, or get no more news releases from there, can easily see he’s on the other side, with Catholic Hitler. The only reason that he attempts to maintain an outward appearance of impartial ity and even favoritism toward the democracies is to kid them into thinking he’s for them and hence desirable as a peace arbiter when the time for that comes. One Catholic paper says in apology for the Vatican’s failure to protest the bombing of civilians in Catalonia by Franco that it was necessary to avoid “any association to which a political character might be imputed”. Of course, there was no political partiality involved in papal blessings for Mussolini in Ethiopia and Franco in Spain and Japan against China. Now the pope shows conclusively his ‘fighting spirit for right’, not by refusing to bless the Russian crusade, but merely by his refusal to commit himself one way or the other. Isn’t that a thrilling rallying point for the oppressed peoples? Some of his henchmen are not silent, and doubtless speak with his approval. In Italy Archbishop Margotti called for a crusade against Bolshevism: “Italy has joined the anti-Bolshevik front with enthusiasm and faith of the ancient crusaders, proving that Italian soldiers are ready to give their blood generously for civilization’s victory against atheism and barbarism. Therefore, we also invite all good Catholics to raise insistent prayers to God to concede triumph to the new order and justice.” (New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily I News,</span><span class="font7"> July 21, 1941) Thus this high * church dignitary under the pope’s control not only goes &quot;all out” for the crusade in Russia but is also for the “triumph of the new order” advocated by the crusading Axis powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> June 25, 1941, said, “The German Catholic episcopate today sent to all dioceses a message describing the war against Russia as a battle for Christianity all over the world.” In Italy, Archbishop Margotti called for a crusade against Bolshevism: “Today we salute and bless the Italian legions who are marching with their allies in the common struggle to open the immense prison which encloses the Russian population.”—New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font7">July 21, 1941. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, outwardly the Vatican remains 'impartial’ but inwardly approves; 'appears piously beautiful outwardly, but within is full of dead men’s bones.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So perhaps in view of these statements the pope’s silence is not significant of his enmity toward the Fascist cause as so obligingly interpreted by a spineless press but rather that the generally accepted saying holds true here also, namely, 'Silence gives consent.’ In this same article praising his 'intrepid daring’ in maintaining silence it said that copies of his speeches &quot;advocating peace and a new world order sell by hundreds of thousands”. The “new order” is the Hitler-Pacelli revival of the old order of the “Holy Roman Empire”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vatican “protests” entirely fade out when contrasted with the course of Protestant ministers in Norway, and more so when compared with the unyielding integrity of Jehovah’s witnesses for the New World, or Theocracy, as maintained despite the Vatican-inspired persecution, against them in Germany. Go still further, and consider the/course of the great Fighter for the New World, Christ Jesus. No pope has ever denounced Nazism. Nor can anybody point to any encyclical or anything else that definitely shows his disapproval of the outfit now trying to seize control of the world. The most that can be shown is that on one occasion the pope said something that one or more reporters said was a reflection on Nazism. That was the way they interpreted the remark, and doubtless the way they were told to interpret it. But that is not the way Christ Jesus said things. If He had something to say He said it so that He could be understood the first time. When He called the clergy vipers, hypocrites, liars, thieves, and murderers, they understood whom He meant, and so did everybody else I (Matthew 23) Strange indeed if this straightforward Fighter for righteousness would use some ambiguous and pussyfooting pope as His “vicegerent”! They have nothing in common.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Persecution of Catholics in Germany</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">So much for “protests”. What about persecution of Catholics in Germany? This reported persecution is the greatest obstacle to many seeing clearly the true position of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Nazi party. Hitler and the Hierarchy may have a few lovers’ quarrels. But don’t fret; it’s nothing serious, yet. Here’s an analysis of Catholic persecution in the Third Reich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First, the Vatican and the Jesuits have always opposed liberalism and favored totalitarianism. There are many honest Catholics who desire freedom and democratic principles to prevail, but the Catholic Hierarchy feels differently. This liberal element of the Catholics of Germany formed the Catholic Centre Party, and was one of Hitler’s enemies in his rise to power. This bulwark against Nazism—-these liberal Catholics —was “sold out” and dissolved by order of Pope Pius XI, and Catholic Hitler surged into power <sup>as a</sup> result thereof, and a concordat was immediately concluded between Hitler and the one who put him into power. The leader of the liberal Catholic Centre Party, Klausener, was assassinated in the purge of June 30, 1934, and the Jesuit fear of infiltration of Protestant and liberal ideas into the German Catholic mind was quieted. Catholic social reformers within the church suffer its enmity as well as outside dangers to its absolute rule, and this is amply verified by the Reformation and the Inquisition. These liberal Catholics, therefore, are persecuted, and that with the full collaboration of the Vatican and the Jesuits to ‘cleanse’ the church, all under the guise of Nazi persecution. It is so capitalized upon in democracies to facilitate “fifth column” work therein by Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A catechism entitled “Brief and Simple Explanation of the Catholic Catechism”, by R, P. Angel Marcia de Arcos, S. J., distributed by hundreds of thousands of copies, says regarding liberalism and in proof of the foregoing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Q. Is there no grade of Liberalism which may be Catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A. That is what its partisans claim; but the church teaches that what is called Catholic Liberalism is not Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Q. Then there is no grade of Liberalism that can be good?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A. None; because Liberalism is mortal sin and anti-Christian in essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Q. Then whatever is liberal in politics sins?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A. Certainly; because in liberal polities there exists that liberalism which the Church condemns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Q. Then a Catholic must be anti-Liberal ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A. Without a doubt; exactly as he must be anti-Protestant or anti-Freemason; in short, against all the contraries to Christ and His Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So the Catholic Hierarchy serves two purposes in conniving with the Nazis in persecuting honest and liberal-minded Catholics in Germany: purges out of her own organization any decency and freedom, thus maintaining her cherished totalitarian corruptness, and capitalizes upon this self-inflicted persecution in the democracies for propaganda purposes. How the Devil must pride himself in the infamous duplicity of his favorite child.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Cumulative Evidence</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Add to all the foregoing testimony the following facts and the pile of evidence against papal Rome mounts and the case against her becomes conclusive: (1) The prosperity of the Cathohc church in Germany, and (2) her prosperity in the wake of the German armies in the occupied countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First, in Germany. In a statement in Rome Virginio Gayda, prominent Fascist, declared that “the Catholic churches, like the Protestant, are always open and full of people in German territory and carry on their functions undisturbed”. Corroborating this, the Seattle </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font7">November 16,1941, contains the information, forwarded from London by the United Press, that “Catholic churches are crowded as never before in Germany”. Four days later the Springfield </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Union,</span><span class="font7"> Springfield, Mass., contained the following excerpt from’ a personal letter by Mrs. Virginie Jourdan-Herbst, ’ Newtown, Conn., which speaks for itself: “More people attend ehurch with a real love in Germany than any other country I’ve been in. The German government supports the clergy, spending hundreds of millions annually for them, their palaces, convents, monasteries, schools, etc.” An Associated Press dispatch of March 7, 1941, says: “Catholic clergymen are taking religion to the German people by means of specially built automobiles equipped with altars. Notwithstanding the nation’s gasoline economy measures, German authorities approved the plan because the motorized churches are intended to serve scattered garrisons and isolated hamlets. The priests do their own chauffeuring.” If Germany were trying to stamp out Catholicism she would not supply priests with precious gasoline and automobiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Secondly, the occupied countries. Wherever the Nazi conquest prospers, the Hierarchy reaps benefits. In an interview with a London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald </span><span class="font7">reporter, the archduke Felix, brother of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* the pretender to the Austrian throne (Otto Habsburg), made the statement that the [Catholic] churches of Austria “were more full than ever they were -before; in fact, Catholicism seemed to be enjoying a revival in the country”. This same paper further said that the churches in Luxemburg are full, as is the case wherever the Pacelli-Hitler conspiracy has been fully carried out. The ’ same system of state payment of the clergy is used in Luxemburg as in Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vichy France is another glaring example of the reaping the spoils of war by the Vatican. The “good marshal” Petain has &quot;made financial grants to church schools of the primary grade”. The dispatch carrying this news says that the new laws &quot;give satisfaction to the Catholic Hierarchy”, which Hierarchy doubtless drafted them in the first place. The article continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Enactment of these laws was foreshadowed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font7"> last Wednesday. In effect they reverse one of the outstanding principles of the Third Republic, namely, that, while tolerated under certain conditions, church schools of the primary grade should receive no aid from the State. Conversely, there was every possible help for State schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">first of the three laws empowers pre</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fects </span><span class="font7">in each Department to grant subventions to church schools which otherwise might be compelled to close. The second establishes State inspection of church schools as regards both the health of the children and the instruction given them, but no inspector may enter any school unless accompanied by the headmaster or a duly accredited representative. The third authorizes the creation of “school funds” for church schools, which funds also may receive financial aid from the State. Hitherto “school funds” were authorized </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font7">for non-religious schools. The Petain </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">govern</span><span class="font7">ment having restored religion </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as a moral </span><span class="font7">value, it was but logical that the church should regain some of its privileges and that new ones should be granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A wireless from Vichy to the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> November 5, 1941, pertaining to this same matter, shows the flourishing condition of the Hierarchy now as contrasted with her former status in France, and testifies of the church’s support of the “new order&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the former regime church schools were not viewed with a tolerant eye by Cabinets which, to say the least, described themselves as non-religious. All their attention was turned to State schools, which were strictly “lay” in the present French sense of the word which connotes agnosticism. Now, under the new order, Religion has its due place and a number of privileges have been restored to the church. Marshal Petain himself is a churchgoer. The church, on its part, supports the new regime, although some diehards, such as: the monarchists’ Action Frangaise, occasionally accuse it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of being </span><span class="font7">lukewarm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An account in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font7">of April this year shows the revival of papal power there. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under a decree published today, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Council of the State Advisory Body </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">Legislation is empowered to issue legal status to religious congregations outlawed under the laws of 1901. The Cistercian </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Order </span><span class="font7">by a special ruling was reinstated in the Grande Chartreuse and certain other expelled (Catholic] orders were believed to have resumed activities in France. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most recent evidence of papal prosperity and harmonious working with the Nazi church “sword”, Hitler, is seen in the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Considerable Catholic missionary activity in the occupied South Russian territories is reported by the Catholic newspaper, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">LTtaiia, </span><span class="font7">of Milan, arriving here today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The leader of the missionaries is Luigi Cardinal Lavitrano, archbishop of Palermo. The cardinal is also president of a Catholic organization which for past years has been striving for a union between the Catholic and Orthodox churches [in other words, the swallowing of the Orthodox by the Catholic].</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Presumably with the consent of German military authorities, this church organization now has been given the opportunity propagate its ideas in Southern Russia.— St. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Louis Post-Dispatch,</span><span class="font7"> July 23, 1942 (Copyrighted). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now you see why archbishops bless as </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">‘Christian Crusade’ Hitler’s Russian venture and the pope gives his ‘consent by silence’? Religion is the binding tie; it is used to consolidate the Nazi gains.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Who Are Persecuted</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Not only does the Hierarchy prosper as shown above, but their enemies suffer. Invariably dissolution of all Masonic lodges follows' Nazi conquest In the Balkans, patriarchs and priests of the Orthodox church suffer and monasteries are confiscated. G reat pressure is exerted everywhere to force Orthodox church members to become Roman Catholic. The enmity of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy (not liberal-minded Catholics) has always been manifested against the Jews. This anti-Semitism is marked in the occupied lands, as well as Germany. Its manifestation by Jesuits and like-minded totalitarians is also noted in democratic lands. According to the encyclopedias, the rise of the Catholic church in the early centuries of Christianity marked the beginning of the troubles of the Jews, and such troubles have since then been in direct proportion to the prosperity and power of the Hierarchy. The Hierarchy’s betterment in France has been mentioned. The Jews are in great distress there now. The pope, despite centuries of persecution of the Jew’s by the Catholic church, has the gall to pose as the Jews’ friend and “protests” their treatment in France. The simple-minded will believe this latest papal propaganda move; the thinking person will see that the facts outweigh and contradict this pose taken to deceive the naive. Above all, Jehovah’s witnesses are the targets of Nazi persecution inspired by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>‘Come, Let Us Reason Together’</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">If Germany were trying to stamp out religion, and particularly Catholicism, as the public press wmuld have us believe, and for which fairy tale some gullible ones fall, why wmuld she inaugurate a “holy crusade” to ‘bring God to Godless Russia’? German Jesuits have so termed the war in Russia, that is, a &quot;holy crusade”. The Nazis would not seek to establish Catholicism in another country while trying to destroy it in its own land. The only thing the Nazi-Hierarchy combine wants to stamp out is Christianity, not religion, least of all the Catholic cult. So all the Hierarchy “protests”, and all their crying about being persecuted, and all their crocodile tears publicly shed for the Jew’s, are all sham. The poor, weak, oppressed, mistreated “church”, still reeking with the Protestant and Jewdsh blood she so freely shed during her first tyrannical reign, now wails piteously to the Protestant nations that she is persecuted by bad people. । Will the gag go over? Will her comeback attempt succeed so she can once more splash about in her sanguinary splendor of the Middle Ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In actual practice she is now’ collaborating with the Axis powers to accomplish that goal. Should it seem expedient to her in the future to switch over to the camp of the United Nations, this adroit maneuver will be executed with a skill becoming a past master in duplicity. But, despite any seeming success the Roman Catholic Hierarchy may attain for a short season, her final end is sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning such religious totalitarians Jehovah God’s decree has been entered and shall stand. “Yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.”— Daniel 11; 45.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>“Comfort All That Mourn”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS part of the commission of Jehovah’s witnesses, as ordained ministers of The Theocracy, “to comfort all that mourn.” (Isaiah 61:1-3; Matthew 5:4) It is therefore appropriate; that they should be ready to extend that comfort Jwhen asked to do so on the occasion of a funeral. It is a comfort to know that one’s dead are not in “purgatory” or the orthodox “hell”. It is a comfort to</span></p><img src="g_E_19430217_files/g_E_19430217-2.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:175pt;">

<p><span class="font7">At llochester, N. Y., recently, those present at a funeral heard words of real comfort, conveyed to them by transcription.

<p><span class="font6">Witnesses hold in common certain religious tenets and beliefs and recognize as their terrestrial governing organization the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. By their adherence to the organization of this religious corporation, the unincorporated body of Jehovah’s Witnesses are considered to constitute a recognized religious sect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The unusual character of organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* renders comparisons with recognized churches and religious organizations difficult. Certain members of Jehovah's Witnesses, by reason of the time which they devote, the dedication of their lives which they have made, the attitude of other Jehovah's Witnesses toward them, and the record kept of them and their work, are in a position where they may be recognized as having a standing in relation to the organization and the other members of Jehovah's Witnesses similar to that occupied by regular or duly ordained ministers of other religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Members of the Bethel Family are those members of Jehovah's</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Witnesses who devote their full time and effort to the manufacture and production of books, pamphlets, and supplies for the religious benefit of Jehovah's Witnesses, the purpose of which is to present the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and to convert others. For their religious services, the members of this group receive their subsistence and lodging and in addition a very modest monthly allowance. This group of individuals Consist of the office and factory workers at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, and workers in the executive offices at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, and at the Farms. Pioneers of Jehovah's Witnesses are those meitbers of Jehovah's Witnesses who devote all or substantially all of their time to the work of teaching the tenets of their religion and in the converting of others to their belief. A certified official list of members of the Bethel Family and pioneers is being transmitted to the State Directors of Selective Service by National Headquarters of the Selective Service System simultaneously with the release of this amended Opinion. The members of the Bethel Family and pioneers whose names appear upon such certified official list come within ths purview of section 5 (d) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, and they may be classified in Class IV-D. The status of members of the Bethel Family and pioneers whose names do not appear upon such certified official list shall be determined under the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Hope of a Perfect Day</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font7">VERY reasonable person will readily agree that there is more justice in a democracy that is an enlightened people’s rule than in a rule imposed by selfish and oppressive despots, whether religious or political. The present assault upon civilization, what little there was of it, by such despotic powers, will come to its end. It is Scripturally destined to fail. The real civilization of earth will come only when Jehovah’s King, Christ' Jesus, makes all things new. Then the earth shall yield its increase and the destroyer will no more devastate the fruitful fields or bring the people into want. The day of the aggressor will be at an end, and the present period of transition,- even if it be followed by a brief blackout of hope, is but the prelude of the perfect day when men shall learn war no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Police Force at Reedley</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Information is at hand that there is now another and first-class police force at Reedley, California. The present capable gentlemen on the staff do not wish to be classed or confused with the previous useless and lawless ones mentioned in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 602, issue of October 14, 1942. One nice thing about a republic is that when the people do get an inferior public servant they can change him; but in an authoritarian and totalitarian state they have to put up with him permanently. The people of Reedley are to be congratulated on now having a police force that is a credit to them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Baptism</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font7">ELIEVING on the Lord Jesus Christ does not mean merely a mental acceptance of the fad that He is the Son of God and Savior of the world. It means much more than that. It means that the person so believing also agrees to he ; , governed by the will of God, as Christ ' Jesus left an example. Belief includes the act of consecrating oneself to God, thus demonstrating real faith. In that manner the person comes into relationship with God through Christ, and has access into God’s favor. In order to continue to receive the favor of God one must continue to do the will of God. Having agreed to do God’s will, the proper thing for one then to do is to declare, confess and witness that he has so agreed, by being baptized in harmony with the example and command of the Lord Jesus Christ.—Matthew 3:13-17; 28:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Baptism, by immersion, is the symbol of a consecration to serve Jehovah God, to do His will in Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses and companions thus symbolize their consecration, usually in some outdoor body of water, but on occasion indoor pools or tanks are used, particularly when the weather is unfavorable for outdoor immersion. Some typical scenes appear on this page.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Your Unseen Adversary</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">IME was when the ones now the big devil and all the little devils were not devils. There was a time when they were “sons of God”, angelic sons, holy angels. Among these there was one especially bright and glorious creature styled “Lucifer, son of the morning”. (Isaiah 14:12) There is a grand description of him in Ezekiel 28: 11-19, in which, after explaining that he was at one time in Eden, the garden of God, it declares that in the garden he was “the anointed cherub that covereth”, unseen to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Lucifer saw Eve, and reasoned upon God’s method of establishing an earthly dominion, he said in his heart: T will estrange Eve and her husband from their Creator; instead of worshiping and obeying Him they shall worship and obey me’; “I will exalt my throne above the stars of God [the other bright shining ones of the angelic hosts]; . . . I will be like the most High.” (Isaiah 14:13,14) Man’s temptation and fall in the garden of Eden followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, then, when, in 1 John 3: 8, we read that “the Devil sinneth from the beginning”, we are to understand .that he sinned, not from the beginning of creation, nor even from the beginning of the fashioning of our earth, but from the beginning of the human race. The same thought was expressed by our Lord. /When He said of the Devil: “He was a murderer from the beginning” (John 8:44), Jesus locates just the point of time in history where Lucifer ceased to be Lucifer and became something else, a murderer; for the word “murderer” means a malicious, willful killer. Lucifer killed the first human pair by his wicked course; and in that he ceased to be Lucifer (Brightness) and became Satan (adversary), as he is now known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the words Devil, Satan, and Beelzebub refer to one and the same creature we can see from a comparison of certain passages of the Holy Scriptures. In the parable of the sower, as recorded in Mark 4:3-20, it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Satan </span><span class="font7">that comes immediately and takes away the Lord’s Word from the wayside hearers, the hard-hearted ones. In the same parable, as also recorded in Luke 8:4-15, it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the devil</span><span class="font7"> that comes and takes away the Word out of their hearts. The identity of Satan with the Devil is thus established. The identity of Satan as Beelzebub, prince of the devils, is established at Matthew 12:24-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has other titles than the above. To our Lord he was “the prince of this world” (John 14: 30), who had nothing in common with Him; also the prince that was to be cast out and to be judged. (John 12: 31; 16:11) To the apostle Paul Satan was “the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” (Ephesians 2:2); and he was “the god of this world [who] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them”. (2 Corinthians 4:4) To the prophet Ezekiel Satan was represented by “the king of Tyrus”.—Ezekiel 28:11-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul also urges all Jehovah’s people “to put on the whole armour of God”. To what end ? “That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” (Ephesians 6:11) The same apostle tells Christians respecting Satan that “we are not ignorant of his devices”. (2 Corinthians 2:11) A soldier who has no idea at all of the direction from which the enemy is likely to come is placed at a great disadvantage. In the day in which we live Satan makes his attack upon those who stand for the honor of Jehovah’s name. If he did not bend every energy to discredit those who are Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">vah’s witnesses it would show him as not being onto his job. The persecutions which he is bringing against the Lord’s Kingdom publishers is one of the best - evidences that these publishers are on the right side. They must be on the watch, because the reason why some are , ensnared by the adversary is that they * are not watching, not wakeful or alert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is very evident that when Satan took Jesus “up into a high mountain” and “showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time” and backed up his demonstration with the statement that “all this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is ‘delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it”, he was in person and not mentally making suggestions to the Lord Jesus; even as the angels ministered in person to the Lord thereafter. Evil was back of the suggestion that the Lord should demonstrate that He was the Son of God by leaping off the pinnacle of the temple. When it is stated that the Devil “brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple”, this was a descriptive suggestion, inasmuch as the account shows that throughout the whole period of temptation the Lord Jesus “was. there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan”, and was not on a mountain from which an earth-wide outlook could be had, neither at Jerusalem nor elsewhere. Not for an instant did Jesus permit Satan to inject selfish, ambitious, wicked and unfaithful thoughts into his mind fixed on holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ experience discloses that some of Satan’s suggestions come along misapplications of Scripture; for in connection with the temple suggestion Satan quoted and misapplied the scripture, ‘He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: and in their hands they • shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.’—Psalm 91:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Satan can and does put thoughts into the self-seeking, unfaithful mind appears from the scripture which tells of the circumstance of the Lord’s betrayal, and which tells of “the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him”. (John 13: 2) Instead of resisting Satan, Judas was completely obsessed, possessed, owned, and controlled by Satan himself. The obsession did not come until after Judas made his bargain with the chief priests to betray his Master. The bargain took place before the Passover supper, but it was not until the Passover was begun that “Satan entered into him” to'possess Judas, so the plan could be carried out without further delay.—John 13:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s suggestions are often along the line of apparent righteousness, apparent goofiness, apparent justice. It is for this reason that the apostle Paul says that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light”. (2 Corinthians 11:14)’ If his real motives were evident on the surface he would find fewer dupes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Satan can </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">touch</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah’s people in the sense of testing their integrity toward God, and thus seek to take away their standing with God (Job 2:4-7; Ephesians 4:27), yet he cannot grasp and&quot; hold the faithful ones who keep covenant with God; for such is the meaning of the word, at 1 John 5:18, translated “toucheth”. They can “overcome the wicked one”. (1 John 2:14) Satan opposes the Lord’s workers today by stirring up apparent reasons for discouragement, disobedience, disloyalty, discord, dissatisfaction and distrust. Eaith in God and unquestioning obedience to Him are the weapons to be used against Satan. Do not stop to argue with the Devil. He knows a lot more than you do in worldly matters; but you have the spirit and grace of God on your side as long as you keep busy, studying, practicing and proclaiming the truth. Those, who have faith in God cannot be discouraged, disobedient, disloyal, dissatisfied, distrustful or disagreeable to their brethren. They will be one in the service of God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beware of your unseen adversary.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>School Hitlerism </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Two Parts—</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2) <sub>i</sub></span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE first part of this article it was shown that the schools have been stressing things that have not been conducive to giving the pupils the start in life to which they are entitled. Emphasis and insistence upon outward gestures and fads have led to neglect of the instruction which would give the children a mental appreciation of the principles of freedom and democracy. It has resulted, too, in conditions of lawlessness and immorality that are startling in their extent. These are now given consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Immorality</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This article undertakes to show a condition in our schools paralleling those that prevail in Germany and for similar causes. Since Americans have observed the beginnings of encroachment of Nazism, and failed to sound the warning (except a few scattered voices “in the wilderness”), it may be expected that the advance will increase. And one of the results, as disclosed by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation's </span><span class="font7">review of Germany’s methods set forth in the book entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Education for Death, </span><span class="font7">is gross immorality among the nation’s youth. Even the degeneration of our schools is seen to follow the Nazi decline. In New York an 11-percent increase in delinquency is noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the facts disclosed by the children, interviews with students reveal an even worse condition. In one school in California it is a common thing for girls to be sent home because of pregnancy. It is further alleged that much of the promiscuousness is practiced under the trees and on the very grounds of the campus. Married boys and girls acquaint their younger companions with . premature knowledge, which appears to lead many to desire to find out for themselves. Alcohol and tobacco, including the terrible marijuana, likewise help the demoralization along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until these conditions became prevalent in the schools it was never necessary for cities to adopt curfew laws requiring unaccompanied children to be off the streets after 9 p. m. San Francisco and Los Angeles have both adopted such laws. In the case of Los Angeles, hoodlums of high-school age were Attacking and robbing pedestrians in gangs. Several hundred of these were rounded up, all of them boys in the teens age. This menace to the lives and property of citizens has not yet been completely wiped out, and it is causing the authorities much concern. Assault, robbery, and rape are still on the rampage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The situation in New York is causing widespread dismay. A recent article in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> (December 11, 1942) states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Teachers, alarmed by the breakdown of discipline among city school children, have appealed to the police over the heads of the Board of Education for protection, it became known yesterday. The step was unprecedented. In a letter to Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine, the New York Teachers Guild (Local 2, American Federation of Teachers) urged the immediate help of the police force to cheek the wave of terrorism in schools, particularly those in underprivileged areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font7"> of the same date carried the following item, going into some details of juvenile lawlessness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The president of the New York Teachers Guild said today police had promised to protect teachers against beatings by unruly pupils and intruders. She cited a series of incidents “which vary in gravity from outright murder to mere threat”. The president, Mrs. Rebecca Simonson, said forty police precinct captains, following her appeal to Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine, had advised her they would send police by radio ear upon receipt of a telephone call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[A Brooklyn junior high school teacher recently was shot to death by two former pupils whpm he reprimanded for smoking in the school building. The boys received long prison terms.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some teachers have reported blackened eyes suffered in encounters with unruly pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That juvenile crime is general is shown by the Fresno </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hee,</span><span class="font7"> which, under date of August 16,1942, says :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the first six months of 1942 more 19 year-old boys were arrested for various crimes than any other group and 18.5 percent of all those arrested in this period were under 21. There were 12,991 19-year-old youths arrested, and the crimes of robbery and automobile theft predominated. The 18-year-olds totaled 12,865; those of 20, 11,830; and of 21, 11,946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is also an increase of immorality, accompanied by venereal disease, among school children between 15 find 19 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">School work lags as crime increases. Poorer work is noted this year than before the outbreak of the war in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first nine months of 1942 juvenile crime took an alarming jump. This is blamed partly to the war. Children (under 21) accounted for 18 percent more assaults, 23 percent more sex offenses, 22 percent more gambling, and 30 percent more drunkenness, than during the same period in 1941, according to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn Maryland a young miscreant of 16 shot a man of q8. Two girls of 14 were also involved in this crime. At Four Mile, N. J., a girl of 15 was killed in a woodland cabin. A Boston high-school girl of 15 was shot and killed by a young man with whom she “kept company”. Various cities are proposing curfew laws to curb the crime trend among the young people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Admittances of delinquents in three Massachusetts reformatories have risen 60 percent; and in Connecticut some schools show’ a 66-percent rise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A friend of the writtsr was on her way home on South LaBrea in Los Angeles, w’hen jumped on by two hard-looking young boys. Though elderly, she is strong, having spent many<sup>7</sup> years of her life as a masseuse. While she pushed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">20*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">one young ruffian away<sup>7</sup>, another grabbed her pocketbook. Be it said for this courageous woman that although her clothes were almost torn from her she repelled the assault and recovered her pocketbook. Someone approached from a distance gnd the kids fled, but as she continued to walk home they<sup>7</sup> followed, even prowling around her door, but not risking another attack. Nor were they<sup>7</sup> ever apprehended by<sup>7</sup> the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Washington, D. C., has its own particular problem with girls of high-school age. An article by<sup>7</sup> Arthur F. Hermann, quoted from the San Diego </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune Sun </span><span class="font7">of October 2, 1942, says: “Vice in Washington, the wartime capital of the nation, is threatening to become what authorities state will be a big business.” It was disclosed at a joint meeting of army, navy, congressmen, and public health officials that there were 45,000 cases of syphilis, and the great increase was ascribed to prostitution. There were said to be more than a thousand known prostitutes who plied their trade daily<sup>7</sup> in houses and on the streets. “The investigators found that street solicitation <sup>f</sup>is higher in Washington than in any other American city<sup>7</sup> it had surveyed’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prostitution has been with humanity since ancient times. But note the influx of young girls of high-school age, and the testimony of the police official that this is a recent development:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In past years these have been largely women of mature years, but Captain Rhoda Milliken, head of the women’s division, admits that there has been a recent influx of 15-, 16-, and 17-year-old girls who have “entered the business and are giving us a lot of trouble”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These young girls, according to Captain Milliken, come to Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mentally ill-equipped,</span><span class="font7"> but nonetheless hopeful of finding employment in some war-swollen government agency. Upon failing in this, many of them gravitate to the only means of livelihood open to them, she said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note that the degradation of these girls, according to Captain Milliken, was chiefly the result of being “mentally ill-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">equipped”. What a condemnation of our system of society and education thus proclaimed ! That girl children having either no parents or such a repugnance for them, their homes, their schools, and so poor an education as to render them unfit to earn their own living, must pawn their bodies from man to man! And their name is legion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The schools cannot escape a measure of responsibility for these appalling conditions. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> rejoices, in passing, that there is more hope for these poor girls than for their hypocritical guardians who sent them to ignominy. The words of Jesus are the authority for this statement: ‘Werily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.” (Matthew 21: 31) “By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not.” —Hebrews 11: 31; James 2: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides the professional harlots, how many others have entered the insecure relation of mistress to their employers, or other associates, and as yet escape classification by the police department? It is not maintained that this is entirely the fault of the schools. Some of the blame falls on the homes for not bringing up the children in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord” (Ephesians 6:4); some upon the churches for not teaching God’s laws of righteousness. (Deuteronomy 4: 9,10; 11:19; Proverbs 22: 6) But this fact does not lessen the responsibility of school boards; for they are often composed of parents and church members. Let them now consider the results fearfully. As for the children the words of Isaiah now have terrible significance: “They which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.” —Isaiah 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the face of this abominable record the school boards continue to set. their authority above God’s law and even the law of the land, and instead of teaching righteousness, they punish righteousness. (1 Corinthians 8:12) No wonder from the corridors of the schools pour forth the sons and daughters of perdition. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> rejoices that the day of wicked authority is soon done!— Psalm 145: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“the Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. . . . He considered! all their works ... a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.” (Psalm 33:13,15,16,18) God is with the little children who obey His law, and against the school boards which persecute them, whether such boards like to be told this fact or not. “I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.”—Isaiah 13:11,13.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>“Hearings”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">It has been observed that immorality and decay follow disobedience to Jehovah’s moral laws. English and American law was therefore founded upon God’s law as set forth in the Bible, and the eminent English jurist, Sir William Blackstone, in his authoritative </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries, </span><span class="font7">a requirement in the course in most law colleges, sets forth the principle that God’s law is binding everywhere and at all times. “The revealed or divine laws are to be found only in the Holy Scriptures.” Thomas Cooley, whose </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional Limitations,</span><span class="font7"> an American authority, likewise reiterates the principle that the conscience must be left unfettered in its yearning to obey Jehovah. Another American jurist, hated by religionists, but loved by men of God, namely, Judge J. F. Rutherford, compiled the Scriptural and legal defenses of God’s servants with respect to the flag, entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State,</span><span class="font7"> and this has been presented to all school boards. Petitions have requested hearings for the reinstatement of children of Jehovah’s witnesses, filed with every school board in the United States where expulsions or suspensions for this cause have -occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These petitions ask for an amendment to the school rule commanding the salute so that Jehovah’s witnesses may merely 4 stand at attention during the ceremony, thus showing full respect according to the recent law of Congress (Public Law 623, 77th Congress), above referred to. They are also willing to go farther and offer a substitute pledge putting Jehovah first and flag second. The Catholics claim to put &quot;the flag of God” above that of the United States and are permitted to do this by the recent enactment. With the petition is also presented by verbal reading the articles “Respect to the Flag”, which describes this Public Law 623, passed last June, and cites the penalties .that boards may incur who continue to deprive child citizens of substantial rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How do such boards react to this strenuous effort on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to obey the law of the land, as well as God’s law? How do they treat this painstaking effort to reconcile the authorities to their position, so that neither the boards nor the members themselves shall suffer punishment at the hands of Jehovah? The boards that may be convinced by this last act that Jehovah’s witnesses are right, and permit them to return to school on the terms appealed for, are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font7"> included in what is said hereafter in regard to the &quot;bitterenders” who stubbornly resist righteousness. The latter, like the Pharaoh of Moses’ day, are not moved by words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few instances of boards reinstating Jehovah’s witnesses’ children follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In accordance with a decision of the United States attorney general, three children of Jehovah’s witnesses at Ascutney, Vt., were re-instated by the local school board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Luzerne county, Pa., Mrs. Mary Nemchik, one of Jehovah’s witnesses and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">a widow, who had been arrested because her children failed to salute the flag, was released, and her children returned to school, in accordance with a decision of the Court of Quarter Sessions in November, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Avondale, Ariz., children of Jehovah’s witnesses returned to school when it was agreed they would stand at attention during the flag-salute program, though taking no part in the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Virginia, Minn., children were returned to school by a decision of the district court in their favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Gillespie, Ill., also, the local board readmitted one of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses in response to the filingj of the petition by the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another instance is the reinstatement of pupils at Derby, Cohn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Watsonville, California, the school board, after giving due consideration to the petition, concluded that it was proper to let the children return to school, both from the Scriptural and the legal standpoint. Reports of boards in other cities reaching the same conclusion are coming in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The arbitrary boards have generally granted &quot;hearings” on this new petition with its accompanying proof, as a salute to fairplay. The gesture is as far as their respect for justice goes, however, and further action reveals the shallowness of the minds of men who enforce the ceremony and ignore the principles. They are, of course, not familiar with Jehovah’s admonition, “He that an-swereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him” (Proverbs 18:13); because, long before Jehovah's witnesses appear before them, they have hardened their hearts against all appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “hear” occurs more than 400 times in the King James Version; derivatives, about a thousand times more. It is often used as a command from Jehovah to give ear to His instruction. For example; “Hear ye, 0 mountains, the Lord’s controversy.”. (Micah 6:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Aet&amp;3:23) “Hear instruction, and be wise.” (Proverbs 8: 33) “Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth.” (Micah 1:2) “This is my beloved Son: hear him,” (Mark 9:7) The Lord certainly did not mean that to “hear” meant merely to endure the vibrations upon the eardrums. Hearing was for proper instruction, and obedience was required thereafter.—Deuteronomy 30: 2,8,20; 13:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moreover, in ancient days there were many who followed the course pursued in our educational institutions. They “have ears, and hear not”. (Jeremiah 5:21) “Hearing they hear not, neither do they understand,” said the great Teacher. (Matthew 13:13) Boards that sit with stolid faces while the wisdom of God's Word is poured forth diligently by His witnesses are in the above class described by Jesus. Little children and their parents, showing their willingness to do anything in order to receive an education, except break God’s law, are received with cold animosity, which is more often increased by the stern warning of Jehovah’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Present also at these “hearings” is an ugly foreigner, a specter foreign to Americanism. The ugly form of the snake is there, in the guise of religious intolerance. Flailing like a sea serpent, it foments waves of persecution from the stagnant waters of religious superstition. The reptile cavorts beneath the school boards, pushing them along the stream which flows to the cataract of destruction by Jehovah!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Spineless, Rudderless Boards</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">“Boards,” said President Theodore Roosevelt, as if prophetic of those that misgovern schools today, “are long, narrow, and wooden.” A more apt description* is hard to imagine. The educational planks are woody clear through. How could it be expected of such timber to receive instruction? Instead of pillars</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 17,1#43 </span><span class="font7">to support learning, they resemble logs cast into the waters of religious prejudice, and propelled by a modern “generation of vipers” bent on wrecking everything that does not swim their way. (Matthew 23:33) Spineless, rudderless boards, rushing headlong , to the' sea of destruction! “Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. But he that sinneth against me [wisdom or instruction] wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.” (Proverbs 8: 33, 36) “There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the wavs of death.”—Proverbs 14:12; 16:25. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chief monster that befouls the waters of truth has bathed and grown strong under the protection of American institutions, only to turn its fangs into the heart of the nation. It is a foreign enemy administered from Rome, oathbound to destroy the four freedoms which we cherish. It is this religious Hierarchy that has whipped itself and its servants into a fervor of “patriotism” to furnish excuse for the destruction of the Lord’s servants. The deathdirk of Fascism is more terrible concealed in the folds of the beloved flag. And already that once immaculate symbol has been soiled by the tears of little children and fouled by the blood of righteous men who defended it. 0 America, let not Hitler and the Vatican tell you how to wave and respect the national .emblem, lest it be made to hide the dagger-thrust to the heart of freedom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The action of these school boards is just such a misuse of that high emblem. No greater travesty could be found than the claim of men to serve the cause of patriotism by the very act of destroying the principles for which the real patriots died. The enforced salute is one example. There are others that mark the spread of Hitlerism. In September, 1942, members of Jehovah’s witnesses were mobbed, beaten, and shot, in Oregon, Arkansas, and Illinois, for the alleged-reason, where any reason was forthcom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ing, that they did not salute the flag. Remember at this point that the enforced flag salute is in effect forbidden by Public Law 623, and by the provisions of the Constitution. Bloody scenes of -carnage, in which TIis witnesses were victims, raged unchecked, and, in fact, were aided and abetted by “officers of t the law”. (For details see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font7">&lt;&nbsp;No. 604.) Bruised and broken bodies of the witnesses of Jehovah still lingered long in hospitals upon beds of pain. Such is the harvest of Hitlerism, nurtured by school boards, and blooming in mob violence. If not immediately repudiated by America this bloody record will form a part of the epitaph of the United States. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been suggested that there is a deeper cause for outrages in the name of the flag than mere patriotism misguided. In fact, Romanism has always worn the garb of the nation infested, saluted its flag, shouted for its welfare, simply as a smoke-screen to conceal treachery. This great danger to our country, which is now beyond the control of men, appears more clearly as we examine next the schools entirely controlled by Jesuitism, particularly the Catholic schools and universities.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Conquest Aided by Seduction of Schools</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">It is naturally in the Catholic school itself that it is possible to inspect the Jesuit ideal for an America of the future, fully Catholicized according to the standards of the Italian Papacy. The parochial school and the higher institutions of learning are therefore viewed with the thought in mind that the education of all Americans in similar academies of &quot;learning” is the program sheduled by Catholic Action. As prophetic samples of what is purposed for all youth by the Papal Axis, the examination becomes more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The question arises at the outset: Why do Catholics require schools (which they claim should be, and in many places are, maintained at public expense) to give religious instruction, when they have an overabundance of untaxed churches, established for that very purpose? WTiat is the matter with the public schools of our nation ? The answer, as baldly stated by Catholic spokesmen on numerous occasions, is, that the public, nonsectarian schools teach the “heresy bf freedom”. Catholic authorities lament any spreading of this “pernicious doctrine”. Not content with sovereignty over the child's religious training, nor with the subjection of his home life to devout Catholic parents, they demand the rest of his waking hours, yea, even extending their sphere of influence into his sleep, by the terrifying descriptions of “purgatory” and “hell torment”. With such a program of “education” there is no opportunity for the youngster to absorb the much-feared principles of “liberty and justice for all”. Thus reared without contact from the “pernicious errors” of freedom, he becomes (if diligence is unremitting to protect him from the &quot;error’ which surrounds him in this “pseudo-democracy”) an American Catholic, as much like an Italian Catholic, or a French or Irish Catholic, as the ingenuity of his tutors can make him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, in practice it is not as easy as that. No one in this country can be prevented entirely from learning of its benevolent principles. Once hearing about it the Catholic is apt to love freedom as much as another, perhaps more, as he has not enjoyed its blessings to any extent. Often he attempts to graft it upon the structure of the intolerant “church” law, to the disgust of his superiors. There are thus many just and liberal Catholics, but, whether they know it or not, they<sup>7</sup> are without favor in the eyes of the Catholic ecclesiastical authorities. But it is the purposes of Catholic training, and its generally baneful effect, rather than the exceptions who do not conform to type, In the which we are concerned. The fact that they are not always successful does not lessen, but on the contrary strengthens, the de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">termination of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to Jesuitize America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this process the school is an important theater of action. Discussing the Catholic control of schools, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted ^Catholic</span><span class="font7"> (January, 1942) thus outlines the aims of this organization:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outs tan ding among the claims of the Catholic Church is its asserted right to control all education. The late Pope Pius XI went so far as to lay down (in his encyclical on education in 1931) that the Catholic church’s mission to educate 'embraces every’ nation without exception, and all men, within or without her membership, and there is no power on earth that may lawfully oppose her or stand in her w<sup>r</sup>ay’. The Catholic church holds that education is a spiritual function and that its direction and control must rest with her alone, “the only true church estab. lished on earth by God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Efforts to carry this outrageous claim into practice arc, aggressively made in this country year in and year out. The public school system is insolently styled “publicly supported paganism”; Catholic children are strictly forbidden by canon law to attend public schools or private non-sectarian schools. In some places Catholic parents are refused the sacraments of their church if they send their children to such schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same issue, in an article entitled “Catholic Pressure on the Public Schools”, recounts the indifferent successes of the Hierarchy to have legislation enacted to legalize public support of the parochial school. Such efforts failed in Texas, South Dakota, Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio; while efforts to obtain released-time from public schools for Catholic religious training failed in California, New’ Mexico, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. “Only in Massachusetts was the effort successful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On July 25 the Supreme Court of Missouri handed down a decision which ended the practice in many Missouri counties of “incorporating parochial schools into the public school system while allowing them to retain their</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 17, 1843 </span><span class="font7">religious character”. This “forceful and unanimous decision most emphatically denied any use of public funds for the support of religious schools”. The decision is further interesting because it furnishes a graphic description of parochial school routine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We find the usual school day commencing with prayer in the morning. After prayer the pupils are marched, one room at a time, to the Catholic church next door for holy mass. After mass the pupils are marched back again to their schoolrooms, where they receive religious instruction. In this they study the Catholic catechism and the child’s Catholic Bible. On one or two days of each w’eek the parish priest gives religious instruction to the pupils in the mid-morning, either at the church or in the schoolhouse chapel. On Friday afternoons the pupils are again marched to the church for confession. In the quarterly “Teachers’ Report to the Parents” the subject of “Religion” is included under “Branches Pursued”, and a grade on this subject is given each pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is the kind of “education” that Rome would demand for everybody, and a new definition of freedom would be forced upon us, the “freedom” to obey the laws of the Catholic church. The latest papal blast against the public school system is broughtto our attentionby </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted&quot;Catholic</span><span class="font7"> of November, 1942: '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bishop Blasts Public Schools, Catholic Bishop Karl J. Alter, of Toledo, Ohio, ardent supporter of the Petain and Franco regimes, has issued a pontifical blast against Jhc American public schools. He has ordered what amounts to excommunication—refusal of the sacraments—against parents or guardians who enroll children in the public schools or secular colleges without his consent. This is in accordance with orders from Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bitterness of Jesuit hatred for public schools is further disclosed in the booklet by Jesuit Paul Blakely entitled, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“May</span><span class="font7"> an American Oppose the Public School?” The intolerant attitude follows the Catholic into .Catholic universities. An incident is related in the September issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic</span><span class="font7"> where</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Roger J. Schwartz, a senior in the school of journalism of Marquette University, “was expelled from the university [a week before his graduation] because he, . a Catholic, persisted in marrying a Protestant girl.” In explaining the ruling “Father” R. C. McCarthy stated that &quot;no question of grades was involved”, i Schwartz ‘had been expelled from the university solely because he was guilty of a serious infringement of church law”. McCarthy said that under university rules non-Catholic students could marry non-Catholics, and Catholic students could marry Catholics, but that Catholic students could xot marry non-Catholics without “special dispensation”. Of course, such “dispensations” are hard to get, and costly. Again </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> notes the Catholic suppression of freedom, when in their power to accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for the moral effect of Catholic education, a few examples well known to all should suffice on this point: Cardinal Cesare Borgia, and his sister Lucrezia, most famous poisoners of all time; Catherine de Medici, niece of the pope, and organizer of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day, in 1572, the most horrible of the acts of Catholic persecution which drove the French Huguenots to the shores of South Carolina; “Bloody Mary,” of England, who, about the same time, caused so many Protestants to be burned to death; Philip II of Spain, who sent the Armada against England, in 1588; the duke of Alva, and Thomas Torquemada, who were expert at inflicting the tortures of the “Holy Inquisition”; these were all given a Catholic education and bore much fruit to this form of “instruction” centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there are some more recent examples. For instance, there was Al Capone, noted Chicago gangster; Francisco Franco, butcher of Republican Spain, made knight of the papal order of St. Gregory the Great; another member of this order, ex-Judge Afar tin T. ATan-ton, recently convicted of selling justice; and do not forget Leopold of Belgium, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">26 </span><span class="font7">who sold out his country and betrayed the French; Joseph Tiso, Roman Catholic priest, and seller-out of Czechoslovakia, at present Slovakian chief of state; Pierre Laval, French “heel” of Hitler’s boot; Emil Hacha, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Nazi </span><span class="font7">president of Bohemia-Moravia; Konrad </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hen</span><span class="font7">lein, betrayer of Sudetenland; and Adolf Hitler,—all recipients of preferred Catholic instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just how many others have embarked on careers of less notorious immorality, not to say crime, it is impossible to say. But well known to statistics are the tables compiled by corrective institutions and prisons, that the percentage of Catholic inmates is frequently twice </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">three times the percentage of Catholics among the total population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A comparison between the total Catholic population and the Catholic prison population in certain representative states is significant:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">New York Arizona California Wisconsin Wyoming</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Total Catholic Population</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">26.73 percent 33.16 percent 16.83 percent 23.79 percent</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">43.52 percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">32.18 percent</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">This docs not speak well for the claims of Catholic educators that their teaching is essential to the morality of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be seen that morality is not the objective of the Catholic educators, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">subjection. As for the non-Catholic schools, it is their intention to undermine them. While from without every effort is made to force the abandonment of the non-sectarian public school, from within the Jesuits raise a furor for the enforced flag salute. It is indeed a bitter day when Americans are expelled from their own schools, which they have built up, paid for, and cherished, at the instance of the Italian Hierarchy, who while blessing the armies of America’s enemies abroad fights to exterminate her schools and freedoms at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stressing the right of American children to an education in the country’s pub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">lie schools, President Roosevelt said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From that time on down to our own days, .it has always been recognized as a responsibility of government that every child have ' the right to a free and Liberal education. . . . In recent times, in the last decade, this right of free education that has become a part of the national life in our land has taken on an added significance because of certain events in certain other lands. For a very large por-' tion of the world that right no longer exists.' Almost the first freedom to be destroyed, as dictators take control, is the freedom of learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some totalitarian-minded school officials have already destroyed “freedom of learning” for children who place Jehovah God first in their allegiance and object to the Nazi ideology of forced salutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt there are some who have fallen into the trap of the Axis, and consider that failure to enforce the flag salute will endanger the country’s welfare. It is to such that may have been honestly deceived that this article is chiefly addressed. To them this question is propounded: How can the obedience to Jehovah of any of its citizens endanger a country that is officially praying to Jehovah for blessing and protection of its armed forces upon the field of battle? Can even the least reasonable believe that Jehovah would bless the persecutors of His faithful servants? Let calmness replace passion now, and sane rulings be made by bqards who believe in the existence of the Lord. There is no disaster to he compared to the Lord’s vengeance. Beware lest it overtake you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides those ensnared by the sweep of totalitarianism there are many more who are “pretended patriots”, wolves in sheep’s clothing, the emissaries of Rome and Hitler. Chief among these are the more than 6,000 Jesuits freely permitted to conduct their espionage work upon these shores. The business of this gestapo is discord, deception, and destruction. They constantly prey on Americans by stirring up strife, disunity and distrust. Of them George Washington warned:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Beware the impostures of pretended patriotism.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy, operating from Vatican City, has unleashed the secret army of Jesuits, like a pack of bloodhounds, on the trail of the Lord’s witnesses. They infest school boards and are found in every element of society. Because of them Jehovah’s witnesses today often leave a path red with their own blood. (See </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 604.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler has declared that he will wreck America from -within. Now, let there be no mistake; the enforcement of the flag salute is a dagger at the heart of freedom, and a panzer movement no less effective because it is accomplished without tanks. Behind it is the Devil himself, bent on driving all creation into the ditch of destruction, resulting from opposition to Jehovah. “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Psalm 9:17.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Issue</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The great question before all men is: Whom shall each serve? “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Romans 6:16) “No man can serve two masters: ... Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” (Matthew 6:24) “Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, T say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.” (John 8:34) It is plain, then, that the flag-salute issue is permitted by Jehovah as a test of the obedience of His servants, and to allow opportunity for school boards to demonstrate whom they will obey. The hearings before these boards, therefore, become a part of the great judgment of the nations now in progress by Christ Jesus. (John 5:22,27; Matthew 25:32) The punishment meted out to the children is counted as done to the Judge himself. —Matthew 25: 44-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The salute is a small thing, but the issue, obedience, is of paramount im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">portance to the individual children and to the individual members of the boards. Those who think that Jehovah’s witnesses make too much fuss about obedience have forgotten the results of eating just one little piece of forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. Those who think that the boards will be excused by the Judge on their pretext that they act to serve the country’s welfare are also gravely mistaken. Those who think their execution will be stayed by the claim that such was merely a necessary act of discipline will likewise plead in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plain facts, as fully demonstrated, discredit all the defenses of the wicked. Neither patriotism, nor discipline, nor morality has been fostered, but these important virtues have been degraded among the American student body in a manner that is without parallel in the annals of education, and during the same period of. time that enforcement of a flag salute has had much attention from otherwise negligent educators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus described this very folly of men in His day: “Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote [speck] that is in thy brother’s eye.” (Luke 6:42) He also castigated ' such hypocrisy thuswise: “Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.” (Matthew 23:24) “Blind guides” well describes “educators” who are trying to find a “speck” of wrong-doing on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses, and meanwhile wade through a whole mud pile of ignorance and immorality. Thieves and harlots freely ply their trade within and without the school grounds while Jehovah’s faithful children are denied the rights to education on “moral” or “disciplinary” grounds. In these same yards hypocrisy has indeed ripened and gone to seed!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">producing atheists, ignoramuses, harlots, and thieves. Is it not about time that the schools gave some account of themselves to the taxpayers who support them? Why should these dignitaries be immune to question? Is the public content for them to keep on waving a flag and let everything else “go to pot”? Or do parents and citizens want something else for their money? Why should not the school boards themselves be kept in due subjection to their duties? These are civic questions that confront all American families, and are now crying for a remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>f</sub> But the civic questions, serious as they be, are trivial compared to the danger the actions of these school boards bring upon all involved. The dictates of conscience should generally be respected, but, when obedience to Jehovah is the compelling urge of the moral impulse, to tamper therewith is fatal. (1 Corinthians 8:12) It is presumptuous interference with Jehovah’s servants. On appeal when the boards are fully apprised of the position of Jehovah’s witnesses and the officials refuse to hear, the words pass beyond the schoolrooms. Passing upward the appeal has “entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth [armies]”. —James 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for the faithful obedient children, they demonstrate love for Jehovah, and although the countenances of school boards are set in hostility, yet is the knowledge of complete integrity sweeter than the applause of the world. Jesus despised the shame, for the joy that was set before Him. (Hebrews 12:2) They who are His followers will do likewise. ' “If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.” (Ecclesiastes 5:8) “Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.”—Isaiah 35: 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">OOD paragraphing is based on the principles of unity. Paragraphing is the division of thoughts into handy, sensible units to show the introduction of a new idea, a new group of ideas or a direct quotation. The only hard and fast rule to remember is to place in the same paragraph all sentences related to the same thought or the same phase of a thought. Each paragraph has a topic sentence, which is generally the first one of the paragraph. In it the writer states the main thought of the paragraph. In effect he says, “This is what I’m going to talk about.” It is the signpost for what comes next. This sentence may take the form of a- forecast or of a question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The last sentence is often referred to as the clincher sentence. This serves as a conclusion to the paragraph. In fact, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 17, 1943 </span><span class="font7">these two substantial statements, the topic and clincher sentences holding the paragraph together, serve the same purpose as do the introduction and conclusion of the talk as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The development or filling in of the paragraph between these two opening and closing sentences provides the specific details, description, illustration, bits of proof, without which the paragraph would be meaningless. It supplies sentences elaborating the topic sentence and developing its thought in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These sentences may be arranged in any one of four ways: order of action, order of time, order of space, order of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order of action consists of starting with the preliminaries and progressing to the beginning of action, middle of the action, end of the action and the consequences. One would use this method of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sentence arrangement if he were telling of David’s slaying Goliath. The preliminaries would be David's speech to Goliath concerning Jehovah’s name. The beginning of action would be David’s running toward the Philistine to meet him. The middle action would be David’s, putting his hand into his bag to select a stone for his sling. The end of the action and the consequences would be the throwing the stone and Goliath’s falling on his face. All this could be easily worked into one paragraph. All narrative material is arranged this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order of time consists in taking next - whatever happens next. In plain language, put the first things first and the last things last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order of space is used mostly in descriptions. A landscape, for example, may be described from foreground, middle distance, and remote distance. Or it might be from left to center and to right. A building may be described from the foundation to roof or roof to foundation. With this type of arrangement your sentences have a logical sequence in space order</span><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> and do not skip about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order of importance consists in putting the most important matter first and following it with matters of less importance. Or the arrangement can be reversed, starting with the less important facts and working up to a climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the arrangement of the sentences is decided upon, next follows the development of those sentences to bring out the detail and argument. There are several methods of development that may be used; six are here mentioned. They are: by definition, by example, by comparison or contrast, by repetition, by elimination, and by relation to cause and effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by definition is accomplished by defining a key word or words in the topic sentence. If the paragraph _ were to start with the sentence, &quot;Jehovah ' has with great long-suffering endured the activity of persecutors for several thousands of years,” and then one proceeded to define persecution as, “To persecute means to pursue persistently in a manner to injure, grieve and afflict,” then the development would be from the standpoint of definition; for here one defines a key word in the topic sentence. In the same paragraph one could define the word “endure” as applied to his discussion, for that, likewise, is a key word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by example means to cite examples in support of the key thought. If one had such a statement as, “No one who advocates for The Theocracy can escape persecution from those that work for the opposition government,” and then gave examples of Abel, Jeremiah, Daniel, Christ, and the apostles as evidence to prove the statement, that would be development by example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by comparison or contrast consists of comparing like things or contrasting two or more dissimilar things. A paragraph in point is one from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> discussion of “Covenant Obligations”. It starts, “In striking contrast to unfaithful Urijah is the prophet Jeremiah, who was a faithful witness of Jehovah.” The paragraph is then developed by contrasting the respective courses of action of Urijah and Jeremiah and the result to each because of such action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by repetition is not as common as the other methods; for usually the discussion of the thought repeated is sufficiently long to constitute a phase of thought and is put in a separate paragraph. It is, however, used in short paragraphs. Such a paragraph would be, “We are in the Time of the end’. It is a time of woe for the world; for darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people. It is a time of importance for those that must now choose whom they will serve. It is a time of apprehension for God’s covenant people lest they, by word or deed, come short of their covenant and displease Him. It is a time of joy for the faithful, for they, by faith, see the vindication of Jehovah’s name.” The repetition of a key word of the topic sentence</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">is what gives the emphasis in this type of development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by elimination is very forceful in argumentation. It consists of eliminating from the discussion those points not applicable to the proof the writer is presenting. For example, “The Theocracy is a government by the immediate direction or administration of God. It is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font7"> based on a ‘share the rule’ proposition, as is a democracy. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Nor</span><span class="font7"> is it a government based on power being vested in one creature, as is a monarchy. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> the immediate direction and administration of the world by Jehovah God through His anointed King, Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Development by relation to cause and effect is one commonly used. Causes or factors are discussed, which causes produce certain effects. As: The demons rule the earth; this is one cause of world distress. Here world distress is the effect or result. One might go from effect to cause: world distress to demon rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes, no matter how well the sentences are arranged and the paragraphs developed, the connections between paragraphs are loose. They lack coherence. This fault may be overcome by the use of connectives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A connective is a word or group of words that acts as a bridge from one thought to another. It may be a single word, called a transitional conjunction; or a group of words, called a transitional expression. Every writer or speaker should have at his command a long list of connectives, enough that he will not have to repeat even once in a composition. These can be grouped in six divisions, for use in any given setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To express change of time use: previously, formerly, meanwhile, then, now, since then, after this, thereafter, heretofore, at last, at length, from now on. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To express similar point of view use: likewise, next in importance, in the same manner, similarly, in addition, too, also, that is to say, moreover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To denote change in point of view use: seriously, frankly, on the other hand,, in another sense, but, in fact, still, on the contrary, nevertheless, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To convey emphasis use: indeed, add to this, besides, in addition to this, even more, above all, to repeat, furthermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To make a forecast of what is to follow use: first, to continue, parenthetically, by the way. For example: There are three factors to consider. First, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And for summary use: therefore, for these reasons, we now see, as we have seen, in conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the methods of developing paragraphs as shown in this study may be used to advantage in writing or composing talks. One paragraph may use a combination of these methods. Then, by the use of connectives, if the thought continuity itself from one paragraph to another is not sufficient, give the finished whole coherence where necessary.</span></p>

During one of the summer months the State of New Jersey maintained a summer ‘White Hou&amp;e’ for the New Jersey executive at Sea Girt. The governor scrutinized the food bills closely, and this is what he found: that an average of 20 persons are supposed to</span></p>

It seems, according to the bills, that each person at the summer cottage had raw food purchased for him to the amount of $8.90 per day. Edison thinks something is rotten in New Jersey, and he isn’t the only one that thinks it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to &quot;fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Three hundred cities from coast to coast have been selected for the nation-wide gathering of Jehovah’s people during the &quot;Call to Action” Testimony Period, in the month of Apnl The Assembly days are Saturday and Sunday, April 17 and 18, 1943, just befoie the date for celebrating the memorial of Christ’s death. In line with transportation and fuel restrictions, this spreading of assembly points will obviate all need of long-distance traveling and will make the Assembly accessible to everyone making a little effort to attend. Because of the importance of each feature, all gatherings will follow identically the same program, with like materials for presentation. It will be two days of edifying association together in field service, worship, special exhortation and instruction. AB persons bearing good-will should be urged and helped to attend. This wiU be a most worthy preliminary to observing the Lord’s supper the next day.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DESIRE FOR LIFE IN THE NEW WORLD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.&quot; —Ps. 34:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH will make life worth living in the new I world. That means it will be a world of righteous-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> ness. “For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: the upright shall behold his face.&quot; (Ps. 11:7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> He will determine who will live in the righteous new world. To such only will he give life abundant without end. It is his will and purpose that both heaven and earth be inhabited forever by intelligent creatures living in perfect harmony with Him and under his complete protection. without molestation by any doers of iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Jehovah is the never-exhausted Source of life, and all living creation is absolutely dependent upon him. “Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.” (Ps. 3G: S, 9) Jehovah has purposed the new world of life and light and has appointed the time for its beginning. That time is at hand, according to the testimony of his prophetic Word. He has provided a way to life in that blessed world, and all persons who desire life in righteousness should gain knowledge of Jehovah and his purpose, and act on it. “For in him we live, and move, and have our being.&quot;—Acts 17: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The great Fountain of life has set up righteous standards and requirements for all who would forever drink of the water of life in the new world. Amidst this wicked world now bleeding profusely from the wounds of its global war is it possible for any man, woman or child to measure up to those divine standards and requirements? The totalitarian aggressors have been crowding all other nations, and the nations that seek to preserve their way of life are being pushed into regimentation of their peoples. They try to outdo the totalitarian powers in efficiency. Under such world pressure is it humanly possible for you to fulfill what the great Life-giver requires of man to enjoy life, liberty and security in a free world of righteousness? God’s own Word an-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Who will live in the new world, and what kind of experience will Jehovah make living then?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2 . Because of what \ital relations of Jeho&gt;ah to the new world should those desiring life gain knowledge of Him and act on it*</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3 Under present world conditior«. what questions come up as to God's standards and requirements, and v.bj is the lote of righteousness necessary? </span><span class="font4">swers yes; and he would not require of his creatures the impossible for them. “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.” (Ps. 103:13,14) In his standards and requirements, however, God does not compromise with iniquity or wickedness. Hence, to meet what God calls for in those whom he approves for life and blessings, one must have first a love of righteousness or that which is right.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* In trying to measure up to God’s standards you may expect, and his Word forewarns you, that the world and its backers will try to discourage you, and then to oppose you, and finally to punish and make you suffer for walking the way that Jehovah God marks out. They are not your true friends and benefactors in so doing, but are the dupes and tools of the demons under the prince of demons, Satan, “the god of this world.” Bear in mind that none of these would-be friends can give you everlasting life; none can preserve your life through the coming battle of Armageddon, with which this world is sure to end, and bear you safely into the new world conditions on earth. Men may kill the body, but none of those who oppose God’s standards and requirements can raise the dead to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Remember, too, that faithful men of God in times past, under conditions just as trying to them as your conditions today, remained true and steadfast to the hope of God’s kingdom, and triumphed over the world and won divine approval. By God’s grace, which was sufficient for them, you too can overcome this world and its death-dealing course and win the prize of life in perfect conditions. His grace does not fail his servants in this “modern” age of “science falsely so called”. It merely requires faith to trust him for his grace, if you choose to walk in his paths and to endure the disapproval and opposition of this world. “For whatsoever is bom of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4 . What may one now expect when trying to meet God’s standards, and what should one bear in mind concerning those who oppose Gods standards and requirements ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5 What should one remember concerning the faithful men of God In times past? and bow can one also overcome as they did?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?” (1 John 5: 4, 5) No one endured more from the world under demon control than this One, who is “the way, and the truth, and the life”; and he said to those who would follow him: “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16: 33) Believing and following him, you are sure to overcome also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Now is a faith-testing time, because it is a day of great deception. Men, not merely religious leaders, but politicians and world statesmen and also business and economic strategists, make promises of a “better world”. They assume to undertake and to bring about on earth that which Jehovah God has assigned to Christ Jesus to do and which God’s Word promises that only his Son can and will do. Thereby such religious, political, commercial men put themselves in the role of Christ, anointing themselves or other men to the mighty task of world reconstruction, apart from the direct intervention of Jesus Christ. They make glowing prophecies of what they, with the people’s abject submission and co-operation, shall accomplish through their humanly devised schemes. Although they oil their proposals with a lot of pious phrases to sound religious, yet their programs for a postwar world do not take into consideration Jehovah’s purpose expressed in his written Word, nor his standards and requirements for life and good in the new world. Can such religious, political and economic programs have God’s blessing and backing? No; but it behooves the lovers of life and righteousness to hearken to the words of Jehovah’s great Prophet concerning the “end of the world”: “For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.” (Mark 13: 22, 23) That warning will not be lost on God’s elect today, nor upon those who now associate with the elect at this end of the old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE “ELECT” AND THEIR COMPANIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The true Christ prophetically warns of the appearance of men, particularly of organizations of men, who try to run ahead of the Son of God. These offer themselves as substitutes for Jesus, as if fully qualified and competent to fulfill the prophecies of the new world, and thus try to forestall the real work of Christ the King. Say they, God helps those who help themselves; and so they set aside Christ Jesus and his thousand-year reign as unnecessary. They claim that men, with the help of religion, are able to create with their own hands a world that will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">C. Because of what role assumed by worldly leaders is this a faithtesting time’ and therefore what warning of Jesus about the end of the world should we now heed ?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">7. What do such worldly men try to do as respects Christ’s work’ and whose prophecies should you believe, theirs or those of God’s Word? </span><span class="font4">suitable to human needs and enjoyment. Whose prophecies will you believe, theirs or those of Jehovah’s Word? The “elect” and their companions on earth will put faith in the unfailing Word of God and will strive to obey and follow His word rather than man’s. This is their defense against world deception, and no coercion from the world will succeed in breaking their faith.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Jesus’ long-range prophecy shows that at the end of the world there would be on earth a remnant of the elect. These are not the elect of any democratic nation holding popular elections, nor the elect of the postwar world in which it is proposed that the people shall be permitted to choose their own form of government and way of life. These “elect” are not the hand-picked men of political parties or bosses, but are selected by God, according to his will. During the nineteen centuries since the death and resurrection of his faithful Son Jehovah God has been selecting these “elect”. “Elect” for what? For the absolutely perfect and righteous Government that the Originator of all righteous and valid government promised to set up over this earth and all the rest of his universe. It is his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, the “Seed” that shall bruise the Serpent’s head. (Gen. 3: 15) Christ Jesus is the first and Chief One of the “elect” of God. (Isa. 42:1) He is the perfect exemplification of the standards and requirements for anyone to be of that select governmental body, Jehovah’s capital organization. God foreknew and predestinated the formation of such a governmental body under his King Christ Jesus; and “whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren”.—Rom. 8: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The perfect standard set by the Royal Head of that capital organization, and the care and the centuries of time which Jehovah God has occupied to elect and develop those to be forever associated with his Son in the righteous rule over earth and all creation, prove that The Theocratic Government will be the ideal and only adequate government. It will be fully able to cope with all human problems and difficulties, to banish the terrible, worrisome chaos and to establish perfect, peace-promoting order, and to fill the earth with freedom, plenty and joyous living for all obedient humankind. All man-made governments of whatever political style, past, present and postwar, have proved and will prove hopelessly futile. After this total war man’s greatest governmental experiment will be made. But disappointment will follow upon it as but an “hour” afterward, and then total world destruction. Not all</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">8. Who are the “elect” that are not deceived, and for what are they “elect”, and how predestinated?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9. How will The Theocracy be the Ideal and adequate government over men. and oa between it and man’s postwar government experiment what course should one now take ’ </span><span class="font4">the religion in the world will be able to save it from that fate. (1 Thess. 5:3; Rev. 17:12) Why foolishly be dragged into that destruction? Believe God’s Word, and turn now with faith and hope to his Theocratic Government under Christ, which is at hand. Subject yourself to it now, and prepare yourself for the grand success of that Government, with life and lasting benefits to result therefrom in the New World of righteousness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> One of the “elect”, the apostle Peter, writes to his fellow “elect” ones, and God Almighty has preserved the inspired writing for our information, guidance and encouragement today. The “elect” are strangers to this world, but are friends and citizens of the New World. (1 Pet. 1: 1,2) Many thousands of persons of good-will toward God and his promised Kingdom are now becoming loyal companions of the remnant of the “elect” company. All the efforts of this world and its religious and political officials and henchmen have failed to wipe out the line of this developing “elect” company, down to this “last time”; just as they failed to wipe out the still longer line of Jehovah’s witnesses from Abel’s day down to this. Why? Because God’s “elect” are “kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time”.—1 Pet. 1:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> What though the manifold trials and tests of integrity toward God and his kingdom are increasing due to the spread of the totalitarian spirit, method and rule, this is the due season for rejoicing, because now is “the last time” of Satan’s rule. The heaviness due to the trials should not crush the spirit of rejoicing; for the sure means of deliverance and salvation is at hand, Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by his perfect Governor, Christ Jesus. To meet his approval means salvation. ‘Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.”—1 Pet. 1:6-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Far be it from anyone therefore to now deceive himself. The god of this old world may be expected to increase the fiery trial, like heating the furnace seven times as hot for the three Jehovah’s witnesses who refused to bow down to King Nebuchadnezzar’s gold image when the band played. But just as in that</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10 . What is the relationship of these ‘'elect” toward the old and the new world, and why have all efforts to wipe them out failed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">11 Why are the trials and tests of today, and why should not the heaviness due thereto crush out the spirit of rejoicing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">12 What may we expect as to the further part of the fiery trial? and where do we get the right answer as to which course under trial brings the desirable end? </span><span class="font4">ahcient day, so now the Son of God, even the King Christ Jesus, has come to the temple for judgment, and he is with the approved “elect” ones and their companions in the fiery furnace. He will defeat the consuming power of the flames of fiery persecution at the hands of religion and state, and will preserve the faithful and bring them forth to honorable service in the New World. (Dan. 3:1-30) Religion and the state, which have thrown Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions into the fire to destroy their integrity and worthiness of life eternal, will suffer the consequences of their ungodly course and will be destroyed in the fire of the battle of Armageddon. Which course, then, brings the desirable end, the course of challenging the world and its totalitarian demands and doing so out of faithfulness to Jehovah God and his standard of righteousness or the course of weakly conforming to the world’s ways and demands and obeying men rather than God so as to avoid the fiery trial? The divine record of the past shows the right answer. Soon, God’s preservation of the remnant of his “elect” and their faithful companions clear through the tribulation of Armageddon, and the utter destruction of the persecutors and opposers there, will provide a final and climactic answer.—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITY, HOW GAINED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, is now gathering his “other sheep” to the side of the New World and is making them the companions of the remnant of the “little flock”. (John 10:16) Therefore the words of Peter concerning God’s standards and life requirements now apply to both the remnant and their loving companions under the one Shepherd’s care. “Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:8,9) In a world disunited by religious and political disagreements to the point of total war, how strange the inspired words of Peter sound! and how apparently impossible of fulfilling by anyone now and in the postwar world! Yet there is a minority on earth who have observed and will further observe these God-given instructions. And it is to such, and not to the world or to the religionists of “Christendom”, that these words are directed. Such ones are those who are in a covenant with Jehovah God to do his will, as Christ Jeans did God’s will concerning him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; “Christendom,” so called, is religiously divided into hundreds of cults and sects. Moreover, the reli-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">13 . To whom do Peter’s words concerning God's life requirements now apply, and who observes them and will continue to do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14 What is the condition of &quot;Christendom” as compared with Peter's instructions to ‘be all of one mind’, etc., and wbat is the declared purpose of the Nail dictator in that regard ? </span><span class="font4">gionists permit the politics of this world to divide them further and to cause members to hate other members of their own sect. It is well-known history that for centuries the Roman Catholic sect used the political arm of the state to wipe out murderously those whom that mighty sect terms “religious heretics”. The gory Thirty Years’ War, of 1618-1648, is an outstanding example of this. Now a son of that sect, the Nazi dictator of Germany, has declared that he will wipe out the effects of that war, which resulted in the toleration of religious disunity of “Christendom”. He has declared that he will force the United Nations to sign the peace treaty at the same place, in Westphalia, where the Roman Catholic forces were obliged to sign the treaty of peace and of religious tolerance in 1648, contrary to the pope’s wishes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” What is the purpose of the totalitarian dictators, whose concordats with the Vatican the pope refuses to cancel? It is to overthrow this religious disunity of “Christendom” and to bring the world to oneness of mind under the religious dominance of the Vatican. by force of arms, if not by propaganda suasion. The Fascist dictator at Rome, who is the Vatican’s next-door neighbor, showed no compassion upon the Coptic religionists of Ethiopia, in 1935 and since. The Nazi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fuehrer,</span><span class="font4"> whose way to power was paved by the present pope, has shown no pity to Jehovah’s witnesses and to the Jews in Germany and in the conquered territories. And the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of America and their religious and pseudo-patriotic henchmen have manifested no courtesy, pity or compassion to Jehovah’s witnesses in the “land of the free”. For what reason? Because the witnesses are the strongest and the only uncompromising barrier to the unification of the peoples of America and all other lands with the religious head of Vatican City. The expressly declared purpose of that religious sect and its Nazi-Fascist “sword” is to Catholicize America and the British Commonwealth and all the earth and thereby make it “of one mind” Catholically under the self-styled “successor of Peter”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Such is not the oneness of mind, and the way to attain it, as counseled by the apostle Peter. On the night of Jesus’ betrayal and arrest Peter heard him pray for the unity of his followers, saying: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15 . Whit then, is the purpose of the totalitarian dictators, and why do they and the Hierarchy show no pity or courtesy to Jehovah's witnesses in any country?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">16 When did Christ Jesus expressly pray for the unity of his followers, and is the abote the way to attain the oneness of mind? </span><span class="font4">be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.”—John 17:16,17, 19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> It is the truth, mixed -with the love of the truth, that brings Jesus’ followers to a oneness of mind; and that truth is found in Jehovah’s Word, the Bible. Religion divides the people into sects, because religion is the product of the demons under Satan their chief. There is only one thing that brings unity into the understanding of the Bible, and that is the discernment of Almighty God’s purpose to establish his kingdom by Christ Jesus and to vindicate his name by it. There is only one thing around which to unite in oneness of mind; that is The Theocracy of Jehovah God through his Son, the King. There is only one people where today such unity of mind prevails; it is Jehovah’s people upon whom his name is called, namely, his witnesses. Those composing Jehovah’s witnesses have come out from all religious sects, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and heathenish, as well as from all nationalities; but they are now all of one mind, because they have consecrated themselves wholly to Jehovah God and rally about his Theocratic Government. “Angels and authorities and powers” in the heavens must unitedly be subject to that Government; and all persons on earth, no matter of what nationality, are all of one blood and must be subject to that one Government, if they would survive and gain life in the New World and enjoy its peace and prosperity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Being all thus of one mind, the “elect” remnant and their companions can appreciate one another’s devotion to God and the Kingdom, and their relationship to one another, and also the like position of each one in this hostile world. For their common devotion to God and his King they love one another They express this love by unselfishly aiding one another to serve God and to keep covenant with Him and to have a part in the vindication of His name, and to so gain salvation to endless life. They are compassionate or sympathetic toward one another in their difficulties and in their efforts to keep their integrity to God despite trials. They love one another, not according to mere fleshly attachments, but as brethren in the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Having themselves received of the mercy of God and tasted of the pity of Christ Jesus their King and Redeemer, they display this God-like quality to one</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">17 How are oneness of mind and unity of understanding brought about and where or among whom do such things exist today’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">18 How do they “love as brethren&quot;, “having compassion one of another'*’ 19. How do they fulfill the instructions to “be pitiful, be courteous&quot;’ </span><span class="font4">another and are pitiful, and forgive one another rather than take personal offense. They are humble-minded, having this same mind which was also in Christ Jesus, and do not seek to exalt themselves one above the other in order to shine and wield authority above others. They are courteous, and hence considerate, treating one another with due regard as being servants of Jehovah God. They show this same courteousness when they go from house to house bearing witness to the people concerning God’s kingdom. Thereby they do not permit selfish personal matters to cause dissensions among them and to take their minds off God’s kingdom and its service.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The Devil is bent on turning every creature on earth against Jehovah God and his Government of life and blessing. The remnant is the focus of his combined attack. Hence he seeks to disturb and destroy their oneness, and to break off their wholeness of devotion and dedication to God and his kingdom. He causes those of this world who are filled with his spirit to render evil undeservedly to Jehovah’s witnesses and to rail against them, even to doing violence to them and mobbing them and throwing them into concentration camps and prisons, falsely accusing them as wrongdoers, chiding and reviling them with words that pierce like swords, and ruling that they are an “illegal organization’’, “outlaws,” and a “menace to the state ”. At such wrongful treatment from the world the “elect” remnant and their companions do not permit Satan to enter their hearts and to induce them to return evil for evil. Their desire is not for revenge, in a spirit of bitterness, because they know that vengeance belongs to Jehovah God and he 'will surely repay those that do evil, calling every such one to full account. Their “appeal to Caesar”, like that of the apostle Paul, is to have the evildoers restrained from interfering with the worship and service of Jehovah God by the nation’s own legal, constitutional and police arrangements for maintaining order and right-doing among citizens. Their fight is not with fellow men, but with the demons who have caused and try to continue the darkness of this world. (Eph. 6:12) Hence their weapons are not carnal. Carnal weapons can never destroy the demons or their doctrines of darkness. The Christian’s weapons are those of the light of truth, and are ‘mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds of error'.—2 Cor. 10:3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> When persecuted, reviled and evil entreated, they give “contrariwise, blessing”. Not that they say “God bless you” to those who wrongfully abuse them. Instead, they take the course which should result in a blessing and lead to repentance anyone who mis-</span></p></li></ul>

(b) Why are they “not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing”, and what, then is the purpose of their course’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">treats them under instigation of the religious leaders and the demons but who is misinformed and not malicious. That is, they show forth an example of loyalty and faithfulness to the Most High God and Christ Jesus. They do not permit the mistreatment to take their minds off the Kingdom and its service, but warn the ignorant of their course of opposition. Then, by continuing to preach the Kingdom gospel, they seek to enlighten the minds of the misguided but honest opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“HE THAT WILL LOVE LIFE”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Certain knowledge helps the mistreated Christian to take the course looking to the eventual good of the misinstructed one. “Knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9) Being called to gain divine blessings both now and in the New World when in full operation, they seek to be a blessing to others. If they sought to do injury and cause damage to others, they would be disobeying God’s commandments, not meeting his standards, and hence would fail to receive the blessing to which called. “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue [pursue] it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” (1 Pet. 3: 10-12) This rule applied to Christ Jesus in his love of life and desire to see many and good days, because here the apostle Peter was quoting from Psalm 34, verses 12-16, and verse 20 of this Psalm reads: “He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.” The apostle John, as eyewitness, bears testimony to the fact that this prophecy of Psalm 34 was specifically fulfilled upon Jesus when he died. The soldiers broke the bones of the two crucified thieves, but not those of Jesus, although the religious clergy requested it. (John 19:31-37) Likewise all followers of Christ Jesus love life. That is why they do not abuse life. They love the great Lifegiver, and also his Son, by whom He gives life to the redeemed ones. So they follow the Son's course of obedience to God’s law, that through him they might gain eternal life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The above requirements for life must be met even under provocation from railers, evildoers and persecutors. When the psalmist David composed Psalm 34 under inspiration, he was declared an outlaw by religious King Saul and his operations in Israel were declared “illegal”, and all who helped</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">22. (a) What dees knowing chat they were called to Inherit a blessing help them to do to persecutors, and what requirements for life does this course meet? (b) Ilow does Psalm 34 show to whom the rule above applies, and how do Christ’s followers accordingly chow their love of life’ 23. How does the course of the writer of Psalm 34 show that the life requirements must be met under proxocation and that meeting them does result in deliverance and life’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">David were declared guilty of treason and were killed. David was obliged to find refuge with the Philistines at the city of Gath, and from there work his way back into the land of Israel. (1 Samuel 21 and 22) Never did the hounded David rail at his demonized persecutor. Not once did he repay King Saul evil for evil, even when it was twice within his power to kill Saul when urged to do so in selfdefense. (1 Samuel 24 and 26) Yet for all this David was eventually delivered and came to the throne, whereas the violent religionist Saul, though king of the country, was killed by his own sword with which he had tried to kill the outlawed David. The eyes of Jehovah were fixed with approval upon David though the law of the land pronounced him “illegal'’ as if ‘seeking to take over the government of Israel himself. God's ears were open to David’s cries and prayers for help, but Jehovah’s face was against the religious ruler who did evil against the Lord’s anointed one. David was a type primarily of Christ Jesus, and also of his followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">** Considering David’s course and the outcome thereof, and considering David’s words of Psalm 34 as an observation thereon, the apostle Peter asks: “And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?” (1 Pet. 3:13) Jealous, malicious-minded Saul tried to harm David. The demons were using Saul because David had been anointed by God’s prophet to be the king of His typical Theocracy over Israel. The demons sought to provoke David and to fill him with bitterness against God, who permitted Saul’s persecution. They sought to make David lose faith in God and his purpose and in his faithfulness to his promise, and thus cause David to break his integrity to God and prove unworthy of the kingship and so defeat God’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Demonized Saul and his demon masters proved unable to harm David, though they caused him a lot of hardship, dangers and trials. Their fight against God ended with defeat, defeat of persecution. Why so? Because David kept on following that which is good and did not turn aside from faith in God and service to Him. David waited upon God for His time to fulfill his promise and purpose. This is an example for those who today follow the Greater David, Christ Jesus, imitating Him. “And who is he that will injure you. if you become imitators of the good one?” (1 Pet. 3: 13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott;</span><span class="font4"> also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young’s</span><span class="font4"> translation) The imitator of Jesus must persist in being true and without guile in his consecration to God. He must be faithful to God and his law and thereby maintain his integrity toward God unbroken. Then, regardless of what bodily or property damages the enemies may inflict, they cannot harm his standing</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">24. Who incited King Saul to try to harm David, and why’ 25 (a) Why did the persecutors prove unable to harm David, and for whom it David’s course an example today? (b) How do these follow **that which is good” and “the good one' and thereby escape harm? </span><span class="font4">and his unity with God and Christ or his life interests in the New World. Hence Jesus said: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10: 2S) Jehovah’s witnesses continue to imitate Christ Jesus in preaching the gospel from house to house and place to place, regardless of their so-called “legal standing” with the world. They know that Jesus' example, though “illegal”, is the only good one, and the imitation of Him is the only safe course. To continue safe from real harm they must be faithful unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HAPPY, FEARLESS, AND OF GOOD CONSCIENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Yes, there are and will be sufferings connected with this course, because we are not better than the One we imitate. “But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation [conduct] in Christ.” (1 Pet. 3:14-16) The 6,000 Jehovah’s witnesses who have suffered in Naziland’s prisons and concentration camps ever since Hitler’s concordat with the pope in July, 1933, are nevertheless “happy”, that is, “blessed,” and have an irremovable joy in their hearts. 'Why? Because they “suffer for righteousness’ sake”. Rather than salute the swastika and heil Hitler as their leader they choose to endure unspeakable mistreatment for the righteous cause of keeping Jehovah God’s commandments and upholding His exclusive right to their worship, service and unquestioning obedience. Their blessedness agrees with that described by Jesus in his sermon on the mount.—Matt. 5:1-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2T</sup> All of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in other lands, who suffer like things because of keeping their agreement with Jehovah and obeying his righteous commandments to declare his name and kingdom throughout the earth, are likewise “blessed”. God’s Word assures them, yea, they have the inward conviction, that they have His approval. Hence their joy of heart no man can take away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> In the midst of the present frightful conditions those who put their confidence in Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government are not disturbed or afraid. However, it is increasingly manifest from the physical facts that all nations stand in fear of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2fl Why &lt;Jo the faithful Jehovah’s witnesses In Nazi Germany “suffer for righteousness* sake”, and are they “happy<sup>1</sup>' therefor ’ 27. Why are their brethren In other lands likewise &quot;blessed&quot; 28 Amid the (rightful conditions who. then, are the ones in fear, how do they show it, and at what price to the peoples interests? </span><span class="font4">the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and therefore try to ■urry favor with it and to compromise with it. Thereby they play into the hands of the Vatican politicians in their audacious, selfish scheme to establish papal control over the entire earth and to banish the Kingdom truth and the worship and service of Jehovah from the earth. The Vatican has promoted totalitarianism of the Nazi and Fascist brands. It conspires with these forms of Catholic Action to further its scheme of making all nations in effect kiss the pope’s toe. These totalitarian forms of Catholic Action have frightened the other nations, which nations are further hampered by the presence of influential agents and action groups of the Vatican and by the crafty work of the religious “fifth column”. Hence, to secure a measure of unity on the home front, the political element are obliged to dicker with the diplomatists of the Vatican, as if the ruler of the Vatican were a supernational universal ruler and had vested rights and exclusive privileges and interests in every nation on earth. The price of striking a bargain with that religion-camouflaged political organization is a damage to democratic government, a curtailment of the people’s rights, and an encroachment by the religious Hierarchy upon the freedom of the state and the liberties of the citizens to hear and learn the truth and to worship God according to His commandments and the dictates of their private consciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Thus the Hierarchy spider weaves a net about the political and commercial elements and also about the non-protesting “Protestant” and Jewish religionists. It holds them fast in its conspiracy against Jehovah’s truth and His rule of the earth by Christ Jesus. Then the “spider” bleeds them of their vitality of independent action for righteousness. The facts in all parts of the globe for years have shown a steady progression in the suppression of Jehovah’s message of The Theocracy in one country after another, including most recently of all Great Britain itself. This proves there is a world-wide conspiracy against the truth, the Kingdom truth. Who is back of this concerted moving in from circumference to center to finally crush Jehovah’s proclaimed message? It is the demons under Satan, who are the relentless foes of Jehovah and his King; and the demons, as always in the past, use religion as their chief instrument. They now use the religious organization of world-wide growth and which, like a gigantic devilfish, has the suckers of its tentacles on all the nations of the earth. By this religious system the wicked spirits draw all nations irresistibly into the plot against the truth which makes men free and igainst the Kingdom which vindicates God’s holy name and brings deliverance, life and freedom to</span></p>

(a) What proof is there of a worldwide conspiracy against King-lom truth’ (b) Who js back of it, and when will it come to the surface? </span><span class="font4">humankind. Such international political-religious conspiracy is against that which is for the glory of God and the people’s highest interests. It will come to the surface in the arrangements of the postwar “new order”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” By this conspiracy against truth and righteousness the demons terrorize the earth. All men, the rulers and the ruled, stand in fear of this organized conspiracy and its power. They are troubled at it, and are afraid to strike for freedom from the demons and the power of religion, afraid to line up on the side of Jehovah’s Holy Government now at hand. They are fearful to speak boldly the truth themselves or to permit the truth to be spoken by Jehovah’s witnesses. They sanctify religion in their lives and policies, and then fight for religion, but against God and his King and worshipers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Shall the target of their concerted attack, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, fear this terrible conspiracy? “Be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.” How may Jehovah’s witnesses and all persons of good-will do this? Peter, rather the Lord God who inspired him, answers: “Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.” That means, renounce religion as unholy demonism; declare the Lord God Jehovah as the Holy One; set him apart in your hearts and affections as the Holy One and as the One to be worshiped and feared. He is the Almighty God and the Creator. All the nations under demon rule are but as a drop in the bucket or the fine dust on the scale pan in comparison with Jehovah, who will puff the opposing nations away at Armageddon. He will be a terror to them and will trouble them before their destruction. With invincible power He will protect and preserve all who fear him with godly fear, being anxious always to please him by obeying him rather than men. It is His truth that sanctifies. It is the truth concerning Jehovah that enables us to sanctify Him in our hearts, and to put out of our hearts religion, which is a friend to this world and a part of it. Religion is therefore unholy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The earliest Greek manuscripts now available read: “But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord.” (1 Pet. 3: 15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.; Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> That is to say, cleanse your hearts from fear of men and demons, and acknowledge in your hearts that the Anointed King, Jehovah’s Son, is the Lord: “But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.” (1 Cor. 8:6) Those desiring life must set affection upon Christ Jesus as Lord, God’s Beloved One, because he is the One who bought us with the sacrifice<sup>1</sup> of himself and who is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">30 How doe&lt; the fear of this conspiracy affect the rulers and the ruled, and what therefore do they sanctify in their hearts’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">31 How do Jehovah’s witnesses fulfill the instruction, “Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts'*’ and why so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">32 Since the oldest manuscripts read, “But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord.&quot; how do we do that, and what does this displace’ </span><span class="font4">therefore our Owner and Master. We are no more our own. Hence we cannot be the servants of men. We must obey the commandments and example of our Lord, with loving devotion to him as Jehovah’s King. We may not fear other creatures, even when the whole world is combined in conspiracy against Christ’s reigning over earth as King. Sanctify him in the vital part of you, in the heart, as being Jehovah’s Executioner with all power in heaven and earth to destroy the demons and the religious, political, commercial conspirators at Armageddon. Such sanctification of the Lord will displace all fear of the terror which those wicked creatures have made in order to dominate the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“READY ALWAYS FOR DEFENSE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” God's unerring rule is that what is in the heart must be made manifest, if not by express word of mouth, then by course of action, which speaks louder than words. Thus, “the fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14:1) The rulers of earth and their supporters are so saying in their hearts. It is betrayed by their overt acts of conspiracy against Jehovah and his Kingdom and the message thereof. Likewise, the sanctification of Jehovah as Lord God and of Christ Jesus as “Lord of lords” in our heart must become known openly. How? By activity as a witness for Jehovah God and the Righteous Government under Iris Son, Christ Jesus our Lord. “Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear [reverence].” Or, better translated from the Greek: “Be ready always for defense to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you. with meekness and fear.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Young’s; Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup>‘ The Christian’s hope is in Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. Before anyone will ask the reason or explanatory account for such hope, that Christian must first have been active in fulfillment of his anointing or commission to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. His activity in field service; his obedience to God rather than men when there is a clash between the laws of God and those of “Caesar”; his refusal to conform himself to this world and its political, commercial, religious schemes; this is what provokes the demand in court or the request in private homes or prison for an account of one’s faith and one’s relationship with God, inducing one to such conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Every man within possible reach of the witness for God has a right to the opportunity to ask and hear, and that of the witness himself. It is out of order with God’s law and his direct command to his</span></p>

In tins regard, to what do the people have a right, and what Is it contrary to God’s law for organisations and authorities to do? </span><span class="font4">servants when religious sects, political governments and judicial courts conspire and rule that the ambassadors of God’s kingdom must be restrained from preaching freely the gospel. Thereby the people in general are deprived of their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font4"> and privilege to hear the message of hope and salvation. (Mal. 3: 5) It is criminal before God for worldly authorities to declare it “illegal” for Jehovah’s witnesses to speak to others in explanation of their hope of God’s kingdom and its blessings for obedient men.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Everywhere the witnesses of the Most High God are under attacks stirred up by religionists. Hence the people are perplexed, and of inquiring mind. It is due them that they have the opportunity to learn the facts by the visits to their homes of the ones under attack. Jehovah’s witnesses have a right to make a defense, and that to the entire world which is opposed. It is not proselyting for them to spread abroad the explanation of their glorious hope, but is in “defence of the gospel” which is under assault and misrepresentation. Such published account of their Scriptural hope is to the highest interest of the people. The salvation of individuals to life eternal is at stake, and the opportunity should be afforded each person to choose intelligently the hope and way of salvation. It is neither in accord with right nor in accord with the blatantly proclaimed “freedoms” which are promised an unhindered operation in the postwar arrangement, when political bodies, sustained by courts, legislate to suppress the “defense” of the truth, to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3T</sup> The servants of the Almighty and Supreme One have his commandments as to what to do continuously. His supreme commandments they will obey. They have sanctified the Lord God in their hearts by a full consecration of themselves to him. Daily, in whatever land, under whatever human laws, they will be ready and prepared to explain their hope to humankind in its hopeless condition. No legislation or arrangements of men can alter that obligation upon God’s consecrated people. To declare “illegal” or to subject to purchase by license fees what the Creator commands his devoted creatures to do is to fight against God; and to obey such human ordinances leads to destruction. When haled into courts because of ignoring such ordinances as not applying to them, they will not consider themselves as guilty of criminal disobedience. No, but there also in court they will obey God’s command and be ready and prepared to give a defense on the witness stand, a defense of their hope and their obedience to that hope. Christ Jesus so commanded them to do. (Luke 12: 11; 21: 14) He himself did so before Pontius Pilate. (John 18:36, 37; 1 Tim. 6: 6,13) His faithful apostles did likewise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">36 Why Is it due, richt and of public interest for Jehovah's witnesses to be let make a defense ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">37 . For what, therefore, will the Lord's servants always be ready, and where and why will they render it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(Acts 22:1; 24:10; 25: 8,16; 26:1,2,24) “So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. And I will walk at liberty [at large; from house to house]: for I seek thy precepts. I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.” —Ps. 119:44-46.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> Those under command to bear God’s testimonies may, therefore, not be “legally” restricted by men. They have a right to access to the people. The people have a God-given right to hear and receive the message of hope at the lips and the hands of the witnesses of the Lord God, for God has sent forth the message that it might be freely given to the people. “Freely ye have received; freely give”; and that could not mean being subject to a license tax or a declaration of illegality by a government of religion-blinded men. The world is in its most deplorable condition, and the distressed people need comfort. Religion fails to give them that. The nations under guidance of their religious advisers have forgotten Jehovah. The demons have invaded the nations and have approached the rulers thereof and are marching the nations to their “hell” at Armageddon, in the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. (Ps. 9: 17; Rev. 16:14-16) All those who are being regimented by the nations gone totalitarian are in danger of the “sword” of Jehovah's Executioner in that battle, which will wipe out the total world. God’s witnesses have been made his “watchman” to give the people warning from Him. For the watchman to draw back in fear or to willfully neglect or fail to sound the warning loud and unmistakably would be criminal negligence on his part in God’s sight. It would be disobedience to his commission from Jehovah God and would merit his own destruction. Wherefore Jehovah’s witnesses are bound to be “ready always” to offer warning testimony to the endangered ones and to point to the hope of life in the New World of Jehovah's creation.—Ezek. 3: 17-21; 33:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> They follow in the footsteps of Jehovah’s Chief Witness, who said of himself: “I am meek and lowly in heart.” (Matt. 11:29) Hence, not in fanaticism, not in the self-conceited spirit of “I am right and you are wrong”, not in a threatening and coercive way, but in the meekness of Christ Jesus and in fear of God, they go to the people. They are commissioned to &quot;comfort all that mourn&quot;, and to sound the Lord’s warning to “seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be that ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger”. (Zeph. 2: 3) They do not rail at the “goats” or willful opposers, but refrain their tongues from evil, and their lips that they speak no guile. They</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">39 In what manner of spirit do they make this answer or defense, and therefore to whom do the* pnnianly demote their attention? </span><span class="font4">seek no quarrel or fight with the “goats”, but “eschew •evil, and do good”, and “seek peace, and ensue it”. They are not disturbers of the peace and good order of any community. They waste no time or words on the “goats”, but turn from them to the search and hunt for the “sheep”, those who “will love life, and see good days”. They know the Good Shepherd is now gathering his “other sheep”. They are with the Shepherd in his objective, and hence they gather with him the scattered sheep. (Matt. 12:30) When the state and its courts and law officers ban the assembling of his “sheep” and use their power to hinder and prevent the gathering of the sheep, they are scattering and are against Christ Jesus. On them the Shepherd will use his rod; but it will be a “rod of iron”, to destroy them at Armageddon.—Ps. 2: S, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> The vast majority speak evil of Jehovah’s witnesses because they obey God rather than man’s prohibitions and restrictions on God’s witness work. Judges, police magistrates, lawmakers, and ministers of “justice” condemn them and their message and their method of delivering it. Does this hurt the consciences of Jehovah’s covenant-people? No; not because Jehovah’s servants are conscienceless, but because they act in all good conscience, “having a good conscience.” It is not a religious conscience, such as permits religionists to reproach Jehovah’s name and persecute his people, even killing them, thinking that so they have religiously done God a service. (John 16:1-3) It is a “good conscience”, for it is an enlightened conscience, instructed according to the Word of God, which is good.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; “Conscience” means, according to the Greek, “knowledge with oneself.” Jehovah’s witnesses are taught in the law of God, and when they keep his perfect law in the face of contrary laws of demonized men, their conscience does not accuse them, but they have the knowledge within themselves, the inward realization, that they have obeyed God’s law and have His approval and hence have not sinned. If they suffer for keeping their conscience clear before God, then they remember 1 Peter 2:19, reading: “For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>&lt;!</sup> So continuing in spite of false accusation, those who “love life” will in God’s due time see their course transpire to the light as good, right and approved. They shall realize life in the new world and see good days there. Those, however, who have spoken and acted and legislated against Jehovah’s faithful servants will be ashamed, even they “that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE SERVICE MUST GO ON</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font3">HEN a man is justified by his Creator, Jehovah God, that means he has a right to live as a human creature. He is a free man then. However, now that he has agreed to do the will of God by making a consecration to Him, whatsoever that will might be, the man thereby makes himself the voluntary bond-servant of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus. He becomes the servant of Christ, because Christ Jesus is his Head; and he also becomes the bond-servant of God, because God is the Head of Christ.—1 Cor. 7:22,23; 11:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a Son of God, clothed with full right and authority to represent his Father, and as a bond-servant, Jesus stood before Governor Pilate. Asked whether he was a king, he said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) He thus testified that his chief purpose on earth was to be Jehovah's witness and that those who would hear and obey his voice would likewise be of the truth and be witnesses of the truth. During his several years’ work as a bond-servant of God he gave witness to the truth. He gave this witness by the course he took, that is, by his words, by his life, and by his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A servant must be humble. This means one must be wholly and completely submissive to the will of his master. Jesus was fully submissive to his Father’s will. He did not seek to exalt himself at any time. Had he attempted self-exaltation he would have violated his covenant with God. It was the covenant purpose of Jehovah to make Jesus the Author of eternal salvation to all who believe, and to make him the Head of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s will was that before giving to his beloved Son such great honor, his Son must by performing the duties of a servant prove his loyalty under the most adverse conditions. This entailed upon him suffering. “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. 5: 8, 9) That suffering was not for the purpose of so-called “character development”, but was for the purpose of demonstrating Jesus’ loyalty while acting in the capacity of a bond-servant. Thereby he proved he would be loyal when exalted to the highest place in God’s universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What was the purpose of God in causing to be made the specific record of the course of his beloved Son as a bond-servant on earth? In order that those who would maintain their integrity toward God and have part in the vindication of God’s name might know what is required of them. If God would require his beloved Son to become a bond-servant and to prove his loyalty and integrity under adverse conditions in order to be exalted to the Kingdom, then, for stronger reasons, would God require all others who would share with his Son in the glory of the Kingdom to prove their faithfulness and integrity under adverse conditions. These also must become bond-slaves and fully perform the duties laid upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some who have for some time been acquainted with the Kingdom truth have overlooked the most important things required of a Christian. They seem to think that God is working hard to get them beautifully developed, in order to take them to heaven. They acquire the thought that all the Lord requires of them is to profess to be a Christian, then meditate upon some part of his Word, and dream about how wonderful it will be for them to be in heaven. Such ones do not stop to consider the obligation that must be performed by the bond-servant of Jehovah God. All who are begotten of God’s life-giving power and anointed with his spirit are sons of God, and such ones are called to life divine reserved for the faithful ones in heaven. Besides that, they are also called to something else now; what? “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2:21) Hence, while such may be sons, they must also be bond-servants, even as Jesus was a Son of God and a servant at the same time. In no other way could one follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. As a bond-servant the will of the Christian must be to do the will of God. As Jesus said, so must his disciple say: “Of mine own self I can do nothing.” The picture of the boring of a devoted servant’s ear with an awl, as described at Deuteronomy 15:16,17, now applies to Jesus’ disciples. Symbolically such ones say: ‘By my consecration to God I have agreed to be the bond-servant of my Master, voluntarily and for ever.’ As such servant he must do Jehoi ah’s expressed will. Then, though the doing of God’s will causes him suffering in the flesh or suffering to his feelings, he must perform his covenant and go on with his service to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What would deter anyone from doing God’s will when the doing thereof would bring mental or physical suffering upon him? The answer is found in one word, Selfishness. Selfishness is the very opposite of love. Love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. Said Jesus: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (John 14:15) The keeping of the commandments by the bond-servant, under the terms of his vow of consecration, is a condition precedent to having the Lord’s approval. “If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.” (John 14:23-25) There Jesus was laying down the rules that must govern all who become a part of God’s servant class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The proper course of a Christian, therefore, is to ascertain what are the commandments of God concerning him, and then do those commandments and do them joyfully. The commandments of God are not always the same at all times. When Jesus was on earth he declared, in a miniature way, God’s vengeance against the Jewish nation because of their rejection of him (Matt. 11:20-24; 23.33-38; Luke 19:41-44; 21:20-24), but it was not then proper to declare the day of God’s vengeance against the Devil’s entire world, because it was not God’s due time. Now the time has come to declare the “day of vengeance of our God”. (Isa. 61:1,2) Now the world must be told that Jehovah is God, and that he will vindicate his holy name and make for himself a name in the earth. AU those, therefore, who are consecrated to God are bond-servants, and they are the ones to whom the commandments of God now apply. To such ones as are in Christ Jehovah God says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">chosen: . . . there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” —Isa. 43 : 10, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the enemy has turned the minds of the people away from the Lord God Jehovah, and many who claim to be God’s children mock his holy name. There are many people on earth whom God would now have to hear the truth, for their benefit and to magnify his name. Therefore he commands his witnesses thus: ‘‘Go through, go through the gates, prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” (Isa. 62:10) The religious doctrines which have furnished stumbling-stones for the people must be removed from their minds. The people must be pointed to the highway that leads to life. God’s standard must be lifted up before them, and the Lord God commands his bond-servant class to do this work. This is the good news of His kingdom that must be declared to all nations as a witness.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A faithful bond-servant will avail himself of every means that his Master has provided for giving the witness. Some who profess to be fully consecrated to Jehovah God say: “I will not put out books; that’s selling. I have been a Christian a long time. I will preach from the platform occasionally, and tell the people of my experiences in the truth. My desire is to get rid of all these troublesome things and go to heaven and see the Lord. I will not humiliate myself by going from door to door and asking the people to take books and offer a contribution of money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Watchtower Society has no desire to compel anyone to put out Bible literature and does not believe compulsion to be the Lord’s will. But the Watchtower Society does say, to employ the apostle's language: ‘Brethren, your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">reasonable service</span><span class="font3"> as the bond-servant of the Lord is to apply all your faculties in his service according to His will.’ (See Romans 12:1.) With each one the controlling question concerning books and literature on the Bible should be, Is it God’s will that this means be used to give the witness to the truth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font3"> In arriving at a proper answer to that question let us look at the facts and conditions as they now exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord Jesus is the great Master, and is now present at the temple of God conducting His work. We must give the Master credit for doing his work in his own good way. His way is God’s way. Why has God made it possible, even till now amid this global war, for his consecrated people to have printing and manufacturing plants for the publication of the divine purpose in book form, unless he wishes them to be used for that purpose? Why, since the Lord's coming to the temple in 1918, has the Lord permitted books containing the message of truth to be placed in the hands of the people to the number of over 400,000,000 copies, an unequaled distribution? The only answer is, That the people might know the truth. This is a reading age, of public education. One might remark: “The Lord Jesus did not place books with the people.” That is true; it was not then God’s due time to have books printed and published. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus employed every faculty and means then at man’s command to give a witness to God’s name and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since 1924 down to 1937 the radio was extensively used by Jehovah’s witnesses, and Station WBBR of New York is still used exclusively as God’s instrument for dissemination of His truth. Why did the Lord permit the radio to come into action at this stage of his “strange work”, and why did he permit his people to control and use a number of radio broadcasting equipments for proclaiming the Kingdom message? The only answer is, That by this means the witness might be given to his name and Theocratic Government. The radio has furnished the means of reaching some where otherwise they could not be reached, and WBBR is still reaching such; and once hearing the message of truth, they are ready to read and learn more about it. Thus the door is opened for the Lord’s servants to go among the prisoners of religion and tell them more and induce them to read, that they may know that Jehovah is God and his Kingdom is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To those of religious mind it may be more humiliating to go from door to door and talk to the people or to stand on a street corner with magazines than to stand upon a platform and address a larger audience. It may entail some suffering mentally and physically, thus to do; but what is the Lord’s will? If it is His will that the testimony must be given in this way, then the bond-servant has no alternative. It is his privilege to do the will of his God and his Master joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Suppose one is anxious to get rid of the toils of this life and to have the battle of Armageddon over with and then to be exalted to heaven, and hence he wishes to hear nothing about the service of the Lord. Does not that show a disposition to self-exaltation? Does it not, to a degree at least, show selfishness? The proper attitude of the servant is, What is my Father's will? This was the instruction that Jesus, the Son and Servant of God, was impressing upon his disciples, when he said “Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12) A full and complete submission to God’s will is here stated as a condition that precedes being exalted. Then, in order to emphasize the point further, Jesus said: “For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”—Mark 10:43-45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord does not compel anyone to place books in the hands of the people. He does, however, require such bondservant to meet his covenant or agreement with God That covenant requires the servant to be now a witness to the Lord God and for Him. If the Lord has chosen to send his message out in the form of printed books and magazines, then the obligation rests upon the bond-servant to do his part in putting this message into the hands of the people. If one finds that he does not wish to engage in this manner of giving the testimony it would be much better for him not to oppose or discourage others who are engaged in the work. If this method of witnessing is pleasing to the Lord, then he who discourages others or opposes this method of witnessing is against the Lord. On this conclusion Jesus said: “He that is not with me is against me.”—Luke 11:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is certainly God’s will that his servants on earth should now look to the perfect pattern, Christ Jesus, and copy him. He voluntarily humbled himself and became God’s bond-servant. For three and one-half years he endured the contradiction of sinners, and patiently and persistently went about to give the witness concerning his Father’s kingdom. As a bond-servant he implicitly carried out his Father’s will. Those who have the spirit of the Head, Christ Jesus, will do the same thing. The Lord Jesus was and is the righteous Servant of Jehovah God. (Isa. 53:11) All who are in Christ Jesus as his body-members, and all others who are of his “other sheep”, must, to be pleasing to the Father, be likewise his righteous servants and must follow the same course that his Righteous Servant took.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chief duty and obligation laid upon all true Christians now on earth is to be faithful and true witnesses of Jehovah. One of the titles given to the Lord Jesus for his service was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Faithful and True Witness”.</span><span class="font3"> (Rev. 3:14) No greater honor can ever be conferred upon any man than to be called a faithful and true witness of the Lord. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower Society urges all consecrated persons and all of good-will toward God and his Kingdom to take part in giving the witness, because it is expressly God’s will concerning his people now. As a bond-servant let each consecrated one faithfully perform the obligation of his covenant. Every one who loves the Lord will be eager to declare freely the message of truth of His kingdom. Only selfishness will cause anyone to fear. When one is deterred by fear and reproach, then he is not perfect in love, because one who loves the Lord perfectly is unselfishly devoted to the Lord and has no fear. (1 John 4:17,18) If, in giving the witness to Jehovah and his Theocratic Government, we are reproached, then it is our privilege to maintain our integrity thereunder and to defeat the persecution and to serve for a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The service must go on!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>NOAH, A PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">®® AS THE days of No'e were, so shall also the coming ZA of the Son of man be.” (Matt. 24:37) In these words Christ Jesus gives reason for the careful study of Noah and the events of his day. What conditions prevailed then that are to be duplicated at Christ’s second coming? All who are interested in gaining life in the New World will now consider “the days of No'e”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Noah was the great-grandson of Enoch, and was born 69 years after the translation of that faithful prophet. At the time of his birth his father Lamech “called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us”. (Gen. 5: 28, 29) The selection of this name was directed by Jehovah and is of prophetic significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recall the setting in that ungodly old world. The issue as to whom man would serve had been raised and Jehovah’s supremacy challenged. Two men, Abel and Enoch, their lives separated by centuries, had proved Satan a liar. Now a third man, Noah, born 1,056 v’ears after the creation of Adam, walked with God in vindication of His name. Noah was zealous in God’s service as a “preacher of righteousness”. (2 Pet. 2:5) Three times Jehovah had raised up faithful men to mar the Devil’s domination. A crisis approached calling for drastic action. The witness Noah, a disturber of that religious world's stability, must be wiped out, according to Satan’s wicked purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What was Satan’s scheme at this time to preserve his earthly realm? Direct rule by materialized demons and race contamination. “The Nephihm were in the earth in those days” (Gen. 6:4, A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font3"> F.) Materializing as giants these Nephilim, or “fellers”, caused the religious ones of that world to fall. They bullied the people in dictatorial manner and Idled the earth with violence. (Gen. 6:11) But this iron rule by demons was not enough Satan induced the “sons of God” to materialize and cohabit with the fair daughters of men. Doubtless the adversary approached them subtly as he did Eve and appealed to their vanity by inducing them to believe they could lift mankind from sin and death. They were to bring forth a “master race”! Actually, they were ensnared and the peoples debauched. Some “Christians” today think that by associating with the world they can uplift it by their supposed righteous and pious influence. They fall into the same Devil-snare used to trap the spirit “sons of God”.—Matt. 6: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Note the result in Noah’s day: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. . . . when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” (Gen. 6:2, 4, 5) Co-operating with the Devil to establish a rejuvenated world order the peoples’ minds were given over wholly to vain imaginations of dominion in rebellion and defiance of the Almighty Jehovah. The purposes and desires of their hearts were evil. (Gen. 6: 5, mar.) Selfish pleasures, the lusts of the eye and of the flesh, ruled. Jesus described them: “They did eat, they drank, they married waves, they were given in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.” (Luke 17 : 27) Race degeneration, not purification, resulted from capitulation to the Deval’s proposed order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s witness Noah could not be coerced nor bullied into forsaking God’s service and supporting schemes for a new order in partnership with demons and based on religion. “Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord . . . Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.” (Gen. 6:8,9) He was not neighborly with the wicked, but walked with God by preaching righteousness. Because of his perfect integrity toward God he was informed of the Almighty’s purpose to destroy that world “And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; . . . And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh.”—Gen. 6: 13,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why was Noah told this in advance, within the last century before the flood, and why was the execution of the judgment then determined fixed at a future time? That he might sound the warning, and that the flood might be recognized as a demonstration of God’s supreme power and vindication of His name. (Ex. 9:16) How and to whom did Noah witness for the many years while the ark was being prepared by Noah and his sons? By declaring with his mouth the approach of the flood; by walking in harmony with God, and not with the pleasure-mad world; and by the building of the ark. The latter act was mute testimony of Noah’s faith. It had never rained upon the earth at that time; there had never been any floods. (Gen. 2: 5, 6) Noah would be the object of much ridicule by scoffers. But he believed God, preached, built the ark, and was saved. His faith condemned that nonbelieving world.—Heb. 11: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The flood was no local washout, it covered the entire earth. (Gen. 7: 11, 19-23) By it Jehovah turned the tables on Satan, cleansing the earth of evildoers and preserving the very ones the Devil sought to destroy. As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the last days of “this present evil world”. Do conditions today parallel those of Noah’s day, thus marking the present as the last days and the time of Christ's second coming? The physical facts answer Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today men seek to build a new world; for its foundations they call for “more religion”; through it they think to elevate themselves and make the world a fit place for Christ Jesus to come to again. But Christ’s second coming is not to a purified earth, but to a corrupt one, as existed in Noah’s day. Such conditions now prevail. It is the jazz age of lustful pleasures The times are perilous; the earth is filled with violence. The people are lovers of pleasure, not lovers of God. They despise Jehovah's witnesses, “those that do good.” Their new-world building will have a form of godliness, an outward smear of deceptive religion, a plastering of names of blasphemy, but it will deny God’s power to have universal domination. (2 Tim. 3:1-5; Rev. 17:3) Demon power is now unleashed in a final all-out desperation assault to retain the world rule slipping from their grasp.—Rev. 12:12; 16:14, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another strong evidence that the flood drama is now being fulfilled is the gospel-preaching being performed by Jehovah's witnesses, paralleling Noah's warning, and which was foretold as a sign of Christ’s coming and the end of the world. (Matt. 24:3,14) Noah in his preaching pictured those of the remnant who now give warning of Armageddon, something never seen on this earth By faith they know it will come. As Noah was joined by his sons and their wives, so now the remnant are joined by companions, and all seek shelter from Armageddon's storm in the antitypical ark, God's organization, now built up by the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus These preachers of righteousness give no heed to the scoffers who ridicule the declaration that God will soon act in vindication of His name. These scoffers have opportunity to learn of Armageddon, but willingly remain ignorant thereof Their prototypes were active in Noah’s day, and their presence now further indicates the last days are here.—2 Pet. 3-1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What followed the flood? and is such prophetic? Coming forth of the ark “Noah builded an altar unto the Lobo, . . . and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a savour of rest.” (Gen. 8:20,21, margin) At the birth of Noah words were spoken concerning the comfort he would bring, and he was accordingly named “Noah”, which means “rest” or “consolation”. The commission of the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus, is to “comfort all that mourn”. (Isa. 61:1,2) His followers do likewise prior to the Armageddon fight. But after the flood Noah, in making burnt offerings that had a savor of rest to Jehovah, pictured Christ after Armageddon. The offering of that battle victory will put to rest the issue of universal domination. Evildoers will be gone. The peoples under the “new earth” will be reconciled and at rest with God by the Greater Noah's sacrifice. All creatures will break forth into the singing of God’s praises. “The Lord shall give thee rest . . . How hath the oppressor ceased! . . . The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.” (Isa. 14:3-5,7) The Greater Noah will lift the curse from the earth.—Gen. 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After this offering God announced to Noah His everlast ing covenant concerning the sanctity of life Jehovah has not forgotten that covenant. The nations have By violence in defiance of it they have defiled the earth. Divine justice will be satisfied and the earth cleansed by the execution of the Lord's fiery judgments at Armageddon ..nd few men will survive, as it was in the days of Noah.—Isa 24: 5, 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Noah lived 350 years after the flood, remained faithful unto death, received God’s approval, and shall have his reward.—Heb. 11: 7, 35 ; Ps. 45: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is profitable for Jehovah’s witnesses today to remember the history of Noah’s day. (2 Pet. 3:1-7) God’s witnesses then, Noah and his household, were an unpopular minority, yet they were right. All others were wrong. That was prophetic. The handful of witnesses now, the remnant of Christ's “body” members and the “other sheep”, arc right Popular religion and her majority millions are wrong. Though it may seem the witnesses face annihilation, still Jehovah will turn the tables as he did in the days of Noah At Armageddon “things not seen as yet” will sweep the wicked into destruction, cleanse the earth, and bring rest and comfort to all creation and eternal vindication to the name of the Most High. So the witnesses today take courage from the drama in which Noah acted, realizing that by it Jehovah gives historic proof and assurance of Satan’s defeat and of victory for the minority “preacher of righteousness” class and the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The date Seripturally arrived at for 1943 for celebrating the memorial to Jehovah’s name and to the faithful death of his King, Christ Jesus, is Monday, April 19. After 6 p. m , Standard Time, of that date each Christian company should assemble, and the anointed ones thereof celebrate the Memorial, their companions as the Lord’s “other sheep” being present as observers. If no competent person is present to deliver a brief discourse immediately before partaking of the emblems, then appropriate paragraphs may be read from the Memorial articles appearing in the March 1 and 15, 1943, issues of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to those assembled. Since the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the wme both picture Christ’s death, in which also his body members partake, it follows that both emblems should be served together at partaking, and not separately The emblems should be unleavened bread and real red wine Jesus and his apostles most certainly used real red wine in symbol of his blood, and the anointed remnant should follow their lead. Report your celebration and its total attendance and partakers of the emblems to the Society, as instructed also in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DO AMERICANS IN TEXAS APPROVE OF THIS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It was but a very short time until the city marshal accosted Cofer and told him we would have to quit that work as it would cause a revolution. He then left, went to a group standing near by and apparently gave them the 0. K. to gather a mob; for, immediately after, the mob formed. A mobster stepped up, demanding: ‘You’ll have to get that damned stuff out of this town. Cofer knows what we do to those that carry that damned stuff; meaning other eases of mob violence in Winnsboro. I, in a very moderate tone, asked Cofer where the law was. One mobster, hitting me a blow on the shoulder, answered: ‘We are the law here, and if you know what is good for you you will leave.’ We got within a block of our car when another mob headed by the captain of the Civilian Defense stopped us and held us until the city marshal arrested us. All this time a Baptist preacher, C. C. Phillips, was using a loudspeaker system to stir the people up against us. We were then taken to the city hall and held until the mob was fully organized. The city attorney, being a woman, told us she would try to get the mob to let her take us to the county seat to jail. From reports, she asked the mob, if we would give up our literature and salute the flag, would they then let us go to the county seat to jail? Thus she in her very course encouraged the mob, showing they would have no interference from the law. The mob then became more violent and started to break in the door of the city hall. The city marshal called to the mob, ‘Don’t break the door down! reach through that broken window and unlock it!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“All this time the city officials tried to induce us to salute the flag. At last one of them stated to Cofer and myself: ‘If you don’t salute the flag you will no doubt be killed by that mob, and go to hell on top of that.’ We remained calm and replied that this we could not do, because of our covenant with Jehovah, the Host High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“After the mob came in and laid hold of us, we were taken to the street. I broke free and made a run for it, but was stopped as the mob now grew to nearly six hundred. When I made the break Cofer received little attention; with the aid of his worldly brothers waiting in the mob for him he made a get-away, except for a few mobsters who finally caught them and knocked Cofer cold with a club. At this Cofer’s brother stood over him with a drawn knife in hand, daring any to lay hold of him. As mobsters always are cowards, they did not venture farther. Cofer was then taken in a truck and given medical care. Meantime I was being beaten by the mob in the street. They demanded that I salute the flag. I did not yield, nor did I show fear to the beating. To this one mobster yelled, ‘Hell, you are not scaring that guy; look at him standing there!’ At this time I was covered with blood, one eye was completely closed. The only reason I could remain calm was, I could feel Jehovah’s sure protection. The beating I was receiving was hardly noticeable, proving to me it was His protection. They continued to beat me until I was unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The next thing I knew, they were bringing me to with cold water. Then they beat me again until I was again senseless. This they continued to do. They also tied a rope about my neck and dragged me in the street for a time. Finally they threw me into a small-town jail and left me. Soon they returned and decided to hang me. They again tied the rope (a <sup>or</sup> %-inch rope) about my neck and dragged me from the jail. After asking again the direction of the Most High, I felt sure that all would work to the honor of His name. Up they pulled me, hanging by the neck; but this did not last long. The rope broke. The mob used a highway sign to hang me to. When the rope broke, I was again thrown into jail and left. Shortly the doctor came. He pronounced that I was in bad condition and would need to be taken to hospital immediately if I would live; that was about 6:30 p. m. About 9:30 p. m. I was taken to hospital in Pittsburg, Texas, by the county attorney. After the doctor pronounced that I was in bad shape, the city marshal was heard to say, ‘He is the most stubborn devil I ever saw.’ The mobbing took place Saturday, December 12, from 3:45 p. m. to 6:30 p. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“After I was examined by the city doctor many people came in to the jail to see me. No lights in the jail, they lit matches to look at me. Many said: ‘Oh my! is not that awful!’ Others asked: ‘Is he dead?’ They felt my pulse and, not being able to locate it, would say: ‘I think his heart has stopped.’ By their statements one would know they were not in sympathy with mobsters. Wilcox, of Picton, heard one man tell of the hanging, how I was drawn up by the mob to the highway sign, lifting my body from the ground to hang by the neck. He stated that when the rope broke he knew it was the Lord that broke it. He did not sleep a bit that night, but vomited several times and remained sick through the night. Thus we know that such things are putrid to many people. I am fuDy able to again resume traveling. I am persuaded more fully than ever that Jehovah is certainly caring for His servants. Nothing shall part the servants from Him. (Rom. 8:35-39) May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font3">remain a humble and faithful servant of the New World under the Greater Jephthah.”—0. L. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTABLISHING A BOOK STUDY (KANSAS)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A lady promised me one hour in which to show her that I could be of any benefit to her; she did not want to hear the phonograph; she just wished me to explain I used thirty minutes reading scriptures that plainly showed the time of trouble and the outcome, without her showing any apparent interest. I gave up all hope of her learning the truth. She had promised me an hour, so she could have the other thirty minutes anyway. What to do for best results? became the question. I got out the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World </span><span class="font3">question booklet. (She did not have the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World.)</span><span class="font3"> I asked the first question in the booklet m my own words. She was then asked to read the scriptures on that question. She refused, but asked me to read them. After hearing the scripture read, she was asked to explain the meaning of it. She explained rather well. I complimented her. We took the next question and scriptures, likewise discussing them between us. When the hour was up, she said: ‘A person can learn something that way, but I didn’t care for the way you explained it at first.’ Result: one book study with more than usual interest.”</span></p>

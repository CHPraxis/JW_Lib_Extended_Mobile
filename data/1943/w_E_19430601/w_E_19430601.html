<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can, come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERCOMING LANGUAGE BARRIERS FOR UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When God broke up unity m a wicked work he confused the common language. (Gen. 11.1-9) Now is the time for unity in a good work by Jehovah’s servants Oneness of speech is a great aid to that end. In America are foreign-speaking brethren speaking many languages stemming from the confusion of tongues at Babel. Such language difference should not be let hamper the unity of organization and effort of His people. Foreign-language brethren should use every opportunity and means to acquire the national language of America, English. Such will greatly increase their scope and effectiveness as witnesses of Jehovah in this populous land. In each company, therefore, where foreign-language Bible studies are held, those attending should also assemble with the brethren at the English </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study and service meeting, to use such as a steppingstone to learn English. It will also aid them to keep in closer touch with God’s visible headquarters and its local company organization m carrying on the field witness work. They may have their native-language </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study some other evening, but should watch that no person of their own tongue ambitiously seize the opportunity to separate them from close co-operation with the mam visible organization to draw away followers after himself like an electiveelder boss. To that end the Society will appoint the proper foreign-language study conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same principle would hold in other countries, such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">South American lands where Spanish is the pnncipal tongue, 01 Brazil, where Portuguese predominates. Persons speaking other languages should attend the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and service meetings conducted in Spanish or Portuguese in Latin-American countlies for their own benefit, so as to learn the language and be bettei equipped to meet the people of good-will of those nations and witness to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.&quot;—Ps. 119:86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■JEHOVAH is the Goel of order. Without confusion I he made the shining bodies which bedeck the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> heavens and placed them in their positions. The stars and planets move in trackless space according to the path ordained for them by the great Creator, and thus order pervades throughout the universe visible to man. Everything, in relation to everything else, shows forth wise organization that the divine will may be fulfilled, at the times appointed by Jehovah God. Observing this fact as true of the inanimate material creation, all who desire to do the Creator’s will appreciate the need and fitness of organization. They see the need of determining their proper place in His approved organization, and that they must move about their work within the organization that the final result may be to the Creator's glory and praise. To such God-fearing ones His command is: “Let all things be done unto edifying. Let all things be done decently and in order.<sup>-</sup>’ (1 Cor. 14: 26,40) On the other hand, the totalitarian dictators and religious hierarchy who plan to set up a so-called “new order based on moral principles” are not proceeding subject to God’s inle and command, and God is not the author or sponsor of their manmade “new order”. It will therefore lead only to world-wide disorder and will perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Through God's Word we are informed that he has a grand organization in the invisible heavens, of cherubim, seraphim, angels, principalities and powers, all of which are governed by Jehovah God through his Son Jesus Christ in an orderly manner. “Jesus Christ: who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.” (1 Pet. 3: 21, 22) Under him certain heavenly creatures are put in positions more responsible than those of others, to look after their part of the organization and to see that the work assigned to them is properly handled. It is through organization and co-operation one with another and in unity of mind and purpose</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 (a) What fact do the visible heavens show forth concerning Jehovah their Creator, and what need therefore do those persons discern who desire to do His will? (b) Why will the proposed “new order” fail and perish ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2. What does God’s Word inform us sm to his organization in the inMsible heavens/ and what effect has Lucifer's rebellion had upon it? </span><span class="font4">that much is accomplished. The rebellion of the mighty spirit creature, Lucifer, and his satanic secession from God’s heavenly organization followed by his devilish attacks upon it, have failed to break up the good order and successful operation of Jehovah’s living organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ Down till the present day that traitor, Satan the Devil, has brought reproach, scorn and contempt upon Jehovah’s name, and the name of Jehovah God is held in disrepute by all religionists in “Christendom'’. To take out of the world a “people for his name” Jehovah God sent the apostle Peter with the Kingdom message to the home of an Italian centurion when God first began to visit the Gentile nations. Thus the privilege of bearing the name of Jehovah was no longer confined to the Christianized Jews, but was extended to include henceforth the Gentiles or non-Jewish peoples. (Acts 15:14) As a God of order and organization Jehovah through his Word directs that a well-ordered arrangement be established among the “people for his name”, to compare in efficient organization and orderliness with his Theocratic arrangement in the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ In his typical Theocratic organization which was established among the Jews long before Christ, Jehovah used his prophet Moses to deliver his Theocratic law. It was Theocratic because Moses received it from the Most High God. The law was read to the Israelites, and they made a covenant with God to keep it. The same code of laws applied to all Israelites, regardless of where they dwelt. It made no difference to which of the twelve tribes any Israelite belonged, the Theocratic law applied to him and could not be changed by him through special dispensations by the priests or otherwise. God’s law is not subject to change by men. “For I, Jehovah, change not.” (Mal. 3:6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> “My son, fear thou Jehovah and the king; and company not with them that are given to change.” (Prov. 24: 21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> God’s typical Theocratic people was divided into twelve tribes, with the tribe of Levi</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3. How did Jehovah begin to take out of the nations a people for bls name, and, aa a God of order, what did he direct to be done among them ’ 4 How did the Theocratic law apply to members of the nation of Israel, and what organisation existed among its twelve tribes?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">acting as priests and Levites in the direct service of Jehovah at his tabernacle or temple. Each tribe had its elders and its own internal organization subject to the general Theocratic law. Such tribal organization was bound to see to it that the will of the great invisible Theocratic Ruler was done in all matters by his covenant people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Simon Peter, who became an apostle of Jesus Christ, was born under the Theocratic law of God’s covenant with Israel by Moses. Moses was a typical figure, prophetic of a still greater prophet to come, and concerning such prophet greater than Moses Peter said: “[God] shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3:20-23) Under pain of destruction, therefore, all members of spiritual Isra -1, the ‘people for Jehovah’s name’, are bound to keep his Theocratic law delivered by Christ, the Greater Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ At the time that Peter wrote his first letter or epistle to the Christians he was at Babylon, the ancient city on the banks of the Euphrates river in Mesopotamia. Ever since King Nebuchadnezzar overthrew Jerusalem six centuries before Christ and deported the Jews to Babylon, circumcised Jews had continued to live in that city down till Peter’s day. Peter went to such Jews of the circumcision to preach the gospel to them. This was according to an orderly division of territory between the apostles James, John, Paul, and Peter (or Cephas). Says Paul: “When they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; (for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they [including Peter] unto the circumcision.” (Gal. 2:7-9) Hence Paul went west and finally reached Rome. Peter worked in the Near East, including the Jewish settlements in Babylon, which was then in the kingdom of Parthia outside of the Roman Empire. Close to Peter’s territory were the Roman provinces in Asia Minor, namely, Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Unto the Christians who were “strangers” to this world and scattered throughout those provinces Peter expressly directed his first epistle or letter, because of the persecutions then raging against Jehovah’s “people for his name”. (1 Pet. 1:1,2) So Peter concluded his epistle writing: “The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, salut-eth you: and so doth my son Mark.”—1 Pet. 5:13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Douay Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' In the fifth chapter of his first epistle Peter sets out the orderly arrangement for Jehovah God’s church during persecution at the instance of Satan the Devil and his religious agents on earth. According to the principle or guiding rule stated at 1 Corinthians 10:11 and Romans 15:4, what Peter wrote was specifically meant for God’s name-people, Jehovah’s witnesses, now at the end of the world, when, as Jesus forewarned them, “ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24:3-9) Most bitter and active in stirring up such hatred of Jehovah’s witnesses stands the religious Hierarchy system with its headquarters at Vatican City in Fascist Italy. That religious Hierarchy claims to be founded upon Peter as its first pope. The reader will therefore find great interest in detecting whether the Hierarchy, which claims to be infallible and not to change, lives up to the instructions and example of Peter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUE ELDERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The elders of the Christian congregations whom Peter specially addressed are not elective elders or appointive elders, due to a congregational election or the appointment by any pope or religious dignitary. They are not religionists, but are Christians, and are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elders</span><span class="font4"> by mrtue of Christian growth, being mature, well ver: ?d in Jehovah’s Theocratic law, and fulfilling his commandments by the course of action they take. Such elders in the congregations are the ones who properly set the example for the associate members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ It is to such ones today that Peter gives exhortation, as follows: “The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elders</span><span class="font4"> which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.” (1 Pet. 5:1) Peter was one of the “very chiefest apostles”, and hence was one of the chief elders in those apostolic times. (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11) When Peter was restored to God’s favor after having denied the Son of God three times, Christ Jesus three times reminded Peter of his obligation to be a spiritual shepherd in conjunction with the other apostles. Said the resurrected Jesus to Peter: “Feed my lambs. Feed my sheep.” This was in harmony with Jesus’ command to all the apostles several years earlier: “Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” Each apostle, as an elder, must be a spiritual shepherd and feed the Lord’s sheep.—John 21:15-17; Matt. 10:1-6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Hence Peter had gone forth from one Christian congregation to another in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, and elsewhere (there is no Bible record that he reached Rome), in all places admonishing the elders and the congregations, to the end that they should keep faithful and hold fast their Christian integrity toward Jehovah God. Peter had witnessed the sufferings of Christ Jesus, for he had walked with Jesus since shortly after his baptism and down to his cruel death at the hands of religionists. Peter had also witnessed and was a “partaker of the glory that shall be revealed”, particularly in the holy mountain where Jesus was transfigured with glory before James, John, and Peter. This was a prophetic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">vision</span><span class="font4"> of the glory that should come to Christ Jesus in the Kingdom.—Matt. 17:1-9; 2 Pet. 1:16-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Not only had Peter witnessed Jesus’ sufferings, but he suffered persecution himself, because he took the proper course of preaching the Kingdom gospel. To the religious court at Jerusalem he said when arrested and put on trial: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. . . . We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 4:19,20; 5:29) Because Peter had the witness of God’s spirit and was bearing part of the sufferings that were left behind for members of Christ’s church-body, the apostle was assured that he would be a partaker of the actual glory that should be revealed in Christ. (1 Pet. 1:7; 4:13,14) Because he had taken the course of serving Jehovah God and his kingdom and was faithfully continuing therein and sharing in Christ’s suffering, Peter would finally share in his death. At Christ’s return and coming to the temple Peter would share in his resurrection and would have revealed to him the celestial glory of Christ Jesus and would share in it. Peter did not try to manufacture some glory in advance for himself by claiming to be Christ’s vicegerent and a pope, and then ruling as king of Vatican City and signing political-religious concordats with the totalitarian dictators of Fascism, Nazism and Japanism. Peter demanded of no one to kiss his big toe, but he humbled himself under God’s hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">•TEED THE FLOCK**</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,” had clearly in mind the importance of keeping his Christian integrity. (2 Pet. 1:1-12) He knew that, in doing so himself, he must feed the Lord's “sheep” and look well to their eternal interests. Not only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font4"> must do so, but also all those who are set in places of responsibility in the Theocratic organization. From among such as are elders by reason of Christian knowledge, growth and experience the ones who are made servants in God’s organization are taken. God sets them in the church-body as it pleases him. (1 Cor. 12:18) To such elders, regardless of whether holding a special position of service in a congregation or not, Peter writes an admonition which applies especially now in this time of persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses: “Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.”—1 Pet. 5: 2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> In Peter’s time the elders addressed were all members of the “body of Christ” and hence were anointed with the spirit of God and in the covenant with Him for the kingdom of heaven. It was their hope to share both in the sufferings and in the Kingdom glory with Christ Jesus, and thereby have a part in vindicating Jehovah’s much-maligned name. In A.D. 1914 the period ended of Christ’s sitting waiting at Jehovah’s right hand and he was installed in the throne as acting King. The facts to date disclose that in 1918 he came to the “spiritual house” or temple in his Kingdom glory. (1 Pet. 2:5; Mal. 3:1) Through the light that he sheds upon the written Word of God, and through the fulfillments of sacred prophecy, he reveals his glory to his faithful footstep followers who practice Christianity and not religion. The people whom Jehovah takes out from among the nations to be a “people for his name” are his heritage, and Satan’s organization seeks to break them in pieces. (Ps. 94:5) Of this heritage there remains on earth just a remnant. These must in due time finish their earthly course in death in order to be joint heirs with Christ Jesus in glory. All of them must be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Attendance reports of the annual Memorial celebration in recent years show there are not many of such </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elders,</span><span class="font4"> those who will make up the glorified “body of Christ”, yet on earth. (Rev. 4:4,10) These few must look well to the Kingdom interests and take the lead in proclaiming the Kingdom, copying </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">12. As an elder, what important consideration did Peter have clearly in mind, and what exhortation did he therefore give to the true elders’ 13 What was and is the relationship to God of those elders addressed by Peter, and what are their privilege* as to the sufferings and glory of Christ Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14. What must these elders, as such, do with regard to the others following the Good Shepherd, and, today, who constitute the majority of those following him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, who, as shepherd, always went before his sheep that they might follow him. (John 10:3,4) Besides the “little flock” of sheep who are members of “his body”, the Good Shepherd has “other sheep”, consecrated persons of good-will who are to live on earth forever under the heavenly kingdom. Since the reports show that, for example, in the United States only about fifteen percent of all those attending the Memorial celebration, or Lord’s supper, are anointed ones of Christ’s body, therefore the greater number today following the Good Shepherd are of his “other sheep” class, who expect to abide on earth eternally and to take part in the divine mandate to “fill the earth”.—John 10:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Many of the “other sheep” class, who are companions of the anointed remnant, have been many years in the way since Christ’s coming to the temple in 1918. They have become mature, well trained in the teaching of the Lord God. They have maintained their integrity till now<sup>T</sup>, all the while suffering the persecution that the Devil brings against them. They have proved themselves to be trustworthy brethren. Because of these facts and their many years of faithful service they are properly classed as mature or ripened ones. In many places where there are few or no members of the anointed remnant they have been appointed to serve because of their maturity or eldership, and they have accepted such responsibilities as elder brethren. This is perfectly proper according to the Scriptures. The Lord’s “other sheep”, who serve Jehovah day and night at his temple, were foreshadowed by the Nethinim of old who were dedicated from among the Gentile nations to assist the Levites at Jehovah’s temple. Such Nethinim had elders and a chief among their number, such as Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia. (Ezra 8:17,20) The “other sheep” were also foreshadowed by Jonadab the son of Rechab and the other Rechabites. Jonadab was an elder to those Rechabites as a father is to a son, and he taught the Rechabites to avoid self-indulgence and demonism or religion. (Jer. 35:1-19) This foreshadowed that there would be elder brethren among the Jonadab class today who would be given special responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’• Particularly since 1938, when the Theocratic rule -was restored to Jehovah’s covenant people, the same organization exists among Jehovah’s witnesses as existed at the time of the apostles. Certain ones are put in various official capacities to look after the interests of the Kingdom in the various companies of God’s devoted people. In apostolic times there were elders, or mature brethren, anointed of God, who were appointed to various positions to care for these Kingdom interests. Today, with only a spiritual remnant still left on earth who must in due time pass on to fill up the full quota of the “body of Christ”, there need to be associated with God’s visible organization devoted companions who are glad to take on the various responsibilities, and these must come from among the “other sheep”. Because such ones are mature and trained in Christ’s teachings and in organization instructions and practice, they have gladly accepted the invitation to the various responsibilities, such as those of company servant, assistant company servant, back-call servant, territory servant, advertising servant, etc. Therefore the admonition set forth at 1 Peter 5:1-3 applies now not only to the “elders” who are the remnant of the body of Christ, but also to their earthly companions. These latter, as elders, must also fill the above service appointments and diligently attend to this stewardship committed into their consecrated hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>lT</sup> Due to this fact, then, all those who hold sucli responsible positions in a local company organization must “feed the flock”. Sheep are gregarious creatures and follow the shepherd, who lovingly sees to it that they are led to fountains of waters and to green pastures and places to lie down beside still waters and in freedom from fear of rapacious creatures. (Psalm 23) The food that the Lord’s “sheep” feed upon and that their feeders must serve to them is the spiritual food provided by the great Life-giver, Jehovah. He gives it through his Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus. Jehovah himself is the great “Shepherd and Bishop of your souls”. He sees to it that it is the right food, in due season, and that it is served through his approved visible organization. The spiritual food served up during the past sixty years and published in many languages in hundreds of millions of pieces of literature proves that the Society of Jehovah’s consecrated people, as represented by the Watch Tower Bible and 'Tract Society, is God’s approved visible organization. While there are many so-called “Bible societies”, yet the Watch Tower Society is the only one that has faithfully devoted itself, not to publishing religious traditions and errors, but to printing and distributing the true-to-fact and harmonious explanations of the Bible as God’s infallible Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” At the Society’s central headquarters under Christ, and by means of the “elders” or anointed ones, all of the “one flock” of God are fed with “food convenient”. It is brought to them from the written Word of God and under the faithful direction of the</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">17 How is the food for the sheep provided by shepherds, and what proof Is there that the Lord God has been using an approved visible organization to that end?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">18 Eiow are God’s flock now fed through this visible organization, and what course are Christians obliged to take In order to feed his “other sheep&quot;?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, now at the temple. Such food is passed on to Jehovah's organized people world-wide through the Society’s publications, particularly the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Thus supplied, all local servants must feed the flock among them. Doubtless the vast majority of the persons of good-will are yet like “lost sheep”, like sheep scattered about because of the mix-up of the many religions and because of the predatory methods of the politicians and commercial traffickers who are the principal ones in the religious organizations. Hence it is necessary for Christians who desire to feed those who will become the Lord's “other sheep” to sally forth like a shepherd on the hunt for his lost sheep. They must brave the enemies and other dangers and seek out the true sheep from house to house, feed them, and show them the right way. —Jer. 16:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Whether a company of the Lord's sheep be large or small, the same food is necessary and essential for all. Therefore the congregational study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other Bible-study helps is of great importance. The elders, or local servants, in a congregation must bear that fact in mind in considering Peter's admonition: “Shepherd the beloved flock of God which is among you.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> To do so is their principal work. They must see to it that the flock are properly nourished with God’s Word, cared for and protected. “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.” (1 Pet. 4:17) Hence there must be instruction in His Word that they may stand approved under the judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> “Exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God: nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.” (1 Pet. 5: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> To aid servants in so doing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> have been sent forth from time to time through Jehovah’s visible organization, because some must take the lead intelligently. Christ Jesus, the Chief Elder, took the oversight of affairs when he was on earth with his apostles. He directed the entire matter then, and he does so now since coming to the temple for judgment. After he finished his earthly career nineteen hundred years ago and was taken up on high, he sent a comforter or helper to his apostles and other disciples on earth, namely, the holy spirit. To the apostles was given the oversight of the church in their days, and they took it gladly according to God's will and appointment. They did not shirk their responsibility and try to shift it on to someone else. In execution of such oversight they saw to it that the proper organization was built up within the Christian companies in Jerusalem and thereabouts, and throughout all lands which they entered as missionaries.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>91</sup> There was no constraint exercised upon the apostles to take such oversight and tending of God's flock, but they accepted the responsible special service -willingly. The house-to-house work in search for the lost sheep which those apostles all did is not to be forced upon anyone by constraint. It must be undertaken willingly by those desirous of serving God in the right way. Likewise, if anyone today does not want the privilege of serving in the position of company servant or other servant in a congregation he should not be constrained. Evidently he does not have proper understanding of the Lord’s Word and is not in proper condition to “feed the flock of God which is among you”. Hence the privilege of service should be withheld or withdrawn from such unwilling one.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The identical commission or appointment is laid upon all of God’s consecrated people, namely, to publish and proclaim the Kingdom which vindicates Jehovah’s name and destroys the oppressive rule of Satan’s wicked organization. (Isa. 61:1-3; Luke 4:16-21) Thus it follows that the position of fundamental importance in any company organization is that of being a Kingdom publisher. That being so, then a servant or an “elder” in any capacity may not rightly think himself better than his brethren, nor think too highly of himself. He soberly realizes that the Kingdom publisher who goes from house to house and who accepts from God the commission to do this as an ordained minister is the one actually doing the important Christian work in the earth, and not an elder who merely holds down an office. Correctly considered, any elder must, to be consistent, be an exemplary publisher; otherwise he should not have a position of oversight. He should look well to the organized body of Kingdom publishers and should do his part in the directive work that there may be unity and harmony among them. He does this willingly, because he is unreservedly for the publishing work and rejoices in being himself a Kingdom publisher, be he of the anointed remnant or of the Jonadab class. He does it for the sake of no filthy lucre nor for any selfish gain possible to get out of it, but for his love of God and the Kingdom. The contributions he accepts from appreciative people with whom he leaves the Watch Tower publications he uses solely in furtherance of the Kingdom work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> No one should associate himself with God’s organization for personal gain; for, if he tries to</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">21. Why should no constraint be applied to make anyone undertake any special responsible sen-ice<sup>9</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">22. What is the fundamental position of service for all in any congregation, and from what motives does any elder or special servant act in that fundamental position?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">23. Why should no one associate himself with God’s organization for personal gain? </span><span class="font4">do so. he will lose all. One must have love for God and his children, because without love for the brethren one gains nothing that endures. Christ Jesus tells us that we might gain the whole world, but if we do not have love of God and his Kingdom we shall lose all; our souls will be destroyed. (Matt. 16:26) Should God permit, for a test, that some who want a high position finally get positions of directing companies and thus gain the whole local organization and its direction, yet because they do not have love as their motive the Lord by his angel guards will in due time clean them out of all positions in his organization. Their Inst for power or directive authority, or for lording it over God’s heritagepeople, leads them to serve for filthy lucre, which is selfish gain. Consequently one who obeys Peter’s words and example could never be a pope or hierarchical prince of a religious organization. Jehovah’s true servant serves unselfishly, because any appointed service is a great privilege given to Kingdom publishers manifesting greater ability and fitness than others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup>‘ Doing so “of a ready mind” means being willing to respond instantly to larger opportunities of service and willing to put into the performing of Theocratic organization ii structions everything that one has. One so doing is ready in season and out of season to serve his fellow publishers and to care for all Kingdom interests. He keeps on the alert, is on time, and maintains things in order.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> God’s name-people or anointed witnesses are his heritage. The flock, which includes now the “other sheep” besides the remnant of the “little flock”, is the “flock of God”. Hence the warning to servants: “Neither as heing lords over God’s heritage.” All members of the flock, including elders, are accountable to God their Maker. Why, then, should anyone holding a position of servant in a company play the lord over others of the flock or try to make other Christians subject and subservient to him! To do so means to try to usurp God's position as to his flock. Keep clearly in mind that the essential and fundamental service of the Lord’s organization is to be Jehovah’s witness which means being a publisher proclaiming His name and kingdom. That is honor and privilege enough over which to rejoice. So rejoicing, you will not demand extra honors and services from fellow publishers because you may represent the Lord in any additional capacity among them. Then you will not try to take to yourself that which belongs to God. If, however, you try to lord or lady it over God’s heritage you are sure to forfeit all and in due time be cast out of His organization as unworthy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EXAMPLES OF ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The admonition is to be “ensamples to the flock”. The way an elder or one in a position of responsibility can do this is to be a faithful and true witness, just as Christ Jesus was. Out of all magazines today </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> alone has forcefully brought to public notice the basic actions of Christ Jesus when on earth, that he was Jehovah’s “faithful and true witness”, going from house to house, village to village, and city to city, and that therein he set the correct example for the flock. He did what was right. His faithful apostles followed in his steps. After Jesus was so painfully killed at the hands of Satan's religious organization, but was raised to life and glory, the apostles renewed their walk in his steps. They exhorted the Christians to follow them as they followed Christ Jesus. So, then, every one in a company organization having the position of a servant as an elder brother should be a mature example to the flock and be actively a Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” This is a safe conclusion to come to: When you see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">among God’s people a person seeking prominence </span><span class="font4">and authority, but not engaging in the publisher's work afield by calling from door to door with his brethren to preach the gospel as Christ Jesus did. you can be assured that such self-seeker is not in practice a servant of the Lord. Surely such one is not in condition to serve as an elder or mature brother able to set a right example for God’s flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*' It is very evident from Peter’s epistle that good order and organization must be upheld in all lands in the face of persecution. His letter was written in that behalf. Jehovah, being a God of order, would, of course, insist on order throughout his entire organization, from himself as the great Theocrat down, and through Christ Jesus, by whom He directs his earthly as well as his heavenly organization. Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are “The Higher Powers” and d' ct the affairs of God’s covenant people through a visible earthly organization. —Rom. 13:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” For God’s people to proceed properly with the witness work, that others may hear the Kingdom message, there must be unity and regulated cooperation one with another. So the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, through its head office at Brooklyn, New York, has organized branches in all the earth, which branches look after the work in the various lands. Under these there are company organizations, and within the company organizations there are assigned servants. Such servants direct</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">27 . What is the safe conclusion to come to respecting seekers of prominence who do not engage in the fundamental service?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">28 . What must be upheld in all lands in the face of persecution, and why does Jehovah God insist on this*</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">29 . To proceed properly with the witness work ^hat must exist between the workers, and how does the Watch Tower Society put this condition and procedure Into effect throughout the earth? </span><span class="font4">the activities in given territories. In places where there are no companies, that is, no groups of persons coming together to worship God unitedly in spirit and in truth, full-time Kingdom publishers are sent in and these are known as “pioneers<sup>-</sup>’. They are special servants of the Society to comfort all those who mourn in isolated parts. These servants have the Lord's commission to gather together his “other sheep” into groups for study and action. Therefore upon such servants the duty falls to “feed the flock of God which is among you’’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Wherever they may be, these special servants take the oversight, not as hirelings for filthy lucre's sake, but willingly as of a privilege from the Lord. They reap no money or pecuniary reward from their activity. Nonetheless they are “of a ready mind” and are anxious to be of service to those of good-will. They know their commission from God. They know, too, that every one who remains in God’s flock must hold fast his integrity and so give God a means to answer his reproachers and to prove his enemy Satan a liar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Whether the servants of the great Theocrat be isolated or in a congregation, they will at all times set examples one to the other of faithful devotion to The Theocratic Government. The Kingdom publisher holds the key position in the Lord’s organization, because it is the publisher that sings forth the praises of the Most High. All publishers who consistently show zeal and faithfulness and who besides have natural abilities may be granted relatively greater privileges of service. Then more is required of them by the Lord, because of one to whom much has been given so much the more will be required. (Luke 12:48) There is only one Chief Shepherd, and they are accountable to him. It is therefore out of order for any such to seek to be lords over God’s heritage and flock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> In due time God bestows the reward. “And when the chief Shepherd is manifested, you will obtain the unfading crown of glory.” (1 Pet. 5: 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott; </span><span class="font4">Jas. 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:4) This Kingdom prize applies to all members of the body of Christ who finish their witness work on earth and who are resurrected after he comes to the temple. They are then united with him in his glorious Kingdom honor. Because of faithful service and keeping their integrity for Jehovah’s vindication, they then receive the glorious crown of immortality. A remnant of such body members of Christ are yet on earth. They joyfully await the privilege of passing alive through the battle of Armageddon, there to see Jehovah by Christ triumph over all his enemies. Thereafter, at their death in the Lord’s due time in fulfillment of their covenant with him by sacrifice, they will be “changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye”, and receive the unfading crown of glory in the Kingdom.—1 Cor. 15: 50-54; Rev. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Christ Jesus is the Chief Shepherd of the “little flock” of those to be joint heirs with him in the throne in the heavenly rule. He is the King of the new world of righteousness and of all those on earth who will fear God, honor the King, be subject to him and obey organization instructions. The Lord’s “other sheep” now being gathered into his fold will make up the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors, and they are at present seeking Jehovah God because they love righteousness. They come to Christ by hearing the message. They accept him as Savior and King and make a covenant or solemn agreement to serve God, which covenant they symbolize by baptism in water. This is a covenant of obedience to do God’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Because of faithfully carrying out their covenant and preserving their integrity, these “other sheep” will be preserved through Armageddon and remain on earth forever in peace and prosperity. Down to the end of Armageddon they hold fast their integrity under the stress and persecution from the great adversary, who strives to turn all humankind away from God. After beholding the majesty, power and glory of Jehovah manifested at Armageddon, and after having survived that greatest catastrophe of all time, they will keep on demonstrating their integrity under most blessed conditions, being faithful at all times after Armageddon even as they always were before it. Life is what these “other sheep” hope to gain, because life is that which every creature of sober mind desires. Life without end under God’s Righteous Government and under the overlordship of the King Christ Jesus will be their grand blessing. In heaven the members of Christ’s body will share with him in the administration of earthly affairs through the visible organization that He will set up. It is, then, no mere assumption that under the heavenly kingdom there will be an orderly arrangement on earth. The Scriptures definitely point out that there will be “princes in all the earth” who will “rule in judgment”.—Ps. 45:1,16; Isa. 32:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HUMILITY UNDER THEOCRATIC ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Many who, by God’s grace, will make up that “great multitude” of survivors are today young people. Peter’s admonition is now doubly appropriate: “In like manner, let the younger persons be sub-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">33 To whom is Christ Jesus the Chief Shepherd, and what course of action do those who will make up the “great multitude” take’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">34 (a) What will be the destiny of these “other sheep” who keep covenant and integrity’ (b) How will the affairs of earth be administered after the battle of Armageddon?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">35 Why Is Peter's admonition to the “younger persons” doubly appropriate now, and how do they subject themselves to the seniors’ </span><span class="font4">ject to the seniors; and all of you submit to each other, and be clothed with humility; because God is opposed to the haughty, but he bestows favor on the humble.” (1 Pet. 5; 5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> God is no respecter of persons. Anyone with the right heart condition because of loving righteousness and the principles of truth set forth in God’s Word is eligible for blessings under the Kingdom and may associate himself with the Theocratic organization which Jehovah God has set up at the present time. Young folks are so prone to get entangled with the things of this world; so the admonition is timely, that the young persons be subject to their seniors, that is, to those who are more mature in the teaching, instructions and service of the Lord. Let them seek instruction of the senior members of the organization. Such they may best receive through careful study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtou-er</span><span class="font4"> at the regular assemblies therefor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> Now through the Lord's organization a new provision has been made, namely, the recently issued </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry.</span><span class="font4"> It is not for the young folks only, but for older ones too, that all may train themselves to be better witnesses in the proclamation of the Kingdom. The course is now conducted by the Theocratic school arrangement in all companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. All younger persons, not necessarily younger in years, but in knowledge of the truth, do well to “be subject” to the elder ones and submit themselves in the interests of good order and be clothed with humility. Due to worldly education certain ones are able to express themselves better than others. Although they can do this, they should no less be clothed with humility, not disdainful of others, but meek, kind, considerate of weaker brethren and anxious to help them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> According to prophecy, and by virtue of the work Jehovah is having his witnesses do on earth today, a great educational campaign is in progress. Those taking part should want to improve both their minds in the study of God’s Word and their language so as to express themselves understandably. Moreover, the time may come when they may have to educate many of the people who can neither read nor write. The need of such arises from the Hierarchy’s blinding the minds of the common people to keep them in darkness and denying them even elementary education. The humble person, though he be youthful or be old, is in a safe condition to teach others. Jehovah God aids and bestows favor upon the humble to accomplish his service. To succeed, we must never be haughty or high-minded.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” In these days special full-time publishers, as well as other Kingdom publishers, have a wonderful opportunity to go into small towns and villages and there aid honest people and instruct them in Bible study. In many clergy-dominated lands it may be necessary in this behalf to teach lovers of righteousness how to read. In such lands it has been the policy of the religious hierarchy to educate their clergy and their aristocratic and wealthy favorites to read and write and to hold the masses in ignorance. That is priestcraft; it is not the Theocratic order carried out by the Great Shepherd. He instructs the elders to subject themselves to serve the spiritual needs of the younger ones who -want to publish God's kingdom, and not to exalt themselves and restrict knowledge and the means of gaining it to themselves. In turn, the younger persons should be subject to their seniors and learn from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: casting all your care upon him: for he careth for you.” (1 Pet. 5: 6, 7) Jehovah God is lovingly interested in all those in covenant relationship with him. He ■will keep his part of the covenant and will care for every individual as long as such one is obedient under his mighty hand, subject to its leading and guidance. That mighty hand will exalt all the lowly and faithful ones at the seasonable time. Those of the remnant it will elevate to the blessed position in the glorious throne with Christ Jesus. The faithful men of old, from Abel to John the Baptist, who have long slept in death, God’s hand will exalt, raising them from the dead in a “better resurrection” and making them the visible “princes in all the earth”. However, no matter where one is in the Lord's arrangement, such one is in an exalted position, because he has been favored with the knowledge and service of the great Theocrat and is in the way of life. The obedient “other sheep”, who maintain their integrity down to the final battle of Armageddon, God will exalt in triumph over the wicked oppressors by bearing them safely through that battle and giving them the assignment to clean up the earth and bring forth righteous offspring under their invisible overlord, Christ Jesus, their “Everlasting Father”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROARING LION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> As a result of the “war in heaven”, which began in A.D. 1914, Satan and his demon organization have been cast out of heaven and down to the earth. It is therefore a time of woe to the earth and the sea. Especially fitting now are the apostle’s words: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Pet. 5: 8) Being sober means being steady, and hence able to be relied upon; being reg-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">39 For whom does Jehovah God care, and how will his mighty band exalt all the humble ones in due time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">40 . Why is Peter's exhortation to be sober especially Atting now, and what does being sober mean? </span><span class="font4">ular, calm and unexcited, and serious and in earnest concerning all Theocratic matters committed to one’s care. The sober person '.nil not be intoxicated and swayed by the dizzy pleasures and entangling, enticing things of this world. He always keeps his mind stayed upon the truths of Jehovah God and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Each one seeking to keep covenant with God will be vigilant, or alert and attentive, so as to detect and avoid dangers and to pursue the safe way. He will be observing and cautious. He will be of this frame of mind knowing that the Devil, roaring out his threatenings, tries to intimidate and turn the consecrated ones away from God’s service. The adversary has claimed that Jehovah cannot place on earth men who will keep their integrity under stress. This charge has been proved false again and again, and chiefly by Christ Jesus. Although proved false by others, it does not substantiate the claim that the Devil cannot get </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">you.</span><span class="font4"> Only by being vigilant and sober, therefore, may we see danger as it approaches and avoid it. The great danger to the Christian today is to be devoured, swallowed up and taken in by the lion-like adversary, the Devil. He works in a very wily manner. Sometimes to Christians propositions are presented that, on the surface, do not seem to be taking them away from their Kingdom allegiance and their privilege of serving it. Then, before they know it, their liberty’ is taken away and they are working seven days a week at secular occupations, neglecting the Kingdom interests entrusted to them as Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus, because one has not been vigilant and jealous for the Kingdom interests but has unsoberly let selfish desires and pleasures in this life lead him astray, such one may be devoured or swallowed up by Satan’s greedy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Once, when at Corinth, the apostle Paul went to tentmaking for a while, lest he be financially burdensome to others. “And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” (Acts 18:3,4) While Paul spent part of his time at tentmaking, working at such with Aquila and Priscilla, he never neglected to preach and reason on the Kingdom gospel every Jewish sabbath in the synagogue, to persuade the teachable ones to follow Christ. Every consecrated Kingdom publisher today should make the same effort. Never allow your daily occupations to encroach so far upon your time as to keep you but of God's active service entirely. Some time every week should be devoted to Christian activity. It behooves us, then, to be sober and vigilant, lest the Devil, by his organization, subdue us by his propaganda roarings and devour us. No work is so important that it rightly interferes with your due worship of the Almighty God and his Theocratic Government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Those who resist such encroachments and abide steadfast in faith and faithfulness will be given divine strength and courage and be stabilized and strengthened in integrity, despite all the afflictions by the roaring lion. ““Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.” (1 Pet. 5:9) The guarantee is not given that, if you steadfastly resist the onrush of the Devil and his hoggish organization, you will beat off afflictions. You </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font4"> suffer persecution.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> Be assured of this one thing: that nothing will befall you more than befell our Master, Christ Jesus. The reproaches that fell upon him must descend upon all his faithful followers, both those of the anointed remnant and those of the Jonadab class. Further, the reproaches upon you in the land where you live are not unlike those nor greater than those falling upon your brethren in other parts of the earth Whether isolated, scattered or congregated, they are passing through the same afflictions and meetum the same temptations from Satan in his effort to turn them away from God’s kingdom and service. Let this thought comfort and cheer you.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>HOW THE NEW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">HEN a destructive earthquake, a disastrous storm or a mighty tidal wave sweeps a community and destroys houses and people by the thousands, and leaves other thousands homeless, much woe and distress follow; and great effort is required to relieve the suffering. What, then, of the battle of Armageddon? It will mark the complete collapse of Satan’s organization visible and invisible. What an earthquake or terrific storm or tidal wave is to a community, that final trouble will be to the whole world, only much worse; and it will be the last. —Matt. 24: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It may truly be said that the history of the world has been written in human blood; but the worst is not yet. The long and terrible siege of General Titus against Jerusalem in A.D. 70 brought to the Jews indescribable suffering, and the final assault upon the city by the Romans completely destroyed it. Its destruction was in fulfillment of divine prophecy and foreshadowed what will befall the world organization in the great battle of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trouble that came upon Jerusalem was an expression of God’s indignation against covenant-breakers who had repudiated him and followed after “the god of this world”, Satan. The clergy of that day, posing as representatives of God and hypocritically claiming to be the interpreters of his law, were responsible for the terrible calamity that fell upon the city. Now “Christendom’s” religionists have turned the people’s minds away from Jehovah God. Her trouble, therefore, will be more terrible than that which smote Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Jehovah God has promised to make a complete end of the wicked systems in the last trouble that impends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We may call to mind all the disasters that have overtaken the human race during its existence, all the wars, all the earthquakes, cyclones and other calamities; and then know that none of these equals in woe that which will strike the world during the battle of Armageddon. That this conclusion is correct is proved by the words of Jesus that upon the earth there should be tribulation such as was not since the world began; no, and never should be again. But this great time of trouble will result ultimately to</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>WORLD COMES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">the vindication of God’s misrepresented name and word, and hence in great blessing to “men of good-will”. God has so ordained it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After God’s righteous indignation has been completely expressed against Satan’s world organization, the great stormy wind that will have torn the mountains and rent the rocks will cease to blow; the quaking that will have shaken the earth from center to perimeter will quake no more; the heaven-enkindled fires, having effectively spent their fury, will cease to burn, and silence and rest will once more come to the earth. The survivors will rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then will come from heaven the still, small voice, and the message long ago spoken by the prophet of God will gently speak words of hope and joy to all Armageddon survivors whom he will preserve: “0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. Say among the [nations, represented by the great multitude of survivors] that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.”—Psalm 96: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All divine prophecy has its fulfillment in due time, and can be understood only when fulfilled or in course of fulfillment. The foregoing prophecy has now begun to be fulfilled, in that those who are watching the development of Jehovah’s purpose see that m A.D. 1914 Almighty God, by his King Christ Jesus, took his power to himself and began reigning for a new world. Therefore they know that shortly shall the complete fulfillment of the prophecy follow. The positive promise here made by the psalmist is; “The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The world” here means the new world of righteousness for the vindication and glory of the Most High God by Christ Jesus and for the benefit of all men of good-will redeemed by Christ’s sacrifice. The new and righteous world consists of both heaven and earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven</span><span class="font3"> means the invisible part of the world, while </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">earth</span><span class="font3"> refers to the visible part thereof. For centuries the invisible part of “this world” has been Satan and his unholy angels, while the visible part has consisted of organized forms of government on earth, influenced and controlled by the “god of this world”. Looking down to the time when Satan’s world must perish, Jehovah God through his prophet said: “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create.” (Isa. 65:17, IS) This prophecy must have its fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In harmony with these words of the holy prophet the apostle Peter describes prophetically the passing of the Satanic heavens and earth. He says: “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.” (2 Pet. 3:12) Be it noted that these pass away in the “day of God”; that is to say, in the time of Jehovah’s expressed wrath. Then Peter adds: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3: 13) In view of these two divinely provided witnesses, Isaiah and Peter, we may have full assurance that the new world will be established, and that it will be so completely established that it can never be moved, but shall be a “world without end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Satan the enemy, as overlord, aided and abetted by his wicked angels, has constituted the heavens that have influenced and controlled the nations and peoples of earth. With the coming of Christ Jesus into power in 1914 Satan and his demon hosts have been east out of heaven and onto the earth. (Ps. 110:6; Rev. 12:1-12) The new heaven is therefore now an established fact. Christ Jesus is in control thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next great manifestation of the Lord’s power will be the destruction of the &quot;great whore”, Babylon, and of the political and commercial allies of that religious organization, as symbolized in Revelation 17 and 19 as “the beast” and “the false prophet”. With these destroyed, and then Satan bound as described in Revelation 20, the whole earth (visible wicked systems) will pass away Then there will be no more ungodly elements of humanity, symbolically described as &quot;sea”, but the establishment of the new earth will follow. With its establishment the complete new world will be established, because both heaven and earth will then be under the control of Jehovah’s righteous King, the Prince of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle John had a vision of the new world, and wrote: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”—Rev. 21:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new heaven is the government of Messiah, The Theocracy, born and in power. It is the holy city, the New Jerusalem. It is the government of peace, with the Prince of Peace as its head and ruler in charge: Jehovah’s Theocratic Government under Messiah, which takes the place of that which has long been invisibly ruling the world. The new heavens, or invisible part of the new government, is beautiful and glorious, like a bride adorned for her husband. That is the time when a woman tries to appear at her best, and does so appear. The New Jerusalem is restricted to the 144,000 Christians who are ‘espoused to one husband, Christ’, and who take the name of Jehovah's organization. It is specifically the organization of Christ of which he is Head; it is “the Lamb’s wife”.—2 Cor. 11: 2, Rev. 21: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since Satan the enemy and his angels, who compose the old heaven, are invisible, does that signify that the new heaven will also be unseen? Yes; the new heaven will be invisible. The Chief One in that new heaven is Christ Jesus. As to whether or not he would ever again be seen by the peoples of earth we have his own words: “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more.” (John 14.19) Christ Jesus is the express image of Jehovah, and no human eye can see God. (Heb. 1:3; 1 Tim. 6: 16) Satan, a spirit creature, has also been invisible to man and has exercised power and control over man. Even so the Lord Jesus, the King of glory, though unseen to man, will exercise power and control over men on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the time of Eden until the complete destruction of his organization Satan has had visible represents ix es on the earth. Does this suggest that the Prince of Peace, the great Messiah, will have visible representatives on earth? He will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since God has promised to create a new heaven and a new earth, and since Peter says that in this new heaven and earth will dwell righteousness, we may be sure that the new visible organization of the Messiah’s representatix es will be righteous. The visible representatives of the righteous King on earth will be in harmony with his command and obedient thereto. There will be no ambitious and stronger ones on earth then to push themselves forward and get into the visible governing organization and control it and bring about a condition of unrighteousness. All suchlike will have been wiped out by the battle of Armageddon. The promise of Jehovah is: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isa. 32:1) This will preclude all ambitious and stronger ones from exercising political propensities and seizing the government or any part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But all men are descendants of Adam; and since all of these are imperfect, where can there be found any to rule on earth in justice and in righteousness as representatix es of God’s King?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long ago Jehovah God prepared certain men, who under adverse conditions proved their loyalty and faithfulness to God; and then they died. These men received IIis approval. They will be resurrected from the grave. They will be brought forth as perfect men, wholly devoted to the Lord, and will be the visible representatives of the Lord’s righteous kingdom on the earth. They will be officially “the new earth” under the Theocratic heaxens</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a fixed rule of the divine arrangement that God grants everlasting life to no creature until that one is first fully tested and, under the test of integrity, proves his loyalty and faithfulness. God originally gave Adam life and then put him to the test before he would grant Adam everlasting life. Under the test Adam fell. His failure xias because he gave his allegiance to the traitor Satan, the newly risen enemy of Jehovah God. Adam was both a disloyal and an unfaithful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next perfect man on earth was Jesus. Before the heavenly Father granted Jesus the great and high reward of eternal life as a divine spirit He first put Jesus to the most severe tests. All these tests Jesus met successfully, and thereby proved his loyalty and faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At once the absurdity of the doctrine of inherent immortality of human souls appears. Satan is the author of such false doctrine, and his representatives, the religious clergy, have proclaimed this false doctrine among religionists for centuries past. Before the ransom sacrifice was provided by the death of the perfect man Jesus, it was impossible for any man to be granted everlasting life. This is true for the reason that all men are descendants of Adam and have inherited the result of his wrongdoing. (Rom. 5:12) It is the rule of God that “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive”. (1 Cor. 15:22) The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ must first take place before any man could be granted life everlasting. This, however, did not prevent imperfect men from proving their loyalty and faithfulness to God to the extent of their ability. By so doing they could have his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since, however, there is no other name under heaven whereby salvation to life in the new world can come, except through the merit of Christ Jesus, it follows that life could not be granted until the coming of Christ Jesus and the giving of the ransom by him. He “gave himself [his life] a ransom for all, to be testified in due time”. (Acts 4:12; 1 Tim. 2:5,6) It follows that no matter how faithful a man might have proved prior to the giving of the ransom, he could not be granted everlasting life until the ransom is presented as a sin-offering before the mercy seat of Jehovah God. Therefore the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. (2 Tim. 1:10) The redeemed ones must have one opportunity for life. The opportunity for immortality is for those only who seek it according to God’s appointed way, to wit, by being made conformable to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, and these are made a part with Him of the new heavens of the new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As concerning men who will live on earth in the new world, all that they can do toward being saved to everlasting life is to have faith and, under the test of their integrity toward God, to prove their loyalty and faithfulness to Him and His kingdom by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ABRAHAM, THE FRIEND OF GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">F</span><span class="font3">RIENDS of God are the only ones who shall live in Jehovah’s new world. How may one enjoy that blessed relationship with his Creator’ By friendship with religions that maintain friendly contacts with the political and commercial elements of this world’ Will friendly terms with the postwar “new” world of man’s building on religious foundations make one a friend of God? No; such course would accomplish the exact opposite, for “a friend of the world is the enemy of God”. (Jas. 4:4) What course, then, should one follow ? Long ago faithful men left us examples. (Jas. 5:10) Appropriate, therefore, is consideration of the life of one who “was called the Friend of God”, Abraham.—Jas. 2:23; 2 Chron 20:7; Isa. 41:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.” (Gen. 11:2G) Though named first, Abraham (Abram) was not the eldest son, but was born when Terah was 130 years old. A descendant of Shem, he was born in Ur of the Chaldees 352 years after the flood. This city was in the lower part of the Mesopotamian valley, and on the western bank of the Euphrates river. Its inhabitants worshiped idols and celestial bodies, particularly the moon, and hence were demon-controlled. (Deut. 4:19; 17:3) Abraham’s father was an idol-worshiper, and Jewish tradition holds he was an idol-builder. The Chaldeans of Ur deified Nimrod as the promised seed of the woman of Genesis 3:15. But Abraham had faith in Jehovah; hence knowledge. (Rom. 10:17) God acquainted him with the truth on the Seed and His “woman” and His new world, and Abraham believed therein. He is called the ‘father of the faithful’. (Rom. 4:11, 16) Refusing to mingle in Chaldean affairs, he remained unspotted by that religionized world. His faith, proved by works, was rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While still in Ur Jehovah told Abraham to move out, to leave his father’s house, to go to a land God would show him. The promise was given to him, Tn thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.’ (Gen. 12-1-3, Acts 7: 2-4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> Immediately he departed for Canaan, accompanied by his father, his nephew Lot, and his wife Sarah, who was also his half sister. (Gen. 11:31; 20:12) Having flocks and herds to care for as they traveled, the migrators did not take the short route across the desert to Canaan, which lay west of Ur, but they crossed to the eastern bank of the Euphrates and traveled northward along the river, making use of the excellent pasturage Arriving at Haran, near Euphrates’ headwaters, they camped for a time. There Terah died at the age of 205 years, and Abraham, with Lot and Sarah, promptly crossed the Euphrates river and traveled south and west and entered the land of Canaan. He was 75 years old at that time, which proves Terah was 130 years old at Abraham’s birth.—Gen. 11:32; 12:4; Acts 7:4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon Abraham’s entrance into the land of Canaan the Abrahamic covenant became effective. Abraham did not permanently establish a dwelling-place, but sojourned there in tents. (Heb. 11: 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> He did not take part in the government of settled cities, but remained separate from Canaanite affairs. Abraham wanted no part of temporary man-made cities, but looked for a city that had rock foundations, whose “builder and maker is God”. (Heb. 11:10) By faith he saw the day coming when Jehovah’s new world under Christ the Seed would rule, and that “good news” filled his heart with joy. Jehovah “preached . . . the gospel unto Abraham&quot;. (Gal. 3:8) Jesus said, “Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.”—John 8: 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Abraham and his household, still accompanied by Lot, journeyed farther south, and even entered into Egypt due to a grievous famine in Canaan. Thence he ultimately returned to the place where he had first pitched his tent in Canaan, between Bethel and Hai. By this time the substance of the travelers, their herds and flocks, had increased so that the land was not able to bear them together. Following a quarrel between the herdmen of Abraham and the herdmen of Lot Abraham proposed a separation, to avoid unseemly strife. Lot chose to dwell in the well-watered plain of Jordan, and departed. Thereafter Jehovah spoke to Abraham, telling him to gaze to the north, south, east, and west, and that all the land as far as he could see would be given to his seed for ever, and that his seed would be as the dust of the earth. This promise pointed to Jehovah’s purpose to make Christ Jesus the possessor of the earth, and joint-heirs with him are his body members. This Seed, the Christ, was in Abraham’s time as unnumberable as the dust of the earth, in that the number of Kingdom associates of Christ Jesus had not then been revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though peace-loving, Abraham fought when occasion demanded. (Neh. 4: 14) When Lot was taken prisoner by heathen kings Abraham armed his servants, gave pursuit, and rescued his nephew. It was on his return from that battle that a meeting occurred between Abraham and Mel-chizedek, whom Abraham recognized as a “priest of the most high God” by paying tithes to him.—Gen. 14:8-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several times Jehovah had stated to Abraham that his seed would be as the dust of the earth; yet at 85 years of age he was still childless, and Sarah was barren. To raise up seed Sarah gave her Egyptian handmaid Hagar to Abraham to wife, who conceived and bore Ishmael when Abraham was 86. (Gen. 16:16) But this one was not to be the seed. When Abraham was 99 God spoke to him, instituted the covenant of circumcision, and amplified the oft-stated promise that Abraham’s seed would be numberless, by changing his name from “Abram” to “Abraham”, which latter means “father of a multitude”. (Gen. 17 :1-14) And it was at that time that Jehovah foretold the seed would come through the heretofore barren Sarah, now about ninety years old. “As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. . . . She shall be a mother of nations; . . . Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.” (Gen. 17 • 15, 16,19) All this was a part of a great prophetic picture directed by Jehovah. The marital relationship between Abraham and Sarah depicted the relationship between Jehovah and His “woman”, the universal organization Zion or Jerusalem, which gives birth to His children in due time —Isa. 54:1-5, 13, Gal. 4:23, 26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True to his promise, Jehovah visited faithful Sarah in her old age and she bore a son, called Isaac. (Gen. 21:1-6; Heb. 11:11, 12) At five years of age, Isaac was mocked by Ishmael. As a result Ishmael and his mother, Hagar, were sent away. The mocking of Isaac was the beginning of the 400-year period of affliction of Abraham’s seed that God had previously made known to Abraham, and which period</span></p>

The Society has designated the month of June “The New World” Testimony Period; hence throughout all the countries of the world proclamation will </span><span class="font3">of time ended with the exodus of the Israelites, his seed, from Egypt with great substance. (Gen. 15:13, 14; Ex. 12: 35, 36, 38) Isaac was reared by his aged parents in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord”.—Gen. 18:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Isaac had grown to young manhood Jehovah tested Abraham, and made a great prophetic picture. The proceedings are recorded at Genesis 22. In brief, Abraham was instructed to take his only son by the beloved Sarah and offer him up as a burnt offering. Doubtless Abraham was puzzled. Sarah was to be a mother of nations, Isaac was to have seed after him. Yet here he was ordered to sacrifice his beloved son. Though not understanding, Abraham hesitated not, but promptly rose up and journeyed into the land of Moriah with Isaac, as instructed. Isaac submitted to being bound and laid on the altar. Abraham's arm rose with knife in hand to strike the deathblow. Isaac was “as good as dead”. Then, at the crucial moment, the angel of the Lord stayed Abraham’s hand, and it was as though his son was returned from the dead. A ram, caught near by, substituted for Isaac on the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus did Jehovah foreshadow the sacrifice of His only-begotten Son, Christ Jesus, miraculously brought forth as a human, as was Isaac, and His receiving him again from the dead by the resurrection. (John 3:16; Heb. 11:17-19) It is through this Seed of the Greater Abraham and His “woman” that God will “bless all obedient of the families of the earth’. (Acts 3:25, 26; Heb. 5:9) At Armageddon that Seed “shall possess the gate of his enemies”, and thereafter, endless blessings for earth’s inhabitants.—Gen. 22: 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sarah died at the age of 127, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah, purchased by Abraham from Ephron. Three years later, Abraham sent his eldest and most trusted servant to the land of his nativity to seek a wife for Isaac, which servant was under oath to take no wife for Isaac from among the daughters of Canaan. Rebekah, the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother Nahor, was brought back from Mesopotamia and became Isaac's wife. Abraham's direction of this selection of a wife for Isaac well pictures Jehovah’s ‘drawing’ and placing in the “body of Christ” those who comprise the “bride” of His Anointed King</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After Sarah’s death Abraham had six sons by Keturah, and this necessarily- by- a miracle in view of his advanced age. These six sons pictured the remnant of the 144,000 members of Christ’s body, Isaac picturing the Head Christ Jesus. Isaac was Abraham’s sole heir; the six sons received gifts. So the Greater Abraham made His only begotten Son Christ Jesus “heir of all things”, his body members being sons by adoption.—Heb. 1:2; Rom. 8:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Abraham died at the goodly old age of 175 years, and was buried in the same cave of Machpelah, where he had buried Sarah 38 years before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Abraham, Jehovah God began pictures pointing to His capital organization, headed by the Seed Christ Jesus, through which would come vindication and undisputed universal domination. Vindication of Jehovah’s name was the purpose of the Abrahamic covenant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EDINBURGH (SCOT.) CATHOLICS DRINK IN TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“My wife called on a person whose husband is serving in the army and who has a great admiration for Jehovah’s witnesses . . . Both the lady and the husband are Catholics, but took the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> and the leaflet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses—Their Position,</span><span class="font3"> and arranged for a model Bible study. My wife became ill, so it was necessary for me to go in her place. Immediately I arrived she wanted to ask a question. One of her friends had been in and she had told him all about Jehovah’s witnesses, much to his disgust. His last statement was: 'Well, your priest would be very mad at your buying that book and encouraging that crowd.’ Her question to me was: 'Would the priest be cross?’ I told her he would be very cross indeed, thus opening the way for a discussion. She admitted she did not believe in ‘Purgatory’ and could not understand how it was that the priests said the pope was our friend, when he was an enemy alien, living in an enemy country, and even blessed soldiers going to fight against us. A witness was given her, and when I told her of the study with the ‘Exposed’ lecture recordings, she was thrilled. I put to her the blunt question: ‘If you find that the Word of God goes against the word of the pope, which will you accept ?’ Her reply was instant: ‘Oh, the Word of God, of course.’ She was bringing her child up to be an ardent Catholic. Although only three, the child saves all its pennies to buy candles to burn for its daddy. We had a talk about this, and she was quite concerned to think she might be bringing her child up in the way of the Devil. On my next two calls she was out. I began to wonder if she had decided to remain in the ‘church’, but yesterday morning I found her and just gasping for the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font3"> which I had promised to leave with her. She had been called out to her dying mother the last few days; and this just shows how necessary it is to give these people the benefit of the doubt and call again. She eagerly arranged for us to call again next Sunday, so that we can have a real study on the ‘Exposed’ series. I am very hopeful that she will soon make her stand for the truth and join in its proclamation. We have found that many Catholics are drinking in the truth now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PUBLISHER &quot;FIGHTING FOR LIBERTY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“She had obtained most of the literature from various publishers over a period of years and had heard a few short records. I immediately started a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book study. After several studies she remarked: ‘Well, when one studies, it certainly puts one on the spot, if one is not out in the service, doesn’t it?’ I then made arrangements to take her out in the service, but a serious fall on the ice confined her to her home for over a month. Continually stressing service, I mentioned to her to be on the lookout for the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front. </span><span class="font3">Then she attended two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies and was thrilled. The Society mailed out a copy of the new booklet to all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers, and hers came. She read it and immediately ordered fifty. Her husband is not interested, but she gave him the booklet to read, remarking that he had better wake up. When her fifty copies came, she started at once putting them out to every house on her street. Having myself worked the territory several times around her home, I was fully acquainted with many with whom she left booklets, many of whom had repeatedly turned me down. When her neighbors were not home, she left the booklet just the same and was going back to tell them who left it. At one place where they were always abrupt with me, she handed the lady the booklet, saying: ‘You may not be interested yourself, but perhaps your husband and boarder would like to read it. I hope you all do!’ One of her neighbors contributed a penny. She also informed them of the Bible study held in her home, inviting them.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“AFTER STREET WORK FOR OVER TWO YEARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">near our home without seeing many results, here is what happened. A knock at our door. It was a young man, sixteen years old, asking me for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazine. When invited in, he said: ‘I have been trying to find out where some of Jehovah’s witnesses lived ever since getting a copy of your magazine down on Blue Hill Avenue. One day I saw a man going down the street and recognized him as one of those who were down on the Avenue in the magazine work, and I trailed him to find out where he lived. I found out, and the first chance I had to inquire I did so, and that is why I am here.’ He asked about what Jehovah’s witnesses believed. When told about the establishment of God’s kingdom, he asked in the most anxious and tense manner: ‘Do you think it is too late for me to take my stand?’ ... He then told us his parents were Roman Catholic, and his mother was Irish, making her more Catholic than others. He had been convinced that the Roman Catholic organization was wrong after he had happened to read 1 Timothy 4: 3-5 and at the same time reading in the newspaper about the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and how they never compromised with their persecutors, which proved to him that they must be right; otherwise, they would sooner or later give in. The result was that a model Bible study was arranged for him in our home. In order to find the books of the Bible quickly he has memorized them all and also many scriptures. Last Saturday he subscribed for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, and went out m the witness work.”—Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“SINCE BEING IMPRISONED [INDIANA]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have by God’s favor had the privilege of making ovei 3,000 loans of Kingdom literature, and many here are learning of Jehovah and his goodness. How true and clear the Scriptures appear in our minds when the physical facts foretold centuries ago in the Bible come to pass, ‘Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before religious leaders.’ (Matthew 21:31) Men in prison receive the message with greater respect and more kindness than that manifested by all the religious preachers that I called on in the five years that the Lord permitted me to go from house to house with the good news of the Kingdom. As the scripture, ‘The things that the Lord understands are without number,’ comes to my mind, I remember that on the very day (January 29) that I received the new Watchtower edition Bible. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font3">for 1943 from the Society after they had been refused here on two previous occasions, that was the Bible text for that day. Perhaps some of the Lord’s people who are free and can have these precious provisions in abundance can’t really understand their true value to a servant of the Lord that can have only one of each.”</span></p>

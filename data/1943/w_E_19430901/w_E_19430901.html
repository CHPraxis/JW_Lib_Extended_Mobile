<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God and is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all other things, and is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, as the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the Kingdom before all who will hear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE OLD WORLD ended in A. D. 1914, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of the “new earth” of the New World;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan's organization and the complete establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

As this Testimony Period will be observed world-wide, where the Kingdom publishers are not supplied with this new literature they will proceed with their intensified testimony work using the latest book and booklet on a contribution to correspond. Our readers and all persons of good-will are welcomed to a part in this mighty educational movement, fearless of persecution, because it is only through past “defeat of persecution” by obedient and courageous proclamation of the Kingdom message under opposition that this announced Testimony Period can be carried out, by God’s grace. This period therefore represents a triumph for God’s truth and cause, and all wishing to share therein we are ready to put in touch with the proper organized group of Jehovah’s witnesses, upon request. All due preparation for this world-wide testimony should go forward now, as to your supplies, territory and time. Then you will have special results to report at the month’s close, either direct to us or to the company with which you associate in field service.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Jehovah, who liberateth prisoners.&quot;—Ps. 146:7,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">TEHOVAH only is free in the absolute sense. I When he was alone, that is, before he began his</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> work of creation throughout the universe, he carried no weight of responsibility for any creatures. Of his own free will and good pleasure he began his creative work and made things animate and inanimate. Yet he is responsible to none of his creatures. None of such can rightfully make complaint to God for the station he occupies among the Creator’s works. “Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it. Why hast thou made me thus?” (Rom. 9: 20) “Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? Woe unto him that saith unto his father. What begettest thou? or to the woman. What hast thou brought forth? Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.”—Isa. 45:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> All of Jehovah’s faithful sons are free. He created none of his children unto bondage. Their freedom, however, is relative; it does not exist apart from their Father, Jehovah. Their freedom lies in living and acting in harmony with the laws and conditions which He has made to apply to them and which allow them to give the fullest expression to their lives with good to themselves and all about them, and to the glory of their Creator, God. Jehovah God is the Supreme One, the great God of freedom, and the only one such. Freedom originates with Him. It can come from no other one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Any opposer of Jehovah and his will can not be a true advocate of liberty. The great adversary of God can be nothing else but the foe of freedom and must be and is the wicked oppressor. Satan the Devil is the god of slavery. Any effort to be independent of the Lord Jehovah does not bring absolute freedom to the self-willed creature, but means only loss of liberty into the servitude of the Devil. Such enslave-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Who only is free in the absolute sense, and bow is this proved? 2. What creatures are free, what is the source of their freedom, and how is their freedom relatke*</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3 Who is the chief foe of freedom, and what does any effort to be independent of Jehovah God bring, lead to or mean?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ment leads to sorrow and death. True freedom is enjoyed only in the pathway to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The unchanging goal of the great adversary Satan is to bring all of God’s creatures into bondage to himself. For this reason the foremost issue to be settled is universal domination; that is, Shall the universe of creatures live free in Jehovah, the Creator of all things good? or shall it exist slave to the Devil ? The issue must be settled sometime; and it will be, shortly. The universe cannot exist forever part slave and part free, as at present. The universal creation was never meant to be slave to selfishness and unrighteousness. Of the outcome of this longcontinued controversy there can be no doubt, and it was long ago foretold. The cause of freedom will win the eternity of peace. Freedom is the proper element in which Jehovah’s faithful creatures can live. Those who live and serve him forever must do so out of their own willing choice, and joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Satan’s strikeaway from Jehovah and for independence of action uncontrolled by God did not win a new and larger freedom for that rebellious one. His desire to be responsible to no one but himself, and his effort to exist apart from the universal organization of the great Creator and Life-giver and its regulations, was not the course of selfliberation. He was merely overcome by his own passion to have world domination and to be worshiped and served like Jehovah God. The only effect was to make him the victim and slave of his own selfishness, which is sin. Hence it made him the child of death, utter destruction. “Whosoever eommitteth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. He that eommitteth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. . . . There is a sin unto death: . . . All unrighteousness is sin.” (1 John 3:4, 8; 5: 16, 17) Said the Son of God, who came as the deliverer from bondage: “Whoso-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4. (a) What foremost issue has the adversary's goal raised, and why must this issue be settled shortly'<sup>9</sup> (b) What will be the outcome of thia settlement, and in only what proper element will faithful creatures live?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5. As to Satan, what was the effect to him of his breakaway from God for Independence of action, and why is he a deceiter in offering liberty to others ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">ever eommitteth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant [of sin] abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (John 8: 34-36) Being himself in the thraldom of sin, Satan the Devil is the great deceiver when he offers liberty to others. Those who hearken to him he takes captive and brings them into bondage to his will.—2 Tim. 2:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• He who practices sin can never release himself from its penalty. “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6: 23) The way of righteousness and of keeping one’s obligations to Jehovah God may appear to be a narrow way, but the creature who loosely abandons himself to the motions and pleasures of sin finds at last only the narrowness of the pit and grave. Despite the broadness of the way thither, it is not a free way and its end is the loss of all movement and activity. “For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” (Matt. 7:13,14) Satan the Devil has turned the whole world into the broad way, and those who are walking in the narrow way to life everlasting must hold fast to their course and turn neither right nor left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> God made his creatures free moral agents, with the liberty to choose either to live subject to His perfect and righteous will or to forget and deny their relationship to their Maker and to become a law unto themselves. No creature desires to lose his liberty. It is solely his loss of understanding that could cause the creature to forsake the will of the One who created him and gave him life to enjoy. Therefore the wicked enslaver, Satan, must present himself as a liberator in order to induce other creatures to forsake the laws of Jehovah God and to cast in their lot with God’s opposer. It is well stated, at 2 Corinthians 11: 14,15: “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose epd shall be according to their works.” To put across his scheme Satan the Devil and his ministers must misrepresent Jehovah as being the God of oppression, cruelty and darkness. This means to say that Satan and his servants must use religion in order to deceive and to turn men away from the true God and to make men forfeit their God-given freedom. “Use religion”? Yes; for religion is that which misrepresents Jehovah God and leads</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6 From what can the practices of sin never release themselves, and why Is not their broad way a free way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7 . To induce others, why must Satan present himself as a liberator to those created free moral agents? and what means of deception, therefore, must he use?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">creatures to disobey him. Consequently religion is not the truth, but is darkness. It blinds the creature and brings him into the bondage of error and sin, with death as the end thereof. Satan is the author of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ In the garden of Eden, when the righteous world in which the first man and woman lived was new and young, Satan introduced religion. He did so by lying concerning Jehovah God and stirring up false hopes in the woman Eve. He spoiled her correct understanding and enticed her with a seemingly good thing into overstepping the bounds which God had marked. He persuaded her that outside those bounds was liberty. Yes, by leaning to her own understanding and ignoring the word and commandment of God she could defy Him, eat what she chose and create a new, better and larger world for herself and Adam, so the Serpent argued. Eve had the warning of death for disobedience, but by the practice of religion she thought to gain the prize of immortality and expand her knowledge beyond the limits of what she then knew. So she acted on the word of this “angel of light” and contrary to the known word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Adam joined his wife in the practice of religion by accepting and eating the prohibited fruit at her hand. It was not because </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> was deceived, but because he wanted to please himself by taking his stand on her side and sharing the consequences with her and thus keeping her for himself. He did not fear God; for if he had exercised such godly fear, he would have avoided any act or deed that would displease God. Rather than be a server of God by obedience, he chose to be a server of self, and thereby became the servant or slave to selfishness, which is sin. He pleased the creature rather than the Creator, and this he did because he lost understanding and faith in God. “[For] without faith it is impossible to please him.” (Heb. 11: 6) Religion is a lack of understanding one’s relationship to God and a lack of faith in his word. Adam and Eve did not stand fast in the freedom in which God had made them. They came into the bondage of sin and death by abandoning faith and obedience and by taking up religion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Instead of continuing within the boundaries of the garden of Eden, they were now turned loose into the broad, unlimited earth outside, with plenty of room for the play of their own wills. But though thus given the run of the earth, were they free? No; they were no longer the children of God or members of his household. The ‘law of sin and death” was now operating within their members; and from that law they could not get free until at last the execution of God’s sentence of death upon them brought them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8. When and by what persuasive arguments did Satan introduce religion, and with what thought did the victim take up religion’</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">9. How did Adam then show neither fear nor faith toward God. and into what did he and his wife thereby come?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10. How were they then given the “run of the earth&quot;, and why were they nevertheless not free nor lovers of God? </span><span class="font5">back to the dust from which they had been taken. Jehovah was no longer their God. Their god w<sup>T</sup>as the one whom they had chosen to obey. As it is written: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to‘obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Rom. 6:16) They had yielded themselves to Satan the Devil. They did not love God, for the love of God is to keep His commandments. “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”—Matt. 6: 24; 1 John 5: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’’ By his course Adam brought great reproach upon God’s name. Had he determined not to side in with his wife but to stand faithful to God, cost what loss of Eve might, he would have stopped, at the very start thereof, the reproach and misrepresentation against God. He would have proved the Devil a liar and would have vindicated the name of his Creator. By his lack of love, devotion and consideration for God and His name, and by ungratefully and willfully taking his stand with the religionist Satan and his dupe Eve, Adam brought destruction upon himself. The new, better and unconfined world did not materialize. In reality it became a religious world, a corrupt and dead world, a world doomed to destruction. Satan the Devil became its god, who is a god of lying and rebellion, a god of robbing Jehovah’s sons of their liberty, a god of religion and antagonism to Jehovah's rule, law and word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> To this date the human family has not escaped the bitter fruitage of Adam’s religious course of action. It is written: “The whole world lieth in wickedness”; or, more literally translated: “The whole world in the wicked one is lying.” (1 John 5: 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Auth. Ver.</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: ... by one man’s offence death reigned by one; ... by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; ... by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners,. . . sin hath reigned unto death.” (Rom. 5: 12, 17, 18, 19, 21) There is no denying or escaping these facts by any member of the human family today, regardless of his nationality. Those denying are blinded by the mighty one who keeps them under his power and prevents their finding the way of escape and availing themselves of it. “In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.” (2 Cor. 4: 4) Seeing, then,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12 What scriptures emphasize that the human family has not escaped the fruitage of Adam’s course, and 'that questions therefore arise to freedom-Io\ers?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">that bondage to the Devil and to sin and death have come upon the entire humankind, how can we get free, if possible? More important still, having gained freedom, how can we stand fast for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUTH MAKES FREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Jehovah God foreknew that there would be born men and women who would desire to be delivered from such bondage, not that they might please self and thus repeat what Adam did in Eden, but that they might worship and serve the only true and Eving God, their gracious Creator. Jehovah God is the great Liberator, and he mercifully held forth the promise of deliverance that all lovers and seekers of liberty might have hope and might live according to it. Read the Bible, God’s Word, and you will find a continuous record of the promises and acts of deliverance by Jehovah, which shall culminate shortly in a new world of freedom evermore under a Government of liberation. Properly to him the prayer is addressed by those under religious oppression: “Thou art my King, 0 God: command deliverances for Jacob. Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. In God we boast all the dav long, and praise thy name for ever.” —Ps. 44:4-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Complete deliverance comes with the establishment of that Government by God and its action against all oppressors of man and all blasphemers of God’s name, by destroying them at the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. But even before that grand consummation of his deliverances at Armageddon there is a release from subjugation to this present evil world that is possible for men to enjoy. How? By means of the truth, truth which delivers from the fears, fetters and blindness of religion. The fatal event in the garden of Eden makes it clear that truth and religion are opposites. There has been a struggle between truth and religion ever since, and the overwhelming majority of the world have fallen for religion and opposed the truth and truth-tellers. Said the greatest truth-teller on earth, and he was speaking to the most ardent religionists of the world: “If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. ... Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13 Why Is Jehovah the great Liberator, and why did he bold forth the promise of deliverance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">14 When does complete deliverance come, how is there possible any release from subjugation to this world now. and between v\hat two opposite things, therefore, has there been a struggle since Eden? </span><span class="font5">He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you con-vinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.” (John 8:39-47) That truth-teller was Jesus Christ, who said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.”—John 14: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Likewise Jehovah God told the truth to the religionists in the garden of Eden just before their expulsion therefrom, when he pronounced sentence of destruction upon the Serpent of deception in this symbolic language: “And enmity will I put between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, but thou shalt crush his heel.” (Gen. 3:14,15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> That pronouncement of truth was the first declaration of deliverance. It foretold the coming of the Seed, or the One from the womb of God’s organization, -who would bear the new and righteous Government upon his shoulder. He would triumph over all persecution at his heel and would crush the Devil and his persecutor seed to the death. Not for the sake of Adam and Eve did God utter that word of truth, because </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font5"> were beyond redemption, but for the sake of those of their offspring who should hear of God’s word and who would handle the word of God differently from their first parents.

<p><span class="font5">spring as to its meaning. (2 Cor. 4:2) Thus they would religiously do with the things of God’s word, “things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.” (2 Pet. 3:16) The first victim of this was Cain, their first son. He became a religionist. The one who was first to experience release from condemnation and deliverance from religion and from bondage to Satan the Devil w’as their second son, Abel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*• How did Abel get free? What made him free? It was the truth of Jehovah’s word, which truth Abel did not wrest selfishly to justify himself. He accepted it with faith and trust as a guide to his worship and his course of life. He confessed himself a born sinner, unable to redeem himself. Yet he also expressed belief in the truth that by the Seed, who would be bruised at the heel by the Serpent, Jehovah God would provide the sacrifice that would ransom Abel and all other believers from sin and death. As to Abel’s justification by faith from inherited condemnation it is written: “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.” (Heb. 11: 4) Sin lay at Cain’s door, and he hated his righteous brother. Hatred made Cain a murderer of the righteous worshiper of Jehovah God. His works were evil, and he was in bondage to the wicked one Satan. His murder of Jehovah’s first witness on earth did not emancipate him from servitude, whereas by God’s resurrection power Abel will be brought forth to life and liberty in the righteous New World.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark12"></a>STANDING FAST FOR FREEDOM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For freedom did Chiist set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yohe of bondage.&quot;—Gal. 5:1, Am.Rev.Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">WO thousand years after Jehovah's promise in Eden another powerful truth foretelling the coming deliverance of mankind was given, to Abraham, “the friend of God.” It revealed that the Liberator would come through the line of that man of faith. Not far from Abraham’s birthplace religion had been re-established on earth and organized, at Babel, or Babylon, shortly after the flood of Noah’s day. Also dictatorship or totalitarian rule had been set up there, with religion as the means to make such oppressive rule of the people palatable to them as if being according to heaven’s wish and purpose. Bloody aggression and greedy commercialism followed. Abraham came out from under such worldly bondage. He came out and no longer lived as a part of this world of religion, commerce and politics, and thereafter wandered loose and disengaged therefrom, living in tents wherever God led him, and looking forward to the ushering in of a world absolutely rid of such things, including their originator, Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ How did Abraham gain his freedom? By the truth of Jehovah’s word, mixed with faith and with works of faith on Abraham’s part. To what truth Abraham already knew, from and after God’s revelation of purpose at Eden, Jehovah now added the further truth concerning the Seed and said: “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” “Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: ... So shall thy seed be.” (Gen. 12:3; 15:5) So “[Abraham] believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness”; and thereby Abraham pleased the Lord God and was relieved of condemnation.—Gen. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ Abraham’s wife Sarah continued barren up to seventy-five years of age. In anxiety she offered Abraham her Egyptian maidservant Hagar to act for her in bearing a child to him that thus he might have a seed for God's service, if that pleased God. Abraham took this bondwoman Hagar, and she became the mother of a son named Ishmael. But Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman, was not the one chosen of Jehovah God to be the promised “seed of Abraham'’. Fifteen years later, when Abraham was a hundred and Sarah ninety years old, Jehovah's miraculous power worked through this aged pair to give them the son in whom the seed should be called, and which son was named </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Isaac.</span><span class="font5"> Isaac was the son of the freewoman, Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> When he was weaned, Ishmael, the son of the Egyptian bondwoman, mocked and persecuted Isaac, and showed he was a bondservant to the Devil and not possessed of the faith of Abraham. Therefore, according to God's will and command, the bondwoman and her son were cast out or dismissed from Abraham's tents and let go whither they would, serving whom they chose. Abraham's son by the freewoman was to be the sole and undisputed heir of his father. Like his father he must be servant to none on this earth, but should stand fast in the freedom in which he was born. This he must do by exercising faith like his father Abraham's, accepting God's word, believing in its truth and keeping God’s commands.—Gen. 16:1-16; 21:1-21; 25:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ALLEGORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ These historical developments were recorded in God’s Word of truth because they serve as an allegory. That is to say, they were the acts of a great prophetic drama performed by living actors and shadowing forth greater things to come, things of great interest and importance today to those who desire to be free. To those who against their best interests desire to be under religion and its ceremonies and observances the apostle Paul writes: “Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. [The other covenant was that made with Abraham concerning the seed through whom all families of the earth should be blessed.] For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.”—Gal. 4: 21-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>e</sup> The Jerusalem of Paul’s day was occupied by the Jews who were by birth “after the flesh” the descendants from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They were “Jews by nature”. Jacob and his twelve sons went down into Egypt and there became a great people. Then, because they were the chosen people of Jehovah God, the Devil caused the Egyptians to hate, oppress and enslave them. God had not chosen his people to be slaves, to serve men, but to be unencumbered to serve the Most High God. He raised up Moses as their liberator. By the hand of Moses he led them forth out of the house of bondage and out of the furnace of iron, and destroyed their persecutors, the Egyptians. Thereby Jehovah made a name for himself and he made the Israelites or Jews to be his witnesses. He brought them to himself at Mount Sinai. There he inaugurated a covenant with them and gave them the law of the Ten Commandments and related ordinances and statutes. This law covenant was four hundred and thirty years after Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham concerning the seed of the promise. When God formed the nation of Israel under the law covenant, did that mean the promised seed could and would come only by their self-efforts in the flesh according to the law covenant? No! If not, why was it added to the covenant made with Abraham?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ It was to keep the Israelites or Jews independent of all nations and clean and separate from all religion till the promised seed should arrive. Then thex could join that one, just as they had followed Moses. (Gal. 3:19,24-29) Thus they would become Abraham’s seed indeed, not by reason of natural descent as “Jews by nature”, but by virtue of faith in Jehovah and in the Seed whom He brought forth. Having inherited imperfection and sinful propensities and inclinations, they were disposed toward sin and its subtle form which is religion. Hence God warned them against being unequally yoked with religionists, because their nation could not exist free and at the</span></p>

Why was this law covenant added to God’s covenant with Abraham? and what warnings against religion did it include, and why? </span><span class="font5">same time be allied with religion’s slaves. God’s law said: “Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.” (Ex. 23:32,33; 34:12-16) “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.”—Deut. 7:16, 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Time and again the nation of Israel forsook the law of Jehovah to indulge in religion, worshiping things made by creature hands and entering into treaties and alliances with the religionists round about them. God's law is the “law of liberty” from sin, religion and Devil. If the Israelites thought they were not free in being under the law to serve Jehovah God, then when they rebelled against his Theocratic law and rulership and attached themselves to religion, they always found it led them into sore bondage to the Devil and his demons and to his religious dupes and agents on earth. Without exception religion proved to be a snare to catch them into bondage. They came under great oppression. Repeatedly Jehovah God displayed himself as the God of freedom by liberating them from religion and religionists. He raised up to them deliverers, and in this role all of these pictured the coming seed of Abraham, the Seed of God’s “woman” who must bruise and crush the Serpent’s head.—Judg. 2:11-19, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ The last such deliverance from bondage to their enemies was after the seventy years of desolation of the city of Jerusalem and captivity in Babylon. Then freedom of worship in their own homeland was granted them, and King Cyrus permitted all those “whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem”. (Ezra 1:1-5) Thereafter Jerusalem and her people never again fell to the worship of idols and heathen gods. Nevertheless, Jerusalem and her children did not stand fast for freedom. She again came into bondage through the snare of religion. But how! you inquire. By departing from the truth of God’s written Word. She took up with the precepts of men and with human traditions of teachers who put their own and other men’s interpretations and philosophies above and before God’s Word and commandments. This blinded the Jews to the true sense of God’s Word and laws and led to the development of a clergy class among them, including scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, and lawyers. Said Jesus to them: “Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition! . . . Thus have ye pade the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. . . . But in vain they do worship [God], teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Such form of worship came to be known as “the Jews’ religion”, or “Judaism”, and Saul of Tarsus said that “the most straitest sect of our religion&quot; was to live as a Pharisee. He said further: “Ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.”—Acts 26: 5; Gal. 1:13,14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Jerusalem and her children came into bondage, and that because of religion. Hence God’s law given to the Jews by Moses at Mount Sinai did not serve as a schoolmaster to lead the religionists to Christ Jesus. In the grand allegory of Abraham and his free wife and his bondwoman, that “friend of God&quot; served as a prophetic figure of Jehovah God himself. His wife Sarah served as a picture of God’s &quot;woman&quot; that produces the “seed”, namely, God’s holy organization universal. The “seed of Abraham”, then, which is also the seed of God’s “woman”, is Christ Jesus. He is the Son of Jehovah God and is brought forth from the body of God’s universal organization. He has been separated unto God’s special purpose as Vindicator of His name and as King of the New World of freedom, the glorious Emancipator who brings ‘deliverance to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound’.—Gal. 3: 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The heavenly organization of God’s sons is free, because it is united to Jehovah God as the freewoman Sarah was to Abraham. The beloved Son of God, Christ Jesus, is free. He makes those free who accept him and hear the truth at his mouth and follow him. But religious Jerusalem and her children on earth did not become free. Jesus showed why, when he said to her: “0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, an3 ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.” (Matt. 23:37,38) She and her children chose to stay in bondage to her religion at the temple house, and she rejected the Deliverer who would have made her free. It was to her religious children that Jesus said, “Ye are of your father the devil,” and the works of their father they did in killing Christ Jesus and in choosing the heathen Caesar as king. Forty years thereafter Jerusalem was wiped out by the armies of Caesar. The inducing cause and the whole responsibility therefor are to be assigned solely to religion!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Hundreds of years prior to that, when Jerusalem was faithful to Jehovah God and when his anointed king, David, reigned upon her Mount Zion, Jerusalem was a typical picture of God’s organization above. King David was a type prophetic of Jehovah’s anointed Son, Christ Jesus the King. One sabbath day Jesus preached in the synagogue at Nazareth and he read and applied to himself the prophecy of Isaiah: “The spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to publish a release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; to dispense freedom to the oppressed; to proclaim an era of acceptance with the Lord.”—Luke 4: 18, 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott </span><span class="font5">reading.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Jesus exposed religion and declared the truth to the people concerning the kingdom of God to show them the way of release from religion, sin, and Devil. Those Jews who came to him in faith and became his disciples and continued in his word of truth were made free. They became free even from the law of Moses, which required of them perfection of righteousness. Such requirement they could not meet, and therefore the law showed them always their bondage to sin, imperfection and death. In due time Gentiles, or non-Jews, received the truth of Christ Jesus and accepted and believed in him as the Seed of God’s “woman”, the Seed of Abraham in whom all families of the earth should be blessed. These were likewise liberated from sin and its condemnation, and from bondage to the Devil, and from religion, which is demonism. Christ Jesus did not bring such Gentiles, or non-Jewish believers, into subjection to the law of Moses from Mount Sinai, for even the Jewish believers Jesus relieved of obligation to that law covenant of Sinai. To all such believers, whether Jew or Gentile, Christ Jesus opened the way to come to Jehovah God the Father. Jehovah begot them with his spirit, or invisible force of life, and they were adopted and made a part with Christ Jesus of the seed of Abraham. A remnant of such are on earth today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MADE FREE FOR FREEDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> To this day the religionists resent it when one breaks loose from religion and enters into the liberty of a true follower of Christ Jesus. They use craft and make sly efforts to entrap and bring the delivered one back again into bondage. In apostolic days the sticklers for the Jews’ religion sought to do that very thing. They induced some believers to be circumcised in the flesh and to “observe days, and months, and times, and years”, and to try to justify themselves through, works of the flesh according to Moses’ law rather than through faith in the perfect redemptive work of Christ Jesus the Liberator.—Gal. 1:16; 4:9,10; 5:2-6; 6:12,13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> Such reasoning and philosophizing upon the law of God through Moses is not according to Christ Jesus or his inspired apostles. It is not according to the great Spirit, Jehovah God. It is according to religion and its traditions of men, men who reject Jehovah as God, Christ Jesus as King, and Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus as the only means of emancipation for humankind. They desire rather to show what they can do in the flesh and what they can create by their own hands guided by religion. Such men are not children of a free organization, but of Satan’s organization of world oppression. With words fitly spoken, in his epistle to the Galatians, Paul cries out triumphantly to God’s adopted sons, who are part of the seed of Abraham with Christ Jesus the Greater Isaac: “But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman. For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.”—Gal. 4: 26, 28,31; 5:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Isaac of old was a witness of Jehovah. Christ Jesus, the Greater Isaac, by his faithful testimony concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, earned the shining title “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev. 3:14) Jehovah’s witnesses of today, who are the adopted and anointed sons of God, are the remnant of the body of Christ, the Greater Isaac and Seed of Abraham. They are children of the free organization, the heavenly Jerusalem; they are no part of this world which is in bondage to the “god of this world&quot; and his religion and wickedness. Although in the world, they are not of it. (John 15:19; 17:14,16) They advocate and belong to the Theocratic Government of the righteous New World, which world is at hand with freedoms such as men have never known for six thousand years. Not only are these free, but all persons of good-will who forsake religion, accept the truth, consecrate themselves to God, and become the companions of Jehovah’s witnesses, even all these “other sheep” of the Lord are equally free with them. Who has made them free, and for what purpose? “For freedom did Christ set us free!” Therefore to us the apostle’s exhortation is directed: “Stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.” Being at the threshold of the New World, there is every inducement and reason to “stand fast”. None who are bondservants of the things opposed to God will enter into that new world. Only the free will enter through its gleaming portals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YOKE OF BONDAGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> There should be no uncertainty as to what the “yoke of bondage” is. It is religion, which is demon-isin. At this crucial stage of world history Jehovah’s free people stand in a time of decision like that of the man and woman in Eden when confronted with the temptation of the Serpent the Devil. The New World of God’s building is before us. Inasmuch as the announcement of it has gone forth and continues to go to all the nations of the old world, the wily adversary and counterfeiter again tries to appear as an “angel of light”. He assures humankind that he wants to see men happy and all their burdens and fears lifted off them. Who does not know of the Nazi and Fascist political propaganda concerning a “new order founded on justice and morality&quot;? And besides that: Not to be outdone by the dictators, other leading figures in the world come forward, and in all sincerity no doubt. To meet the crisis they come with plans for a postwar global organization in which, by liberal-minded arrangements, there are to be provided a fullness of earth's bounties for all; a strongly guarded peace; security in one's rights, privileges and property; ample room for self-expression and self-development: removal of all grounds for fear; and the fullest toleration of every one in his own manner of worship. All these brilliant ideas of a new. finer and better world are to be realized if man will simply stretch forth his hands and create it according to the religious, political, commercial and social pattern drawn for him by world leaders; and all credit for the attainment of such transformed world is to be given to men, its creators. Man is at last to be justified, vindicated, by the “works of the flesh&quot;, the creation of his own hands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> No one questions the eminence and worldly wisdom of the men and women who endorse and push such programs for the man-made new world order. No one doubts, either, that Jehovah’s witnesses are hated and persecuted by all nations. Nonetheless, Jehovah’s witnesses can not and will not forego their right and obligation before God Almighty to proclaim The Theocratic Government and the world of righteousness which He will establish without any human assistance. They know that the worldly-wise proponents of an improved, re-made world are deceived by the “god of this world”, and are being used of him to turn the attention and desire of the human race away from Jehovah God's promised world to Satan’s disappointing substitute and counterfeit. It is merely a last, desperate effort of the Devil to maintain his domination of the world, and under him it can not and never will be a free world, any more than the world for millenniums past has been such.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup>° “Christendom” of 1943 was foreshadowed by unfaithful Jerusalem and her children. All of them, both mother and children, were in bondage to religion, and therefore rejected the real Deliverer and King in favor of Satan’s domination of the world by his visible agent, Caesar. So, too, “Christendom&quot; has rejected the rightful King of the world and offers a gawdy, gilded makeshift which will never bring what its designers promise. Jehovah's witnesses are not'deceived, because they are enlightened by God's Word and do not lean to the understanding of men. They appreciate it that they have been granted favorable decisions in the Supreme Court of the United States in behalf of their rights and liberties as Christians and ministers of God’s Word. They appreciate it that the High Court of Australia has exonerated Jehovah’s witnesses and ruled that they are not a “subversive” association and hence are not an “illegal organization” subject to being banned. Despite this, Jehovah’s witnesses know that these favorable facts do not guarantee their freedom for the postwar epoch, nor their security against worldwide persecution and encroachment. The Word of God has opened their eyes to see who are the real rulers of this old world and why, therefore, their fight is not with human creatures, or “with flesh and blood”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The apostle Paul exposes who are the behind-the-scenes fighters against real liberty and against whom true Christians must stand. He says to them: “Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil [the prince of the demons]. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:11,12, marginal reading) It is the invisible demon principalities, powers and world rulers who are dominating the earthly situation and all selfish moves made by men of this world. Therefore the proposed human order beyond this total war can not be free; not with wicked spirits higher than men maneuvering all the nations into opposition to Jehovah God and his Son’s righteous Government. Satan the prince of demons and all his wicked angels have been cast out of heaven and are now confined to the earth’s vicinity. They are in great wrath. They well know that shortly they face a final, showdown fight with the victorious organization of God and his King which fought and hurled them out of the heavens. Therefore they are bent on organizing a line-up of all humankind against God. This will hardly allow, no, not at all allow for any real liberty. All men who are not free from Satan's organization and who do not stand fast for freedom from it will be regimented onto the side of the enemy of Jehovah and the New World of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> What if human totalitarian dictators were to be eliminated ? Yet with the real and more powerful dictators still on top and men underneath and without the “full armour of God&quot;, what actual progress and what real gains for liberty will the leaders of mankind make? None. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions know that in the revamped order after the present conflict for world domination they cannot relax their vigilance: more than ever they will have to stand firm for freedom. Mindful of the Scripture prophecies, they look for an association of nations to be formed which will constitute a supernational organization for world security, law and order. That will be higher than any present national government, and the nations in this association will be obliged to yield up some of the national sovereignty. But, let them build it as high as the tower of Babel, God’s Word yet stands true that only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his reigning King are &quot;the Higher Powers’’, to whom all Christian souls must be subject for conscience’ sake. By their covenant with the Most High Sovereign and his King they are obliged to “obey God rather than men ”,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Encroachments against Christian obedience to God’s law and against Christian proclamation of the truth will continue, because religion, which is demonism, will hold the world in its grip with a death clutch. Let freedom-lovers never drop their guard. Keep in mind the prophetic warning of Revelation, chapter 17, that the “great whore’’ of organized religion will prosecute her fornication with the rulers and merchants of the earth who cry, “What the world needs is more religion!’’ She still claims and she will gain a seat on top of the postwar “collective security” creature. As a result the “beast” and its “ten horns”, which receive power and give their strength unto the &quot;beast” for “one hour”, will then “make war with the Lamb”, who is “Lord of lords and King of kings”. That means a final campaign of religious war against Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions who “follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are not unaware of how religion fights. At hand is a letter dated “Port of Fort Erie, Ontario, March 15. 1943”, and from “National Revenue, Canada”. It is addressed to the Watchtower Society, which was decreed by Royal Order in Council in 1940 to be an “illegal organization” in Canada, which Dominion professes to be a Christian nation and to hold the Word of God in high regard. The letter reads: “Gentlemen: I beg to advise that I have forwarded you via Railway Express Agency one package containing 7 Bibles which had been left at our office by various parties, as all Bibles published by your firm are prohibited entry into Canada. Yours truly, [signed] Collector of Customs and Excise.” Only organized religion could be responsible for such direct action against these Bibles, which are the authorized King James Version reproduced unchanged. Giving us further foregleams of what is in store for the truth in the postwar era is the Resolution adopted last May in the closing session of the Catholic Press Association of the United States convention in Toledo, Ohio; and which Resolution reads, in part: “We regret what seems to be a systematic and sustained attack upon the Catholic church on the part of certain periodical magazines in America. . . . The Catholic Press Association expresses its abhorrence of all attacks upon religion and the church, especially at this critical moment when collaboration of all moral and spiritual forces is imperativelv necessarv.” (Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> Mav 22, 1943) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> A relentless effort will be made to bring conditions to where organized religion and her political and commercial consorts can cry “Peace and safety!” Not, of course, with reference to the servants of Jehovah and “men of good-will” toward his Kingdom. Regardless of the adverse oppressive action of men in high places of power now and in the future, Jehovah’s covenant people are guided by the inspired declaration: “For freedom d</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup>d Christ set us frfe.” They will refuse to sacrifice this freedom to worship and praise the Lord God and his New World. To yield would mean to bow in bondage to Satan’s </span><span class="font5">organization and to demonism, which is religion. It would mean becoming bondservants to the sin of rebellion against God and of treason against his universal domination. Christ Jesus, by his ransom sacrifice and by his truth revealed since coming to the temple in A.D. 1918, has made us free, but not that we might choose again the bondage of religion and of sin and thereby relapse back under the power of Satan and his demons and his doomed world. Jehovah God, by his Liberator Christ Jesus, made us free to remain so forever as the devoted people of the Most High.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Not for a selfish purpose will the liberated ones “stand fast for freedom” and fight against being “entangled again with the yoke of bondage”. They must use their favored position to do lasting good to the people according to God's will and commandment. To them it is written: “Now, brethren, you were invited to Freedom; only take care lest this freedom become an occasion for the flesh; but through love be you subservient to each other. For the whole law is fully set forth in this single precept: ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.’”—Gal. 5:13,14, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> reading.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup>’ The brethren will therefore hold fast their liberty in Christ, using it to show love for the Lord’s “other sheep” who have been scattered by organized religion’s shepherds. They will obey God’s commandment to go forth and carry the spiritual food to these starving sheep and show them the way of escape from religion and to the spiritual well-being and prosperity under Jehovah’s Theocratic organization. No time remains now to fight one another, to bite and devour one another in disunity; for that is a way to consume one another as the Devil, the Dragon, would have us do. Voluntarily we must sink-all things of selfish concern and unite in the common cause against the enemy, doing so for the advancement of the Kingdom interests against the aggressions of demon-controlled men.—Gal. 5: 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> It is not the time for us to try to please men of the world with our message. Says the apostle Paul: “Is it mans favour or God’s that I try to gain? Or am I seeking to please menIf I were still a manpleaser, I should not be Christ’s servant. I must tell you, brethren, that the gospel which I preach bears no human impress.” (Gal. 1: 10,11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth')</span><span class="font5"> Not according to this world and its works of the flesh will we walk, but we will walk after and according to the great Spirit Jehovan by keeping his law. We desire to be filled with his spirit; for it is written: “Uphold me with thy free spirit.” (Ps. 51:12) “Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. ” (2 Cor. 3:17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> Not for a moment will we yield room to false brethren, members of the “evil servant” class. They seek to spy out our liberty and then to devise subtle schemes and arguments to lead the unsuspecting and unaware back into bondage to dreams of perfecting character-development, respectability with the world, religious formalisms, man worship, and suchlike.—Gal. 2: 4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">*’ We cannot go back into the world and fall in with its schemes of reforming the world and building it up for a long time to come; “for if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,” said the apostle. (Gal. 2:18) Such would be the course of self-enslavement; whereas Christ Jesus did not deliver us for such a choice. “Be not ye the servants of men,” ye for whom Christ died. To maintain our standing in him we must keep up the fight for freedom; we must continue to obey the truth and to proclaim it to others, that the Lord’s “other sheep” may gain the liberation which it brings. In view of the certainty of further and increasing aggressions of the enemy who envy and begrudge Jehovah’s people their liberty in Christ, the best resistance is to steadily press the offensive against the forces of demonism, which is religion. Christ Jesus, our Leader, is not on the defensive, but is on the march to victory. The armies which are in heaven follow him, and his remnant on earth do likewise, whithersoever he leads.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>90</sup> The remnant, with their companions in arms, must keep up the offensive against demonism in these closing days of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Elisha work</span><span class="font5"> of the church of God in Christ Jesus. Remember the counsel of the prophet Elisha when on his deathbed, at which time the demon-worshiping Syrians were carrying on their aggressions against the nation of Israel. Under the pressure the king of Israel, the grandson of King Jehu, came down to the sick Elisha and wept over him. “And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows.” The king did so. Then Elisha said: “Put thine hand upon the bow.” “And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.” Then Elisha had the king open the window eastward in the direction of Syria, the land of the enemy religionists. “Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And [Elisha] said, The arrow of the Lord's [Jehovah’s] deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. And [Elisha] the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.”—2 Ki. 13:14-19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>51</sup> Unlike the king of Israel, let Jehovah’s representatives on earth of His kingdom not stay the offensive nor slack the hand. Clad in the full armor of God, they will in the remaining action of the Elisha work carry on the offensive against demonism without letup. Let them take the arrowshaft of Theocratic truth and shoot against the land of demonism; it is “the arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance!” So take the arrows of truth, and bundle them together into a strong, unbreakable, invincible union of truth. Then smite the earth, or visible part of demonism, therewith, not once, nor twice, nor thrice, but as with a continuing smiting until Almighty God puts it into the mind of the “beast” and its “ten horns” to rid themselves of the ‘great harlot’. Then, to complete matters, the conquering King of kings and Lord of lords will destroy every last escaping one of organized religion. Thereafter, when religion’s estranged allies turn upon Jehovah’s covenant people and seek to kill them off, the King will also destroy the “beast” and its “ten horns”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> All you freedom-upholders, keep shooting the arrow of Jehovah’s truth of deliverance, and keep smiting with suchlike, until the last of the Lord’s “other sheep” has been hunted out and gathered to the right side of Jehovah’s enthroned King. By helping others to freedom, you will be successful in standing fast for the freedom whereunto the King at the temple has made us free. So doing, we shall never be dragged into the bondage of iniquity under the rod of the wicked, but Jehovah’s promise will be fulfilled toward us: “As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord [Jehovah] is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.” (Ps. 125:2,3) With clean hands, only those who have maintained their stand for God-given, Christian freedom shall go into eternal life and liberty in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">32 With what end In view must freedom-upholders keep shooting such arrows, and why will such &lt;&nbsp;lean-handed ones not be dragged back into bondage under iniquity’s rod?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark14"></a>JUDAH, FAVORED SON OF JACOB</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">€« TUDAH, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: I thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art sone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Gen. 49:8-10) More than thirty-six centuries ago these words of great prophetic import came from the lips of a dying man, Jacob, the father of the nation of Israel. They were addressed to the fourth of his twelve sons, Judah, and marked the Israelite tribe bearing that name as destined to be outstanding in the national life of the typical Theocracy, and blessed above the others by Jehovah. Though uttered in the dim past, in 1713 B C., the latter part of this prophecy is just now having its final fulfillment, in this day of A.D. 1943. Let us examine with interest, therefore, the life history of this favored son of Jacob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While Jacob was serving Laban twenty years for his two wives and his cattle, there were born unto him eleven sons, among them Judah, by his wife Leah. At that time Leah said: “Now will I praise the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font4"> : therefore she called his name Judah,” meaning “praise”. (Gen. 29:35) Judah’s early boyhood was spent in Padan-aram, and when he was still a young lad he traveled with the family to the land of Canaan. There, years later, when Judah was approximately twenty-eight, first specific mention is made of his conduct. It is to his shame. He, with nine of his brothers, was tending the flocks at Dothan. Coming towards them they spied the eleventh son, their hated half brother Joseph, the “dreamer”. Conspiracy was hatched: “And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now therefore, and let us slay him.” Reuben and Judah were the only dissenters. Judah raised the counter-proposal: “What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood <sup>1 </sup>Come, and let us sell him.” To a band of Midianite and Ishmaelite merchantmen bound for Egypt they sold the lad for twenty pieces of silver. (Gen. 37:18-28) Judah, though not favoring murder, stood with the others in the conspiracy against the innocent youngster, and both he and Reuben participated in covering up the crime. Judah was not guiltless, just as those remaining in anti-God “Christendom” and following and backing up her religious leaders are not guiltless, but will partake of her plagues and destruction. (Matt. 15:14; Rev. 18:4) Indeed, at this point Judah foreshadowed a class of persons that have envied and ill-treated the true followers of Christ Jesus because they noted that such Christians had greater favor from God, having a better vision of his purposes and seeing the requirement of obeisance by all to the King Christ Jesus. (Gen. 37:5-11; Phil. 2:9-11) After the shameful bargain Judah’s conclusion, shared by his brethren, was that he was for ever rid of this young half brother who had tormented him with the truth, and that he had also profited by receiving some filthy lucre from the merchants Never did he expect to see this troublesome dreamer again</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereafter Judah married Shuah, a Canaanite, and by her had three sons, Er, Onan and Shelah. Er was wicked in the Lord’s sight, and was slain. The levirate law required Onan to raise up seed to his brother through Er’s wife, Tamar. Onan refused, and suffered destruction. Judah then told Tamar to wait till Shelah be grown, that he might fulfill the levirate marriage. Judah did not abide by his word or the law. Shelah was grown, yet the promise remained unfulfilled. Judah himself thereafter unwittingly became involved with Tamar and married her and she gave birth to twins, Pharez and Zarah. Judah became the father of Pharez by Tamar, his daughter-in-law, under conditions which the critics of the Bible would call disreputable. It clearly appears that Jehovah maneuvered the circumstances under which Pharez was born, that he might be a link of the genealogy leading up to the King. From him descended the royal house of David, and subsequently the man Jesus. (Ruth 4:18-22; Matt. 1:3) The “holier than thou” religionists decry the manner of maintaining the royal line of Judah, which was ofttimes precarious and endangered by the Devil’s interference, and lose sight of the vital issue involved. Tamar had respect for God's law and his name and sincerely desired to serve him and his people. She stepped into the breach at the opportune time to preserve the name of Judah, concerning which tribe Jehovah had given his promise that it should produce his Vindicator-King, the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Rev. 5:5) Judah acknowledged Ins injustice toward Tamar, saying: “She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.<sup>-</sup>’—Gen. 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twenty years have now elapsed since the selling of Joseph into slavery. The first year of a seven-year famine has begun. Jacob says to his sons - “I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. get you down thither, and buy for us from thence.” (Gen. 42.2) Joseph’s half brothers journey into Egypt, his full brother Benjamin remaining with his aged father. Joseph had been made prime minister of Egypt and the food administrator of the land. He recognizes his brothers when they appear before him, though he is not remembered by them. Joseph accuses them of being spies; this for the purpose of a test. They had mentioned a “younger brother&quot;, and now they were “to be proved” to see if they had undereone a change of heart since their criminal treatment of another “younger brother<sup>-</sup>’, Joseph. (Gen. 42.14,15) They must bring Benjamin to Egypt. Their conduct toward Benjamin was to be the touchstone upon which the test was founded. Likewise today it is the treatment rendered toward the Lord’s anointed witnesses that determines the judgment of the peoples of earth, whether they be separated as “sheep” or herded into the “goat” class. (Matt. 25:40,45) Holding Simeon as a hostage Joseph sends the others on their homeward trek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of time the famine, approaching the end of its second year, makes a second trip into Egypt imperative if Jacob's household is to survive. But Jacob is unwilling to meet the terms of sending Benjamin with his brothers. Judah steps forward. “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.” (Gen. 43: 8, 9) In the face of this solemn oath by Judah the patriarch relents, and the second trip into Egypt starts, Benjamin accompanying the caravan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After feasting with Joseph in Egypt, the travelers prepare for their departure to Canaan, laden with provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now a most heart-searching test was arranged for by Joseph He instructed that his silver cup be hid in the sack of Benjamin. The account of how the travelers were subsequently overtaken on their homeward journey, accused of the theft of the prime minister’s cup, their goods searched and the damaging evidence found in Benjamin’s sack, and their return to stand trial before Joseph, is a familiar one. The judgment: Benjamin sentenced to slavery m Egypt; the others free to return to Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here was a golden opportunity to rid themselves of Benjamin, their father’s favorite at that time, if they still had the same disposition manifested years ago toward Joseph. Would they seize upon the circumstantial evidence against Benjamin and make capital of it? No! A complete change of heart -was strikingly demonstrated by the impassioned plea for the young lad voiced by Judah, acting as group spokesman. Climaxing his stirring appeal Judah magnanimously concludes: “Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.” (Gen. 44:18-34) The fervor with which Judah argued the case erased all doubt as to his change of heart. His about-face was complete, unquestionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is apparent that Judah prefigured a class of persons who at one time were antagonistic to the consecrated spiritual children of God, the brethren of Christ, but who, upon learning of their error, are of a contrite heart and desire to make amends and to do good wherein they had previously rendered evil. As was Benjamin, so the anointed today are falsely accused, all of which is permitted by the Greater Joseph, Christ Jesus, and serves as a test upon the people of good-will. Sueh persons boldly and willingly come to the fore and speak in defense of God’s anointed witnesses, stand shoulder to shoulder with them, and share their trials and persecutions, and joys, experienced in Kingdom service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Joseph, greatly moved by Judah’s eloquent and touching plea, could restrain himself no longer. He made himself known to them as their long-lost brother Joseph, sent them home laden with gifts, and with instructions to bring their father and families into Egypt, where there was food His parting injunction was: “See that ye fall not out by the way.” (Gen. 45:24) Now Christ Jesus sends both the anointed and the “other sheep” throughout the earth with the gracious invitation that all of good-will come to the Greater Joseph and the Greater Pharaoh for life-sustaining spiritual food, and in the pursuance of this commission they must not ‘fall out by the way’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Judah and all those of Jacob’s family had come down into Egypt Pharaoh said to Joseph concerning his brethren: “If thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.” Here were service privileges. Inasmuch as Judah took the leading part among the ten half brothers throughout their trying experiences in Egypt, he was doubtless counted a ‘man of activity’. Neither are the Lord’s “other sheep” at this time slothful, but energetically busy themselves in Theocratic activities. Their zeal is rewarded by added service privileges of responsibility, and by ample nourishment in these times of spiritual famine in “Christendom”.—Gen. 47: 11.12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No further disclosures of Judah’s life appear in the Divine Record. His descendants became the foremost of the twelve tribes of Israel. (Judg. 1:1-4; 1 Chron. 5:2) The national history of Israel proves the blessing pronounced at Genesis 49: S-10 was not the mumbling of an idle whim of an old man on his deathbed, but was prophecy directed by God. Through that tribe came the man Christ Jesus; to him God’s covenant people have been gathered, and now the people of good-will, prototyped by Judah, are being gathered into that ‘'one fold” of ‘‘praisers” of Jehovah’s name. Judah's favor was from Jehovah. ‘The Lord refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose the tribe of Judah, which he loved.’—Ps. &quot;8:65-68.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the peoples of earth profit by this prophetic drama. All nations are gathered before the throne of the Greater Joseph for judgment. The dividing issue that separates the “sheep” from the “goats” is their reaction to the work of his spiritual brethren, and the false charges hurled against his followers. As Joseph counted Judah’s actions with respect to Benjamin as done unto himself, so Christ Jesus regards the treatment accorded the ‘least of his brethren'. (Matt. 25:31-40) As Judah stood forth for Benjamin, people of good-will stand with God’s people in this world crisis. Life in the New World shall be their reward.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL ASSEMBLY, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On April 16, just two days before the Convention,‘we were informed that the police permit had been denied, with a long list of charges against the Society, the Branch servant, and others. Appeal was made above the head of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">delegado</span><span class="font4"> who rendered this decision. When it reached the third superior he refused to grant an audience, but sent word to the first </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">delegado</span><span class="font4"> to hear the matter. The latter, to whom information had been given by a prejudiced subordinate, on hearing the presentation by the brethren and on checking up on some of the charges, agreed that the Society and brethren were victims of persecution by those holding divergent opinions. He granted the permission, a condition of which was that a representative of the police should attend each session of the assembly. Agreed! And in the opening address such representative was welcomed and the hope expressed that he would gain information to enable him to take his stand on the side of The Theocracy and receive life. There was no evidence of an officer present at any other meeting; although the manager of the hall had warned that the police always examined the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">carteiras</span><span class="font4"> of identity of foreigners and excluded or jailed any subjects of the Axis powers, no one was asked to present his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">carteira.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“An airmail letter had been sent to President Knorr asking the Memorial date and other needed information, but before it could have been received the mail began to come in (after a four months’ interruption) bringing the March 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 1943 Calendar, and then the 1943 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font4">Our joy knew no bounds. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao</span><span class="font4"> for May was printed, carrying the annual report for Brazil taken from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> and a talk on ‘Baptism’; and the Brazilian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for May containing the article Tn Remembrance of the King' from the English March 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">Such discourses were given during the Assembly, after which the magazines were released Having 5,000 copies of the Brazilian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> containing the speech ‘Peace— Can It Last?’ we arranged a public discourse on this subject for Wednesday afternoon, April 21, advertised by information marchers with placards, 300 window cards, and 20,000 handbills. On the reverse side of the handbills the following notice was printed at the bottom: ‘If you are interested in the subject of this lecture and cannot attend, fill in the coupon, mail it to the address below, and you will receive a copy of the lecture free ’ This has given contact with a number of people interested in the subject, requests continue to come in, and back-calls are being made upon these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Assembly opened with a welcome speech by the chairman at 2 p.m., Sunday, April 18, followed by a discourse on ‘The New World’, which caused much astonishment at the disclosure that the service of preaching ‘this gospel of the kingdom’ with the magazines had been officially stopped in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Ninety attended the Memorial, April 19, at which the discourse Tn Remembrance of the King’ was given; 11 partook of the emblems, the same number as Jesus served at the first Memorial. On April 20, after field service, at 2 p.m., the study of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informante</span><span class="font4"> began, followed by the lecture ‘Comfort All That Mourn’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This lecture and the release of the booklet containing it were of special significance. The first shipment of these booklets from the United States had been lost on a torpedoed</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">vessel. As we were receiving the news of this loss came the announcement of a second shipment under way. The vessel carrying this second shipment, trying to avoid submarines, went on a rock and nearly sank. Help arriving, the cargo was transferred to another vessel and finally arrived in port. The cargo was in such confusion that it was some time before any was released from the customs. From day to day the dispatcher promised our shipment, but not until Tuesday, April 20, did a few cartons of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort</span><span class="font4"> booklets arrive, just in time for release at the afternoon discourse. The brethren were so thrilled at the release and hearing how Jehovah had preserved the booklets and brought them to us that they went out on the streets with them immediately, and the whole 5,000 disappeared like snow in the sun. This short but intensive work was followed by a study of the Brazilian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> closing another day of festivity for the publishers of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On April 21, a national holiday, and the last day of this Assembly, the field service was augmented by distribution of invitations to the public lecture at 3 p.m. After a quick lunch there ensued an intensive publication with placards and with invitations, 20,000 being distributed. A number of curious persons attended this lecture, at the close of which </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> containing the discourse was presented to the audience. Perfect order reigned, and, as the lecture ended, we felt happy for the protecting hand of Jehovah against His enemies who wanted to disturb our Assembly. At 8 p.m. the Branch servant spoke briefly, closing the convention. He offered a declaration answering the accusations of the enemies who had tried to prexent this four-day assembly, and which was unanimously adopted. Ten persons were immersed, one of whom has already entered the pioneer service, and others show great joy at having found The Theocracy. At this assembly the organization setup for the New World Assembly of last September was followed, and it enabled brethren who had never before had such responsibilities to perform in an orderly and satisfactory way, so that not an item was omitted, and the entire program was carried out promptly. During intervals and preceding the lectures, songs of praise to Jehovah were sung. Interesting were the experiences of brethren who came from distant cities with all manner of difficulties of transportation and documents. One brother traveled nine days, when normally he would have spent two, reaching the convention, however, to participate in the blessings which were poured out by the God of all consolation and comfort, Jehovah, so that we might be strong and ‘more than conquerors through him that loved us’. All together, 5,649 books and booklets were placed at meetings and in the field.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">for $5. This is from a man 77 years old who only recently took his stand for the New World and is now a Theocratic publisher. After reading the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article ‘Everything for the Issue’ he immediately discontinued the use of tobacco, after having been an addict for 62 years. This dear sheep is very poor in this world’s goods, but has saved sums that were formerly spent for the ‘filthy weed’ and he now offers this to the Society to be used in the preaching of the Kingdom message, as Jesus commanded.” —Indiana.</span></p>

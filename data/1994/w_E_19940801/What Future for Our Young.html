<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE nuclear threat​—whether from terrorists’ bombs or from accidents at nuclear plants—​looms over all. You may well worry particularly about young ones, including your own children or grandchildren. How saddening to realize that a nuclear threat endangers the health and future of any child.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But take heart. There is reason for you to be optimistic about the future of young ones. The basis for hope centers, not on human efforts to protect our young, but on a future resting in the hands of our Creator.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When God’s Son, Jesus, taught in the Middle East, he demonstrated concern for young ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:36-41:9:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 9:36, 37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:42-41:9:42" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:13-41:10:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 10:13-16</a>) The Bible shows that similar concern will be reflected when God finally ends the nuclear threat and establishes a global paradise. Our young can enjoy that, and you can too.</p>

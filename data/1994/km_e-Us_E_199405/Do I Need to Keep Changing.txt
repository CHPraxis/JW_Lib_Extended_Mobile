Do I Need to Keep Changing?
Every issue of Our Kingdom Ministry provides a variety of Scriptural presentations that we can use when witnessing. Many publishers who are quite active are eager to get new ideas and use different approaches. Our Kingdom Ministry accommodates them by supplying several suggestions each month.
It may be, however, that you do not feel the need to keep changing what you use. You may have only a few hours available each month to share in the house-to-house work. Over a period of time, you may have developed certain presentations that you feel comfortable with, and you get good results using them. You may depend upon some often-used texts, including Psalm 37:9-11, 2 Peter 3:13, Revelation 21:4, and others. If so, there is no need for you to feel obligated to change frequently to something else. Our primary goal is to share the Kingdom hope with others and to help them learn what they must do to merit Jehovah’s blessing. If you find timely and inviting presentations in the Reasoning book that you prefer to use and you are getting a good response with them, do not hesitate to use them.

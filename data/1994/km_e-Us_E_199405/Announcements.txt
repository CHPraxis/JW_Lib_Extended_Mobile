Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines, as well as any brochure (except the School brochure). Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. June: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? July: A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. August: Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, and What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It? NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.
▪ Before undertaking a Kingdom Hall construction project, the elders should contact the Regional Building Committee for their area. The regional committees have been provided information that can assist congregations in making wise decisions. It is prudent to consider suggestions offered by the regional committees before purchasing such items as chairs, wall covering, carpet, or heating and air-conditioning equipment. While the Society does not recommend any suppliers, information is shared with the Regional Building Committees concerning suppliers that have previously provided quality materials in a reliable manner.
▪ Congregations may now begin requesting New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References/​Insight on the Scriptures in Spanish. This is available on 5 1/4-inch 1.2-megabyte or 3 1/2-inch 1.44-megabyte diskettes. A computer with a hard disk having a minimum of 20 megabytes of free space is required. Until this item is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists.
▪ The Watchtower Library​—1993 Edition will soon be shipped to congregations. Commercial CD-ROMs costing from $25 to $50 or more contain a single encyclopedia or a few reference works. Watchtower Library will access The Watchtower back to 1950 and many other of the Society’s publications back to 1970.

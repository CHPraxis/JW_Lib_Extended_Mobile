<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature to be used during <strong>May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines, as well as any brochure (except the <em>School </em>brochure). Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. <strong>June: </strong><em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em><strong>July: </strong>A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. <strong>August: </strong>Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: <em>Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, </em>and <em>What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It? </em>NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ <em>Before </em>undertaking a Kingdom Hall construction project, the elders should contact the Regional Building Committee for their area. The regional committees have been provided information that can assist congregations in making wise decisions. It is prudent to consider suggestions offered by the regional committees <em>before </em>purchasing such items as chairs, wall covering, carpet, or heating and air-conditioning equipment. While the Society does not recommend any suppliers, information is shared with the Regional Building Committees concerning suppliers that have previously provided quality materials in a reliable manner.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations may now begin requesting <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References/​Insight on the Scriptures </em>in Spanish. This is available on 5 1/4-inch 1.2-megabyte or 3 1/2-inch 1.44-megabyte diskettes. A computer with a hard disk having a minimum of 20 megabytes of free space is required. Until this item is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">□ <strong>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE WORK: </strong>Many set aside or budget an amount that they place in the contribution boxes labeled: “Contributions for the Society’s Worldwide Work​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.” Each month congregations forward these amounts either to the world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, or to the nearest branch office.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">□ <strong>GIFTS: </strong>Voluntary donations of money may be sent directly to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the Society’s office that serves your country. Jewelry or other valuables may also be donated. A brief letter stating that such is an outright gift should accompany these contributions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">□ <strong>CONDITIONAL-DONATION ARRANGEMENT: </strong>Money may be given to the Watch Tower Society to be held in trust until the donor’s death, with the provision that in the case of personal need, it will be returned to the donor.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">□ <strong>INSURANCE: </strong>The Watch Tower Society may be named as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy or in a retirement/​pension plan. The Society should be informed of any such arrangement.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">□ <strong>BANK ACCOUNTS: </strong>Bank accounts, certificates of deposit, or individual retirement accounts may be placed <em>in trust for </em>or made <em>payable on death to </em>the Watch Tower Society, in accord with local bank requirements. The Society should be informed of any such arrangements.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">□ <strong>STOCKS AND BONDS: </strong>Stocks and bonds may be donated to the Watch Tower Society either as an outright gift or under an arrangement whereby the income continues to be paid to the donor.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">□ <strong>REAL ESTATE: </strong>Salable real estate may be donated to the Watch Tower Society either by making an outright gift or by reserving a life estate to the donor, who can continue to live therein during his or her lifetime. One should contact the Society before deeding any real estate to the Society.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">□ <strong>WILLS AND TRUSTS: </strong>Property or money may be bequeathed to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania by means of a legally executed will, or the Society may be named as a beneficiary of a trust agreement. A trust benefiting a religious organization may provide certain tax advantages. A copy of the will or trust agreement should be sent to the Society.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">□ <strong>PLANNED GIVING: </strong>The Society has assembled information on “Planned Giving.” Those who are planning to make a special gift to the Society now or to leave a bequest at death may find this information helpful. That is especially true if they wish to accomplish some family goal or estate-planning objective while using tax benefits to minimize the cost of the gift or bequest. This information can be obtained by writing to the Society at the address shown below.</p>

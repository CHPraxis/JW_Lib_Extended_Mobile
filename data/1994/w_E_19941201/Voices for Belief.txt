Voices for Belief
AS THE last century ended, voices espousing science, philosophy, and secularism were taking a toll on belief in God and the Bible’s inspiration.
But they were not the only voices to be heard. Many researchers saw that much could be said in support of belief in God rather than atheism. Their studies also turned up abundant evidence that the Bible is the inspired Word of God.
One prominent voice was C. T. Russell. Millions read his 1886 volume The Divine Plan of the Ages. A powerful chapter in it was “The Existence of a Supreme Intelligent Creator Established.”
In following decades, Russell authored articles, tracts, and books that provided potent reasons for belief in God and the Bible. These were published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Its second president, J. F. Rutherford, wrote Creation (1927) and other works that amplified the voice for belief.
That society has recently prepared additional up-to-date information on these matters. Jehovah’s Witnesses can provide such for your thoughtful consideration.
If you would welcome further information or would like to have someone call to conduct a free home Bible study with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 2.

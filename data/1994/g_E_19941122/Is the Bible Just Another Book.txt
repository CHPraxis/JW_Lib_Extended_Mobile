Is the Bible Just Another Book?
If so, why has it been so viciously attacked throughout history? Can you trust the Bible? Did the miracles it records really happen? Has science proved the Bible wrong?
Satisfying answers to such questions are found in the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? A librarian and teacher in Budapest, Hungary, was deeply impressed by the book. In a letter addressed to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Hungary, the person explained:
“One of the pocket-​size books you are distributing aroused my interest. The title is The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? I lead a group in our school and teach them the Bible. But nowhere could I get this little book. If possible, could you please send me 30 copies so that more and more young people may turn to Jesus Christ and learn the way to true life?”
If you would like to receive a copy of this hardbound 192-​page book or to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

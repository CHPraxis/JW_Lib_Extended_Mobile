“I Am Interested in Learning More”
A MAN from Colorado, U.S.A., wrote the above last December in a letter to the publishers of this magazine. He explained:
“Although you wouldn’t consider me a religious person by most people’s standards, I have always believed there has to be more to life than what we see and hear in our day-​to-​day existence. I have always had a spiritual commitment, although not to a specific religion.
“However, lately I have found myself in some fairly distressing situations and find myself lacking the inner strength to cope. Problems at home and work have increased my level of anxiety to a point I have not experienced before. . . .
“Strangely enough, when I was at the height of my frustration, I stumbled across one of your pieces of literature in a shopping mall. Your views regarding the Holy Father are refreshing, and I am interested in learning more, but I’m not sure where to turn.
“I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can give me to learn more about Jehovah’s Witnesses and your beliefs. As I mentioned, I found it strange to stumble across one of your pieces of literature at the height of my frustration​—it may be a sign of divine guidance.”
This man was sent a copy of a book that presents the Bible-​based beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, entitled You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. If you would like to receive a copy of this 256-​page hardcover publication or wish to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or the appropriate address listed on page 5.

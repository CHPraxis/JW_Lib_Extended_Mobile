<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EVIDENTLY having more money does not make people happier. Says the magazine <em>Psychology Today: </em>“Once above the poverty line, increases in income have surprisingly little relation to personal happiness.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This was confirmed in a <em>New York Times </em>obituary of October 29, 1993, that carried the headline: “Doris Duke, 80, Heiress Whose Great Wealth Couldn’t Buy Happiness, Is Dead.” The article said: “Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“All that money is a problem sometimes,” Duke confided to a friend. “After I’ve gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?” The <em>Times </em>noted: “Her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, Jean Paul Getty, once reputed to be the richest man in the world, said: “Money doesn’t necessarily have any connection with happiness. Maybe with unhappiness.” And Jane Fonda, a famous Hollywood actress, who during the 1970’s received half a million dollars per movie, said: “I’ve had my taste of wealth and all the material things. They don’t mean a thing. There’s a psychiatrist that goes with every swimming pool out here, not to mention divorces and children who hate their parents.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While wealth alone will never bring happiness, neither does abject poverty. Thus, a wise man long ago said: “Give me neither poverty nor riches.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:8-20:30:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:8, 9</a>) Another Bible writer noted that what a person needs in order to be happy is “godly devotion along with self-​sufficiency. For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:6-54:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>.</p>

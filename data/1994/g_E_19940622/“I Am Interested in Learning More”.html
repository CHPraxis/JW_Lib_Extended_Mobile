<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MAN from Colorado, U.S.A., wrote the above last December in a letter to the publishers of this magazine. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Although you wouldn’t consider me a religious person by most people’s standards, I have always believed there has to be more to life than what we see and hear in our day-​to-​day existence. I have always had a spiritual commitment, although not to a specific religion.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“However, lately I have found myself in some fairly distressing situations and find myself lacking the inner strength to cope. Problems at home and work have increased my level of anxiety to a point I have not experienced before. . . .</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Strangely enough, when I was at the height of my frustration, I stumbled across one of your pieces of literature in a shopping mall. Your views regarding the Holy Father are refreshing, and I am interested in learning more, but I’m not sure where to turn.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can give me to learn more about Jehovah’s Witnesses and your beliefs. As I mentioned, I found it strange to stumble across one of your pieces of literature at the height of my frustration​—it may be a sign of divine guidance.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This man was sent a copy of a book that presents the Bible-​based beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, entitled <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>If you would like to receive a copy of this 256-​page hardcover publication or wish to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

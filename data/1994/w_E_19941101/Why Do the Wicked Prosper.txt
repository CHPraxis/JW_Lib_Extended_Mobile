Why Do the Wicked Prosper?
“WHY is it that the wicked themselves keep living?” This question was asked long ago by faithful Job, and it has been repeated many times since his day. Likely it is on the minds of many people in the territory of the former Yugoslavia (such as the woman shown on our cover) who mourn over those who suffer in a tragic war. Why do wicked people survive and even prosper? As Job noted, often “their houses are peace itself, free from dread, and the rod of God is not upon them.”​—Job 21:7, 9.
Does this mean that there is no value in serving God, loving one’s neighbor, and abstaining from doing wrong? By no means! The Bible gives us the right perspective when it says: “Do not strive to outdo the evildoers or emulate those who do wrong. For like grass they soon wither, and fade like the green of spring. Trust in the LORD and do good.”​—Psalm 37:1-3, The New English Bible.
Yes, the apparent prosperity of the wicked is just temporary. In fact, their lives are very short, while those who serve God have a glorious hope for the future. Soon, God’s promise will be fulfilled: “[God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:4) Only the righteous, not the wicked, will see that time. What an encouragement to draw close to God and learn to do his will, however wicked those around us may be!

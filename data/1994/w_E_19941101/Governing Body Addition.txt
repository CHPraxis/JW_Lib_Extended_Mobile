Governing Body Addition
WITH a view to building up the personnel of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, effective July 1, 1994, an additional member has been added to the 11 elders now serving. The new member is Gerrit Lösch.
Brother Lösch entered full-time service on November 1, 1961, and graduated from the 41st class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. He served in the circuit and district work in Austria from 1963 to 1976. He married in 1967, and he and his wife, Merete, later served for 14 years as members of the Austria Bethel family in Vienna. Four years ago they were transferred to the Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, where Brother Lösch has served in the Executive Offices and as an assistant to the Service Committee. With his varied experience in the European field and his knowledge of German, English, Romanian, and Italian, he will make a valuable contribution to the work of the Governing Body.

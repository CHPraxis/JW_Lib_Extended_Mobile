<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For centuries Jews, Muslims, and Christians have made their way to this place.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You can visit it in the ancient city of Hebron, south of Jerusalem. This structure is called both Haram el-Khalil and the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Yes, this is widely accepted as the burial place of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their respective wives Sarah, Rebekah, and Leah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Recall from the Bible that upon the death of his beloved wife, Sarah, Abraham bought as a burial site a cave and some land at Machpelah, near Hebron. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:2-1:23:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 23:2-20</a>) Later, Abraham too was buried here, as were other family members. Centuries afterward, around the traditional burial site, Herod the Great constructed an impressive building that in time was altered and enlarged by conquerors, reflecting their own religious persuasions.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Upon entering, you see six cenotaphs (monuments or empty tombs). The inset shows the one for Isaac, son of Abraham. Near it are holes through the floor, which have been used to gain access to what lies beneath. Investigators have found chambers that may have held numerous ancient bones.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What of Abraham? If he was laid to rest in a cave now beneath this site, he is long dead, correct? Most visitors would agree. Yet a prophet greater than Abraham said that in a sense Abraham still lives. How? And what bearing might this have upon your faith?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please read the article “Your Dead Loved Ones​—Where Are They?” (Page 3) It presents what that great prophet said about Abraham’s being alive, which information can be of immense value to you and to your family.</p>

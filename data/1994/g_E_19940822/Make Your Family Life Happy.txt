Make Your Family Life Happy
WHEN a patient in South Carolina, U.S.A., sent the tract Enjoy Family Life to one of her nurses, the nurse phoned to thank her for it. The nurse said she had shared the tract with her husband and that they had read it together appreciatively. In fact, the nurse said they could not believe something so positive was available to help families.
The patient explained: “The nurse told me that the information was exactly what she and her husband had been discussing in terms of ideal and positive things in the family but that they had no idea anything on the subject was available in printed form. She ended the phone call by saying she keeps the little tract with her everywhere she goes and reads it over and over. She said that if I had any other information on family life to please let her see it.”
The patient sent the nurse the book Making Your Family Life Happy and made plans to get together with the nurse to discuss it with her. Perhaps you too would appreciate information to help make your family life happier.

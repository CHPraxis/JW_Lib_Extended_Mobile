Do you believe that man possesses an immortal soul that survives the death of the body? Millions, maybe billions, believe that man is endowed with a soul that moves on to another world or plane of existence at death or is reincarnated as another creature.

 7. “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) The word “soul” translates the Hebrew neʹphesh, “that which breathes.” “The first man, Adam, as scripture says, became a living soul.” Note, “became,” not “was given.”​—1 Corinthians 15:45, The Jerusalem Bible.
 8. “My sin is in front of me constantly. Against you, you alone, I have sinned, and what is bad in your eyes I have done.”​—Psalm 51:3, 4.

There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) “As the soul of the father so likewise the soul of the son​—to me they belong.

[Footnotes]
The expression “immortal soul” appears nowhere in the Bible. The word “immortality” (Greek, a·tha·na·siʹa) appears only three times in the Bible and never in relation to the soul. (1 Corinthians 15:53, 54; 1 Timothy 6:16) For a more detailed consideration of what happens at death and the true hope for the dead, see the publication Reasoning From the Scriptures, pages 168-75 (Hell), 333-40 (Resurrection), 375-84 (Soul, Spirit), published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.

“On a Tour of All the Cities”
WHILE on earth Christ Jesus “set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom.” (Matthew 9:35) Those desiring to follow in his footsteps were likewise called upon to preach in the cities of the world. There they would encounter the problems common to cities and be forced to cope with them.
A historical tour of cities presents a picture of the ups and downs of thousands of years of human existence, the joys and the heartaches of human endeavors to achieve happiness. A candid look at cities impresses upon us the fact that the entire human race is but a single family, faced with common problems. There should be no room today for nationalistic pride or racial prejudice.
Sad to say, many people do not know much about cities, not even their location. When U.S. university students were asked in the mid-1980’s to locate certain cities, some of them put Dublin (Ireland) in the United States and Lima (Peru) in Italy.
A test carried out a few years earlier at another university revealed that almost half of the students were unable to locate London on a world map. Some put it in Iceland, others in Continental Europe. The professor conducting the test lamented that 42 percent of the students “lost” London completely. Even more embarrassing, 8 percent “lost” the American city where the test was being conducted!
But Americans are evidently not the only ones who are weak in geographical knowledge. At the end of the 1980’s, a test of students in ten nations showed that the Swedes do best and the Americans score sixth. The Academy of Sciences of the former Soviet Union found that 13 percent of the Soviet students surveyed were unable to locate even their own country on a world map. Academy member Vladimir Andriyenkov said with embarrassment: “The results are unbelievable.”
What about you? How good is your knowledge of geography in general and of cities in particular? How about testing yourself by means of the quiz on page 10? You can learn some interesting facts by “Taking a Closer Look at Cities.”
In the next issue of Awake!, we will take a closer look at five cities. They are a special kind of city that for thousands of years was completely unknown. But by the turn of the century, it is estimated, there will be at least 20 of them. Over half of them will be in Asia. What type of city might it be?

7. At the start of the 19th century, Cologne was reputedly one of the three dirtiest cities in the world​—Calcutta, Constantinople, and Cologne—​for which reason French soldiers stationed there “covered their faces in handkerchiefs soaked in Eau de Cologne to keep at bay the smell of urine that permeated the city.”​—Kölner Stadt-​Anzeiger.

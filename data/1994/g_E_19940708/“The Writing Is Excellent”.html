<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter of appreciation came to the Watch Tower Society from a reader in California, U.S.A., in which she stated:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The <em>Awake! </em>on ‘Loneliness​—What You Can Do About It’ (September 22, 1993) compels me to pick up my pen and tell you how much I have been enjoying the magazines lately. The writing is excellent, and the articles on loneliness were so well written and poetic. Also, I appreciated the honesty of the articles in putting the responsibility for loneliness with the lonely person himself. Truly the articles express Jehovah’s deep love and caring concern for his people.”</p>

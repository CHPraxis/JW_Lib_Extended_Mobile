“The Writing Is Excellent”
A letter of appreciation came to the Watch Tower Society from a reader in California, U.S.A., in which she stated:
“The Awake! on ‘Loneliness​—What You Can Do About It’ (September 22, 1993) compels me to pick up my pen and tell you how much I have been enjoying the magazines lately. The writing is excellent, and the articles on loneliness were so well written and poetic. Also, I appreciated the honesty of the articles in putting the responsibility for loneliness with the lonely person himself. Truly the articles express Jehovah’s deep love and caring concern for his people.”
The magazines The Watchtower and Awake! are distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide. The former, which presents Bible based discussions of topical issues, is published in 115 languages, with an average printing each issue of over 16 million. The latter, which offers educational information on a wide range of subjects, is available in 73 languages and has an average printing of almost 13 million.
If you would like to receive sample issues of these magazines, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses at a Kingdom Hall in your area, or write to the address nearest to you as listed on page 5.

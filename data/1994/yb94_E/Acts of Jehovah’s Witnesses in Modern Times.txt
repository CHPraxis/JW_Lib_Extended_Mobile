Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Greece
Ancient Greece, renowned for achievements in art, literature, and architecture, became one of the first lands in Europe to receive the good news of God’s Kingdom. In modern times, Jehovah’s Witnesses have endured tremendous hardships as they have worked to reestablish pure Christianity in this land. Their struggle makes a gripping account.
Haiti
Haiti has had an interesting, though turbulent, history. Black heroes, famous writers, and gifted artists have been part of the changing scene. Now, genuine hope is being held out to those who seek to be more than mere memories from the past. Read how Haitians are responding to the good news of everlasting life in a new world.
Poland
The faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Poland has been tested as in a crucible. Schemes have been devised repeatedly to discredit the Witnesses​—if possible, to destroy their organization. But no weapon formed against them has had lasting success. May your reading of these experiences strengthen your determination to trust fully in Jehovah.

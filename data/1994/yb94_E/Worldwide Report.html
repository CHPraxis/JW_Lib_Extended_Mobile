<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Africa and Islands Nearby</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Africa is a continent fragmented as a result of tribal and nationalistic strife. But <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-14</a> foretells that “a great crowd . . . out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” will become united in the worship of Jehovah, with the prospect of survival into his peaceful new world. Many thousands throughout Africa are giving convincing evidence that they are part of that happy throng.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Cape Town, <strong><em>South Africa, </em></strong>one of our sisters was taken aback when a householder interrupted her, asking: “What is your purpose?” She answered directly: “It is to start Bible studies with people.” To her surprise the man replied: “Well! Come in, let’s start now.” A fine discussion was held with this Jewish man, and our sister arranged to return with her husband. The man has made excellent progress. In addition to his study, he has read the Bible from cover to cover four times, and three times he has read the entire book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>He is also busy sharing the truth with his relatives. He is most grateful that Jehovah opened <span id="page43" class="pageNum" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>his eyes to the truth. The day our sister first called, he said to his family: “Come and meet these people, for God has sent them to us.” He had been contemplating suicide.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Family ties can play an important role in spreading the truth. An auxiliary pioneer started a study in a village in <strong><em>Mauritius. </em></strong>Darmen, a curious young neighbor boy, listened with interest. What he heard he repeated to his parents, especially his mother, a Hindu. She became convinced that what she was now learning was the truth, so she demolished the Hindu shrine in her garden. Darmen talked to all his relatives in that village​—brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, uncles, aunts, and cousins. When he learned about the daily text, he discussed that with them. Some evenings, over 30 shared in these discussions until late. After a few weeks, a special pioneer couple arranged to study with them. Thirteen from that family are now baptized; four others are unbaptized publishers. And Darmen? He is now married, and both he and his wife serve as special pioneers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Civil war has severely disrupted the lives of people in <strong><em>Liberia. </em></strong>When the publishers from Mano River were attending a convention in Monrovia, their home area came under attack and it was impossible for them to return all year. But one unbaptized publisher who had been left behind continued to preach. Though he did not feel qualified to use the Kingdom Hall, since he had not yet been baptized, he protected it from being looted. He explained that he had also endeavored to make “shepherding calls” on those who had previously been studying, to keep their interest in the truth alive, and he had conducted meetings in his own home. He was among those baptized at the “Divine Teaching” Convention this year.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The highlight of the year in the <strong><em>Central African Republic </em></strong>was the government decree on January 20, 1993, that <span id="page44" class="pageNum" data-no="44" data-before-text="44"></span>completely removed the ban on the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Though the brothers had enjoyed considerable liberty for several years, they now have legal recognition. This has made it possible for them to reopen their Kingdom Halls. Schools, hospitals, and many government offices in the country are not functioning because of lack of money for salaries. Yet, Jehovah’s Witnesses, despite their own financial problems, have repaired and painted all five Kingdom Halls in Bangui and are using them again as centers for pure worship.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The contrast between Jehovah’s Witnesses and other religious groups is clearly evident to some African observers. As a result of ethnic strife in the south of <strong><em>Zaire, </em></strong>a group of Kasaians who had been chased out by the Katangese took refuge at the house of the chief in a village near Kamina. After inquiring to learn what had happened, the chief asked: ‘Are there any of Jehovah’s Witnesses here among you?’ They made inspection, then replied: ‘No.’ The chief asked: ‘Why not? Are there none in the village?’ ‘There are some,’ they replied. ‘Then why are there not some here?’ the chief persisted. Finally, he said: ‘Now you see why Jehovah’s Witnesses say that your religions are false. Those who chased you away are members of your churches, but Jehovah’s Witnesses have not chased away their brothers. On the contrary, they have welcomed and protected them.’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Where illiteracy is a problem, publishers may find that they need to teach not only Bible truth but also reading and writing. A pioneer sister who was doing this for her students in <strong><em>Zimbabwe </em></strong>was surprised when they offered to pay for her services as a tutor. She later wrote: “I remembered Gehazi, Elisha’s servant, and how he was struck with leprosy. Therefore, I said to them, ‘My reward is seeing you making progress in learning the truth and practicing what you learn. I do not want your money.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:20-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><span id="page45" class="pageNum" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span><strong>Asia</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It was in the Orient that Jehovah planted the original paradise and placed the first humans. They failed to appreciate what Jehovah had done for them. But in our day, there are hundreds of thousands of Orientals who give evidence that they do appreciate Jehovah’s righteous ways, and they zealously share with others the news of God’s purpose to make all the earth a paradise.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">A sister in <strong><em>Japan </em></strong>who has to work full-time to support her family also enjoys pioneer service. How does she manage it? By making good use of the time she spends on the train each day. The ride takes an hour and a half each way. She has to be discreet, but as commuters ride the same train every day, she even makes return visits on people who listen to her. She places, on an average, 167 magazines every month and has started seven Bible studies there on the train.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Though a pioneer sister in <strong><em>Malaysia </em></strong>called several times at the home of a woman with whom she had been studying, no one was at home. However a fierce-looking neighbor <span id="page46" class="pageNum" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>always eyed her suspiciously. “Why not talk to this man?” the sister reasoned. “He is there everytime I come, and perhaps he can tell me where the woman is.” He greeted her rudely: “What do you want? What are you up to?” But, amazingly, after telling her that the woman had moved away, he listened to the Bible’s message and actually agreed to study, and he did so with some excitement too. The first time the study was held, his wife was also present, along with a colleague who was a staunch member of a sect of Christendom and who tried to stop the Bible study. But after observing the sister’s calm and reasoned replies to the verbal attacks, he told his colleague to mind his own business and let him study as he pleased. Progress was rapid. He was a spirit medium by profession, but when he learned that the Bible condemns spiritism, he promptly threw out all his spiritistic equipment. He and his wife are now regularly attending congregation meetings each week.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">When sharing in the house-to-house work, a pioneer sister in <strong><em>India </em></strong>met three girls who were attending college. Though Hindus, they accepted the offer of a Bible study because they were seeking answers to many questions. In time, they received and read the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>It was this that thoroughly convinced them of the wrongness of idol worship. They explained to their mother what they had learned, and she then disposed of her idol gods. The girls got rid of their Ouija board. Later they said: “The year 1992 was an unforgettable one for us. In January we stepped out of ‘Babylon the Great’ by removing the idols. In April we started attending the meetings regularly. In August we became unbaptized publishers. In October all four of us got baptized. In November two of us became regular auxiliary pioneers, and in December we were conducting ten Bible studies, including one with our 71-year-old grandmother.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span id="page47" class="pageNum" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>Publishers in <strong><em>Thailand </em></strong>find that an increasing number of people in their territory are being harassed by the demons. A husband and wife in Nakhon Sawan lived in a house that was full of idols. As the couple progressed in their Bible study, the husband mentioned that all sorts of strange things were happening in their home and were hindering their sleep. He also said that when his wife tried to go to the Kingdom Hall, she felt as if someone was holding her back, preventing her from leaving the house. The publisher directed their attention to material in the brochure <em>Spirits of the Dead. </em>The man acknowledged that what it described was exactly what they were experiencing. He was shown from the Scriptures what he needed to do in order to have Jehovah’s blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:25-5:7:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 7:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:21</a>) The following day he asked the brothers to help him remove from his home all the idols as well as other religious objects​—enough to fill a pickup truck—​and to burn them in his presence outside the city. His faith was greatly strengthened when he saw that the idols, his former objects of devotion, were unable to save themselves. From that point on, the household experienced release from the power of the demons and made good spiritual progress.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Because of uncertainty as to what the future holds for them, many young people are searching for answers. Some are being helped by the brochure <em>Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! </em>and the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. </em>A Buddhist mother in <strong><em>Sri Lanka </em></strong>wrote: “I take this opportunity to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping my daughter find the correct way. I was very glad when I saw the book that you’ve given to my daughter. I think it is the most valuable gift she has got in her life. She is reading it over and over, and even I myself have read it. So, once again, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the beautiful present.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><span id="page48" class="pageNum" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In many lands, economic conditions are difficult. But Jehovah’s servants have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) Instead of mourning over unemployment, Witnesses in Finland have been seizing the opportunity to spend more time helping people to see why times are so difficult and why we need the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">What part are young publishers having in this? Here is an example: A sister in <strong><em>Finland </em></strong>was in the field service together with her five-year-old girl. They met a man who, because of prejudice, was not willing to talk to the sister. But when her daughter gave him a tract, he could not refuse it. Later on, when his wife found the tract on the kitchen table, she read it. She liked what it said about the hope of paradise. She ordered the <em>Live Forever </em>book from the Society and started to read it. When publishers again came to her door, a Bible study was started. Her husband opposed. Yet, after seeing how a Kingdom Hall was built in a couple of days, he said: “If Jehovah’s Witnesses can do things like this, there <span id="page49" class="pageNum" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>must be something much bigger behind the organization.” He also started to study, and both of them were baptized after one year.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Many congregations in <strong><em>Portugal </em></strong>cover their territory every week, and they are still finding sheeplike ones. One sister relates: “Before leaving for the service every morning, I pray to Jehovah to help me find someone interested in studying the Bible.” One day she arranged for a study with those working in a hairdresser’s shop. Later, when the study was moved to the sister’s home, only one person showed up. She said: ‘The others are not interested, but I am.’ Within a month she was conducting two studies herself. Soon she was baptized and entered the pioneer work.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Though united according to Gypsy (Romany) custom, a couple in <strong><em>Sweden </em></strong>got married in harmony with Swedish law, and they presented themselves for baptism as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1992. Because of the respect in which he is held by other Gypsies, the husband has been able to start many Bible studies. In January of 1993 he was conducting 21 studies. One study was with a group so large that he requested use of the Kingdom Hall. When the circuit overseer went with him for the study, 26 adult Gypsies were in the apartment, waiting for the study. But the new brother said: “I cannot understand where everybody is tonight. Usually we are between 40 and 50 persons here.” The study was conducted in three languages​—Swedish, Croatian, and Romany. What appeals to these people even more than the blessings of the new world is God’s love as well as the impartial and unprejudiced attitude evident right now among Jehovah’s people.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">With a view to avoiding duplication of work and making the best use of resources, major changes have been made in the work at a number of branches. The Netherlands and <span id="page50" class="pageNum" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>Switzerland were included. The <strong><em>Netherlands </em></strong>branch cares for Dutch translation; it also coordinates production and distribution of videocassettes for Europe. But the printing of Dutch magazines, as well as the storage and the shipping of literature for the Netherlands, is now being cared for by the branch in Germany. Similarly, the printing and shipping formerly done in <strong><em>Switzerland </em></strong>are now being handled in Germany. Some of the Bethel family who were serving at Emmen, the Netherlands, volunteered to help in other branches, so two were assigned to Britain, four to Germany, and seven to Nigeria, where the four-color press from the Netherlands is being installed. Equipment from Switzerland will be used to upgrade the printing in the Philippines, and a couple from Switzerland will go there to help for a while. Another brother from Switzerland is being transferred to Nigeria. Others will serve again as pioneers.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">For more than a hundred years, our brothers have been witnessing in <strong><em>Ireland, </em></strong>and their patient persistence continues to pay off. A publisher in Tipperary started a Bible study with a local man, Michael. In time, though, he tried to avoid the publisher. When the publisher realized what was happening, she and another sister went to the bar to find him because they felt that there was genuine interest. When they entered the bar, a hush settled over the place; everyone knew who the sisters were. The publishers simply reminded Michael of the study arrangements. After they left, he tried to cover it over by saying to the other men: “Sure, I was supposed to fix her cooker, and I forgot!” But he realized that he could not dodge the sisters anymore.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">After that, Michael made good progress. He married May, who, though she was at first suspicious of the warm interest of the sisters, did agree to study. Then Michael and May began to share with May’s sister Breda what they were <span id="page51" class="pageNum" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>learning. During 1993, all three of them got baptized. Meanwhile, May’s brother and his girlfriend, also Michael’s younger brother and his wife, began to study and to attend meetings. So, because our sister was persistent, seven people are benefiting from the truth.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Five-year-old Sara, in <strong><em>Austria, </em></strong>is a very outgoing child and frequently talks to people passing her house. On one occasion, she pointedly asked a young woman: “Do you smoke?” When the woman replied in the negative, Sara was ready with her next question: “Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” Somewhat bewildered, the woman answered, “Yes!” This led her to talk to Sara’s mother. She explained that, although she had been raised as a Witness, she had lost all contact. She asked Sara’s mother to visit her. How true the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:16-40:21:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 21:16</a>: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise”!</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There was great rejoicing among Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Slovakia </em></strong>on March 24, 1993, when the religious association of Jehovah’s Witnesses was legally registered, thus officially ending a ban that had been imposed over 43 years ago. This was followed, on September 1, by similar action in the <strong><em>Czech Republic.</em></strong> There are many people in these lands who are disillusioned with religion and with politics. Some of them are searching for the truth. This was true of an elderly couple in Bobron na Orave, Slovakia. The woman had questioned the priest about the Bible, but he had replied: “Hanka, choose some better book for reading.” Yet, she and her husband persisted in reading the Bible. They were making changes in their lives in harmony with what they were learning. To satisfy their spiritual hunger, they had subscribed for a number of religious magazines. Now they agreed to study the Bible with the Witnesses. As the woman later said, right from the beginning of her conversation with the pioneers she felt that God himself had sent them.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><span id="page52" class="pageNum" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span><strong>Middle and South America</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“Look! My own servants will cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:14-23:65:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 65:14</a>) This good spiritual condition of heart is evident among Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico. In spite of concerted opposition by the Catholic Church, on May 7, 1993, the government of <strong><em>Mexico </em></strong>registered our two religious associations: <em>La Torre del Vigía, A.R., </em>and <em>Los Testigos de Jehová en México, A.R. </em>As of that date Jehovah’s Witnesses became an officially recognized religion. They now look forward to putting up signs, for the first time publicly identifying their Kingdom Halls.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This past year, 445 new congregations were formed. Publishers totaled 375,351 in June. The number attending the Memorial was 1,349,998. As the publishers increase, the territory is worked more frequently. In one well-worked territory, two sisters called at a home where the exasperated householder exclaimed: “I have already told you that I do not want you coming to my house with your message. Why can’t you pay attention?” One of the sisters replied: “Well, <span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>we are many preachers. No doubt you told some of our companions. However, we can make arrangements so that no one will call on you. Please give us your name and complete address and we will pass this information to all the Witnesses in this area and then no one will call on you again.” At this the householder said: “No, you don’t have to go to that extreme. You can still call on me, but not so often, please.” Shortly thereafter the sisters encountered the same woman at the Kingdom Hall. What had happened? When another publisher had called, she had agreed to study the Bible!</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Although <strong><em>French Guiana </em></strong>has the smallest population of the countries in South America, spiritual interests are thriving there. In April, the branch reported its 21st consecutive peak in publishers, and they are averaging 14.5 hours per publisher in the field service each month. In that land, too, ‘the little one has become a thousand,’ and they are happy to be part of the “mighty nation” that is praising Jehovah worldwide.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The contrast between Witnesses and others attracts lovers of righteousness. An elderly sister in Caracas, <strong><em>Venezuela, </em></strong>went to the bank to get some money. Without counting it, she put it into her purse. But on arriving at home, she found that the teller had given her 1,200 bolívares (US $13) too much. She called the bank and said to the teller that if, at the end of the day, he discovered that some money was missing, he should let her know. At 5:00 p.m. he came to the sister’s home and said that he was missing 1,200 bolívares. When the sister handed him the money, he exclaimed: “This is the first time anyone has ever done this! I could have lost my job.” The sister used the opportunity then and on future visits to the bank to give a witness. Soon a Bible study was started with that young man, and he is attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><span id="page54" class="pageNum" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>As they witness, pioneers in <strong><em>Chile </em></strong>are well aware that Jehovah is directing the work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9</a>) A couple in southern Chile were ready to head home after a nine-hour day in remote territory. On the main road, the last bus to Antuco passed them by. They were tired and hungry, and a 24-mile <strong>[40 km] </strong>uphill walk lay before them. It was getting dark and cold. Other vehicles, too, passed as if the couple did not exist. As they walked, they wondered what Jehovah had in mind for them. Then, without any signal from them, a bus going in the opposite direction stopped for them; so they climbed aboard. When they reached a town and got off, they remembered a couple they had met some months ago. Might they know of someone who had a vehicle and who would take them to Antuco? The man of the house had a better idea: “Why not stay overnight with us?”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">When the pioneers accepted, the lady of the house was delighted and exclaimed: ‘Now we will have you all to ourselves to answer our questions!’ And ask questions they did​—about Jehovah, the anointed ones, the faithful slave, the great crowd, the wild beast, and so forth! The couple had obtained the <em>Live Forever </em>book and studied it until they knew much of it by memory. Oh, how they had prayed that someone would help them to understand more! “And here you are!” After a long and satisfying conversation, the hospitable family served them a delicious meal and then showed them a comfortable bed. How grateful those pioneers were that Jehovah had used them in this way!</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">At times, it is not refutation but kindness that penetrates the hard exterior of opposers. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:15-20:25:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:15</a> states, “a mild tongue itself can break a bone.” Brumilda Castillo, a Witness who is an ex-nun, called on a devoutly Catholic family in <strong><em>Ecuador. </em></strong>When the wife saw the Witness, she hurled verbal abuse at her. Our sister did not try to refute the charges; she simply smiled, thanked the woman, and said that surely she would be able to speak to her at another time. <span id="page55" class="pageNum" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>As our sister was leaving, she met the husband, who not only responded as his wife had but also ordered Sister Castillo to get off his property. Again she smiled, thanked him, and said that she hoped to talk to him at another time. When husband and wife discussed what had occurred, they were perplexed. How could she smile and thank them when they had been so rude to her? They were so impressed, that the husband invited in the next Witness who called. The Witness invited them to a meeting, and they came. Who should be the first to greet them? The sister they had treated so badly. They apologized profusely to her, and she took advantage of the opportunity to start visiting them.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">One day the man wanted to know what she thought of a chapel he had built on his property and filled with images. She asked if he would get angry with her if she told him the truth. “Of course not,” he replied. “Will you do what the Bible says you should do?” she asked. “I’ll do it this very day,” he promised. So she proceeded to show him what his Catholic Bible said about the use of images. At that, he said: “I want you to help me get rid of all these images.” It took four days to clean them all out and burn them.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">All who become servants of Jehovah need to put on the new personality. With some people, however, the task may seem impossible. In northeastern <strong><em>Brazil </em></strong>a young man who agreed to study the Bible had a very bad reputation. His family said that almost daily someone came to their home to collect debts he had incurred when drinking. His parents constantly feared that he would be killed. Everyone told the pioneers who were conducting the study: “You are wasting your time with him. He’ll never change.” But “the word of God is alive and exerts power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) When the man gave up drinking and immorality, the whole town was impressed. His parents exclaimed: “Peace has come again to our home!” Because of the changes that he made, three others in his family are also studying and attending meetings.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><span id="page56" class="pageNum" data-no="56" data-before-text="56"></span><strong>North America and the Caribbean Islands</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">On more than one occasion, Jesus emphasized the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself. There are many ways in which such love can be shown. A sister in <strong><em>Martinique </em></strong>writes: ‘One morning when driving to work, I offered a ride to a young woman who did not look well. On the way to town, I spoke to her about God’s purpose and the blessings of the new world. She said that her mother was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but that her own life was filled with hardship and she did not believe that God could do anything to better her condition. I proposed that she study the Bible with me for one month, and she accepted. After the month, I asked whether she wanted to continue. “As never before,” she said.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">‘Her family situation was bad. Later, when her husband, who had another woman, ordered her out of the house, I helped her and her children. In time, she left Martinique for France, where she had been offered employment.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">‘Some time later, her husband came to my door. At first I was fearful. But he had been deeply impressed by the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>change in his wife and by my own conduct. He had come to ask for a Bible study.’</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">A pioneer sister who is also a schoolteacher in <strong><em>Jamaica </em></strong>says that by taking an interest in people and being kind to them, she is also often able to help them spiritually. She observed that some students in the institution where she was employed were having difficulty with a particular subject, so she kindly gave them extra assistance. To help them to appreciate the value of education, she also used material from the <em>Young People Ask </em>book. What she was doing changed the attitude of those who observed. As a result, she was able to start four Bible studies and place a considerable quantity of literature.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">A recently acquired airplane, better suited to our work than what we had before, is being used by the <strong><em>Alaska </em></strong>branch to speed up the work of witnessing in isolated villages. The tempo of this activity is about twice what it was in years past.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">When calling at a home in the <strong><em>Dominican Republic, </em></strong>two publishers caught sight of a couple inside who were kneeling in prayer. They waited until the couple had finished praying, then knocked again. When the people came to the door, the publishers were greeted with the words: “Thank you, God, for listening to our prayer.” They eagerly accepted the offer of help in studying the Bible. Two days later, when scriptures condemning the use of idols were discussed, they promptly excused themselves and gathered up all the images in their home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:25-5:7:25" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 7:25</a>) Turning to his wife, the man asked: “Are we with Jehovah or with the Devil?” “Jehovah,” she responded. With that, they burned up all the images​—and they had many. Spiritually speaking, the fields are white for harvesting in the Dominican Republic, and in recent years the local Witnesses have been glad to welcome upwards of 150 other Witnesses who have come from abroad to help with the ingathering.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="ss"><span id="page58" class="pageNum" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span><strong>Islands of the Pacific</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">March 1, 1993, was an important day for our brothers in the <strong><em>Philippines. </em></strong>On that day the Supreme Court unanimously reversed a decision made by that court in 1959. It upheld the right of Jehovah’s Witnesses “to refuse to salute the Philippine flag on account of their religious beliefs.” Thus students were not to be barred from schools, public or private, because they refrained, for religious reasons, from saluting the flag, singing the national anthem, and reciting a prescribed patriotic pledge.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">A sister on the island of <strong><em>Guam </em></strong>who works secularly full-time wanted to expand her ministry. She longed to share the joy being had by publishers who related experiences about fruitful Bible studies. Many times she prayed to Jehovah about it. As she examined her circumstances, she came to realize that there might be a potential for Bible studies right where she worked every day. After asking Jehovah for courage and support, she began talking to her fellow workers. At first it was difficult; those who showed <span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>interest were ridiculed by the others. In order to reach various ones with the good news, she prepared well, and she found prayer to be an important part of her preparation. When worldly celebrations came up, she explained the Scriptural basis for her refraining from participation. She looked for literature that would be particularly appropriate to each person. In one case, she simply read her Bible quietly where a workmate could see her. Sure enough, the young woman became curious, and a study was started. Slowly she began to develop progressive Bible studies. When transferred to another department, new opportunities opened up. One student introduced her to a dear friend who also showed interest and who, in turn, spoke to her mother, brother, and sister-in-law. All of them studied regularly. So many showed interest that our sister had to ask other publishers to help her care for them. Yes, our sister has learned that positive results and much joy can come from informal witnessing.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">When in a cemetery, a teenage publisher in <strong><em>Australia </em></strong>observed a Filipino woman weeping at a grave. He engaged her in conversation and pointed to the inscription on his grandfather’s gravestone: “Sleeping awaiting a resurrection.” This opened the way for a further witness. Arrangements were made to meet her at the same location the following week, but she failed to arrive. The young publisher persisted. He and his mother searched through funeral notices in the local newspaper until they found a name that seemed to be Filipino. With the help of the telephone book, they made contact. The woman explained that she had missed the appointment because of transport problems. But she definitely was interested, and arrangements were made for a Bible study. Concern for people along with persistence brings good results.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="ss"><span id="page60" class="pageNum" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span><strong>Lands Where Conditions Have Become More Favorable</strong></p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">During the past five years, amazing changes have taken place. In at least 35 lands, obstacles have been cleared out of the way for freer proclamation of the Kingdom message. In many of these countries, bans have been lifted or the religious association of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been legally registered. What a vast field this has opened up! What is being done to cultivate it?</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Twelve missionaries have been sent to <strong><em>Estonia,</em></strong> also 20 special pioneers from Finland. At least 200 other publishers have moved to Estonia to serve in territories where the need is greater. The brothers report: “The population of Estonia is very eager to discuss the Bible. Almost everyone welcomes the message.”</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">In Maardu, Estonia, the brothers were given property free on which to build their Kingdom Hall, but certain conditions were set out by the mayor: (1) They must trim the small park next to the hall; (2) the Kingdom Hall must be completed <span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>by October 15, 1993; (3) meetings must be open to all the inhabitants of the town; and (4) the Witnesses must tell the inhabitants of Maardu the Bible’s message and teach them the right way to live. The brothers were more than happy to agree to all four requests of the mayor!</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">Since the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Cape Verde Republic </em></strong>was legally registered in 1991, ten missionaries have been assigned to this territory. What sort of results are they having? One missionary couple report that they are conducting studies with 70 persons, some of whom began conducting studies with others after only two or three months. An isolated group of six publishers rejoiced when 150 turned out for a talk by the circuit overseer. And national television covered the building of the first Kingdom Hall in this country.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">On January 8, 1993, the Supreme Court in <strong><em>Zaire </em></strong>declared the ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses to be illegal. This year, 75,944 publishers shared in the field ministry there. They conducted 163,454 home Bible studies. Further, 310,088 were in attendance at the Memorial.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">More than 25 years ago, the Cambodian government refused to renew visas for George and Carolyn Crawford, so they had to leave that missionary assignment. During most of the time since then, there have been no Witnesses in <strong><em>Cambodia. </em></strong>However, last year Brother Crawford was kindly received by the director at the Cambodian Ministry of Religion. The director wanted to know how the Cambodian people would benefit if our missionaries were again allowed in the country. Other religious groups promised material benefits. But Brother Crawford explained that Jehovah’s Witnesses teach people to live by Bible laws and principles and that this yields spiritual, moral, and practical benefits, also how those who do this become better citizens. The minister was pleased. Approval was given for two missionaries <span id="page62" class="pageNum" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>to enter the country right away, with more to follow. On January 20, 1993, a letter was received in which the Watch Tower Society was granted permission to open an office in the capital city, Phnom Penh, for the preaching of the “Jehovah” Christian religion.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">After a 40-year ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Romania, </em></strong>they were granted legal recognition in 1990. They have made good use of their changed circumstances. There was a 15-percent increase in Kingdom proclaimers this past year. Already, 130 Kingdom Halls have been constructed or are under construction. Some publishers are taking the initiative to reach out to areas where there were no Witnesses. In September 1991, two pioneer sisters moved to the small city of Urziceni, 35 miles <strong>[57 km] </strong>from Bucharest. At that time there were no Witnesses in this city; now 10 are baptized, and 66 attended the Memorial. Who conducts the meetings? At first, the sisters organized and conducted them. Now a ministerial servant, a brother nearly 80 years of age, travels a distance of 18 miles <strong>[30 km]</strong>, three times a week, to conduct the meetings. Once a month, elders from Bucharest give a public talk and conduct the <em>Watchtower </em>Study for the group.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">Even in some lands where Jehovah’s Witnesses are still under ban, they are able to carry on their ministry with less hindrance. In one of these countries, the publishers are now working their territory more thoroughly, calling at every home instead of skipping about in order to avoid being detected. In one town, the authorities stopped a group of publishers, examined their identification papers, and questioned them. The brothers explained that they were students of the Bible and that they wanted to share with others what they were learning. The authorities apologized for having bothered them and let them go. It was a joyful day of theocratic service.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb"><span id="page63" class="pageNum" data-no="63" data-before-text="63"></span>In another land where Jehovah’s Witnesses were cruelly mistreated, they have recently been meeting and preaching more openly. This is <strong><em>Malawi. </em></strong>Formerly, when they had a small assembly, they would put up a grass fence around the house so that light from the lamps would not show outside. But in one circuit they realized that local officials who were aware of their meetings were no longer taking action against them; so, at the time of a recent assembly, they built no fence, and they even sang songs. In another area, when a brother was preaching in the market, a local official who saw him said: “Do not be afraid of us anymore. We want you to preach, and even we should be one of you.” In yet another area, a man who, like Saul of Tarsus, was a leader of those who persecuted the Witnesses accepted a Bible study. Soon others joined in, and the number of those studying rose to 26. After the first man got baptized, the number studying as a result of his changed course rose to 66. Then, at last, on August 12, 1993, the 26-year-long ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Malawi was lifted. What a cause for rejoicing!</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Developments in <strong><em>Albania </em></strong>have truly been encouraging. In late October, 16 special pioneers from Italy and 4 from Greece were sent to Albania. After one week in Albania, though they were just beginning to learn the language, they had started 90 Bible studies! In Gjirokastër, a radio announcer was so impressed by what he was learning from one of the special pioneers that he announced over the air: “Jehovah’s Witnesses will be calling at your home. They will discuss how to keep a happy family life and teach you what the Bible says. Open your doors. Listen to them.”</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">Since the ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Benin </em></strong>was lifted in 1990, throngs of people have flocked to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This past year, 15,951 attended the Memorial​—nearly five times the number of publishers. One congregation with 37 publishers had 698 in attendance!</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb"><span id="page64" class="pageNum" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>In 1992, the final steps were taken toward granting legal recognition to Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Togo, </em></strong>thus marking the end of a ban that had been imposed in 1978. Thousands of people were eager to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. In 1993, the 7,125 publishers conducted 19,014 home Bible studies. In Lomé, the capital, there are 4,200 publishers, in 33 congregations, meeting in six Kingdom Halls. They urgently need more places in which to meet. Even though there was political turbulence, during which some 300,000 refugees fled from Lomé to nearby countries, the Governing Body arranged for a new branch office to go into operation there on June 1, 1993. How encouraging this was to the brothers in Togo!</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">In February 1993, the 23-year ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in <strong><em>Cameroon </em></strong>was lifted. When commenting on the government’s decision, one Cameroon newspaper wrote regarding Jehovah’s people: “Socially, they display behavior that has nothing in common with the hypocrisy of those around them, . . . they preach by example.” The paper added that, with freedom of worship granted to the Witnesses, “all the old churches of Christendom face a formidable challenge.” Despite the long ban, there are 19,268 Witnesses in Cameroon, and 67,671 attended the Memorial there this past year.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">What about countries that were within the <strong><em>former Soviet Union? </em></strong>As noted earlier, some of the most exciting conventions in 1993 were held in that part of the world. In 12 of those lands, during the past year our brothers devoted a total of 14,180,165 hours to the work of Kingdom proclamation, 14,973 new disciples were baptized, and at the time of the Memorial, 256,242 gathered to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. Yes, it is evident that these lands, too, will be well represented in that ‘great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues’ that will survive the coming great tribulation with the prospect of eternal life in Jehovah’s righteous new world.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

We Will Study the Revelation Climax Book Again
1 The title page of the Revelation Climax book quotes Revelation 1:3: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy.” The happiness of Jehovah’s people today has certainly been enhanced in great measure by the modern-day fulfillments of the prophecies contained in the Bible book of Revelation. Our present-day understanding of happenings in this, “the Lord’s day,” is set out in Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! (Rev. 1:10) Through a study of it, we have gained insight into significant world events, especially those that involve the world empire of false religion and the onward march of nations to Armageddon as well as Jehovah’s dealings with his people.
2 For many of us, a study of this publication will not only refresh our minds on points previously considered but also sharpen our spiritual view of current developments leading up to Jehovah’s day of triumph over all his enemies. The thousands who have joined our ranks during the past two to three years will certainly benefit from this third consideration of the Revelation Climax book in the Congregation Book Study.
3 Be sure to prepare well, to be present, and to participate in a meaningful way each week, starting October 3, 1994. You will be richly rewarded and blessed as you discern more clearly the meaning of unfolding world events in the light of prophecy recorded in the book of Revelation. Surely, we need to consider seriously such material, since it is even more timely now than ever before. May we enjoy the promised happiness as we read, listen to, and meditate on this thrilling prophecy about our times!

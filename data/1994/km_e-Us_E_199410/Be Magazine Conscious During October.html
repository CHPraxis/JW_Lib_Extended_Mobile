<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup><em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>contain the comforting and encouraging message of everlasting good news. Being magazine conscious involves taking time to read them carefully and to consider how the articles may appeal to people in our territory.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>First, become familiar with the articles highlighted on the cover. The cover illustrations themselves will often place the magazines. Pick out articles that you feel may appeal to the people in your territory. Are the people primarily of one religious faith? What are their major concerns? With these thoughts in mind, you should be able to prepare an effective presentation. Note those set out below.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you are offering the October 1 “Watchtower,” you might feature the article “The Bible​—What Is Its Real Value?” You could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “You can find a Bible in virtually every home in our community. Many who have one feel that it contains something of special value.” Then you might ask a direct question, such as: “What do you think makes the Bible unique?” or, “What do you think will help more people benefit from the Bible?” Following the householder’s response, you may be able to continue with appropriate remarks, such as: “There is overwhelming evidence to prove that the Bible is inspired by God and is a reliable guide for us. It contains knowledge that can lead us to everlasting life. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.] Many people respect it but do not know how to use it. This article in <em>The Watchtower </em>explains how you personally can use the Bible to obtain answers to your questions about the future. I would like to leave this copy with you. If you enjoy it, the next time I call I will let you know how you can have <em>The Watchtower </em>sent to your home on a regular basis.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Using the October 15 “Watchtower,” you may prefer a simple approach like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “Almost everyone has lost a loved one in death. This article raises the question, ‘What Is the Condition of the Dead?’ What do you think happens when a person dies? [Allow for response.] If you would like to know how the Bible answers that question, I would be pleased to leave this copy of the magazine with you.” Have the tract <em>What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </em>ready to offer if the householder prefers more concise material.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>The October 22 “Awake!” examines another one of the many evidences showing the failure of false religion. Using the articles on “When Religion Takes Sides in War,” you could pose this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “If Jesus were here today, how do you think he would feel about all the violence around us? [Allow for response.] Jesus taught us to love everyone, even our enemies. Yet, many religions claiming to be Christian take sides in political conflicts. How do you think that affects people who want to live by what Jesus taught? [Allow for response.] This issue of <em>Awake! </em>discusses that question and explains how God’s Kingdom will provide the answer.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Make it a point to offer the magazines at every door, even if you are unable to discuss the Bible. Most people who accept the magazines are pleased to make a small contribution toward our worldwide Bible educational work.</p>

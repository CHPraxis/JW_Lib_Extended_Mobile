Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1995
INSTRUCTIONS
During 1995 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom [jv], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived [gt], “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the New World Translation [*td], and United in Worship of the Only True God [uw] will be the basis for assignments.
The school will begin with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This talk should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” When based on the Proclaimers book, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the “All Scripture” book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used. Illustrations, photographs, and charts found in the Proclaimers book may be commented on by the speaker and used as teaching aids. All are encouraged to make careful advance preparation so as to benefit fully from this material.
The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested in advance by the speaker.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer or by another elder or ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. Limit the overall review of the assigned chapters to 30 to 60 seconds. The principal objective is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should actually be read without a break. Of course, where the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.
TALK NO. 3: 5 minutes. This talk will be assigned to sisters. The subjects for this talk will be based on the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived or “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the New World Translation. The student assigned should be able to read. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Sisters assigned this talk will need to adapt the theme and the material to be considered to a practical setting, preferably one that involves field service or informal witnessing. Not the setting but the effective use of the material should be given prime consideration.
TALK NO. 4: 5 minutes. Assigned to a brother or a sister. It will be based on United in Worship of the Only True God. When assigned to a brother, this should be a talk to the entire audience. It will usually be best for the brother to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. When assigned to a sister, the material should be presented as outlined for Talk No. 3.
COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student talk, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student speaker merits solely a “G” and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G,” “I,” or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student’s next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those giving talks should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows after the giving of necessary oral counsel, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should be careful to use no more than a total of two minutes for counsel and any other brief remarks after each student talk. If the Bible highlights presentation left something to be desired, private counsel may be given.
PREPARING TALKS: Before preparing an assigned talk, the student should read carefully the School Guidebook material dealing with the speech quality to be worked on. Students assigned the second talk may choose a theme appropriate to the portion of the Bible that is to be read. Other talks will be developed in line with the theme shown on the printed schedule.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime, nor should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Talks No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The one assigned to give the stop signal should do so promptly. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.
WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material, and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper. The school overseer will consider with the audience the answers to the review questions and concentrate on the more difficult ones, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be given a week later than what is shown on the schedule.
LARGE CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 50 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Of course, unbaptized persons whose lives conform to Christian principles may also enroll in the school and receive assignments.
ABSENTEES: All in the congregation can show appreciation for this school by endeavoring to be present at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. It is hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.

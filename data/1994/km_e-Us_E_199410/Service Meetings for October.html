<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Do You Have a Standing Order? The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are tremendous aids in spreading the Kingdom message. We should offer them at every opportunity. The March 1984 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>recommended that each publisher have “a definite <em>magazine order </em>. . . for a set number of copies of each issue.” Otherwise we may find that we have no current issues to offer and have to rely on tracts or brochures. Good for each family member to have a standing order. Place orders at magazine counter. Be sure to pick magazines up each week. Tactfully inform householder that we accept a modest contribution for our worldwide work; make sure it is placed in the appropriate box at the Kingdom Hall. Mention benefits that come from having a standing order.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Offer the <em>New World Translation </em>in November. Since most people already have a Bible, we need to show why the <em>New World Translation </em>is superior. Refer to the book <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1101990135/4-10"><em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” </em>(pages 327-8, pars. 1-6)</a>. Explain why Jehovah’s name is used, and give some examples showing the advantages of using modern language. Point out helpful features in the back of the Bible, such as “Bible Words Indexed,” which can be used to locate familiar texts quickly. The “Table of the Books of the Bible” shows who wrote each book and where and when it was written, as well as the time period covered. Refer to <em>Reasoning </em>book (page 59, subheading “Bible prophecy explains the meaning of world conditions”), and discuss how you might start a Scriptural conversation based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 29</a>.

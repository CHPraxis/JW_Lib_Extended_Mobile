<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When directed by Jehovah’s angel to an Ethiopian who showed sincere interest in God’s Word of truth, the disciple Philip lovingly offered to help him understand what he was reading. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-39</a>) Do we go out of our way to help those who show interest? We should, since our divine commission includes the making of disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) What can we do to help them?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Set aside time each week for making return visits. Arrange to call on those who showed interest, and try to resume the Scriptural discussion started on your initial visit. Have in mind the goal of starting a Bible study. Return regularly to offer the latest issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>When genuine interest is found, you may offer subscriptions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you discussed the value of the Bible on your initial call, you might resume the conversation, using a suggestion from </em></strong><a class="xt" data-xtid="171" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989213/47:350-52:528"><strong><em>page 66 of the “Reasoning”</em></strong></a> <strong><em>book and say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “Some feel that the Bible’s advice is not practical in our modern world. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] Wouldn’t you agree that a book providing sound counsel that can enable us to have a happy family life is practical? [Allow for comment.] Theories and practices involving family life have changed, and the results that we see today are not good. But families that apply what the Bible says are basically stable and happy.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:18-51:3:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 3:18-21</a>. Offer the tract <em>Why You Can Trust the Bible, </em>and explain that we offer a free Bible study program.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You could initiate a discussion about the condition of the dead in this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “There has been much talk about the condition of the dead. What do you think happens to us when we die? [Allow for response.] Most religions teach that we continue to exist in some other form. Many have been surprised to learn what the Bible says about this matter. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>.] While the dead have no conscious existence, they have not been forgotten. God has promised to bring them back to life under the rule of his Kingdom.” Turn to the October 15, 1994, <em>Watchtower </em>or to <a class="xt" data-xtid="172" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989109/34-39">page 162 in the <em>Live Forever</em></a> book, and discuss the scriptures and illustrations. Arrange for another return visit, with a view to starting a Bible study.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “Some believe that fighting is the only way to settle disputes. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows that God wants people to live together in peace. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 12:17, 18</a>.] That will become a reality worldwide under the rule of God’s Kingdom.” Refer to the brochure <a class="xt" data-xtid="173" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992009/17:523-27:285"><em>Does God Really Care About Us?, </em>pages 25-6</a>.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The Ethiopian eunuch acknowledged his inability to understand without someone to guide him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:31-44:8:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 8:31</a>) Philip lovingly gave him the help he needed. We can show our genuine love for others by helping them in the same way.</p>

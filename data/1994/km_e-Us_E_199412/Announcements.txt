Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1982 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have the older books in stock will offer True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth will be featured. Placements of this book should be followed up with return visits, and efforts should be made to start Bible studies. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14). The pre-1982 publications mentioned above are not available in Brooklyn.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The Memorial for 1996 will be Tuesday, April 2, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1996 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.
▪ Large-print editions of the semimonthly Watchtower in Hungarian and Romanian became available with the September 1, 1994, issue. Audiocassette editions of the semimonthly Watchtower in Italian also became available on that date.
▪ Distributors’ copies of The Watchtower in Marshallese, Palauan, Ponapean, Trukese, and Yapese are now available and may be requested from the Society.
▪ The Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, and Nepali editions of The Watchtower will change from monthly to semimonthly beginning January 1, 1995.
▪ Estonian and Papiamento have been added to the languages in which Awake! is available. These are quarterly editions and begin with the January-March 1995 issue. Distributor copies may be requested through the congregation.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1994 on their December literature request. The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.​—See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 24, 25.
▪ Beginning with the 1995 district conventions and the September 1995 circuit assemblies and special assembly days, there will be no food served. Each one is to bring his own food and drink. Complete details will be provided in a later issue of Our Kingdom Ministry.
▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.
▪ The Society has prepared legal forms that can provide us with added protection regarding our stand on blood. These forms also address other health-care matters, such as end-of-life decisions. Thus they work together with the Advance Medical Directive/​Release in making your health-care wishes known. Publishers are not obliged to prepare these forms. Those interested in doing so (for example, those contemplating surgery or those who want to make other health-care wishes known in advance) may obtain from the congregation secretary the form for their state of residence. He will also provide a question-and-answer folder that fully explains the purpose and use of the form.

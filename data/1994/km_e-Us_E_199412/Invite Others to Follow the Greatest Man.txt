Invite Others to Follow the Greatest Man
1 As recorded at Matthew 5:14, Jesus told his disciples: “You are the light of the world.” Followers of Jesus were to tell people everywhere about Jehovah’s Kingdom and His loving provision for salvation through Jesus. With that commission in mind, during the month of December we look forward to offering the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. Here are some suggestions you may want to use.
2 After introducing yourself, you might put the following in your own words:
▪ “Many have wondered what Jesus was like when he lived as a man on this earth. In what ways do you think he was different from others? [Allow for reply.] This fascinating book, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, relates the highlights of his life and ministry, and it provides insight into the kind of man he was. After reading it, some feel as though they have had an opportunity to associate with him personally, share his sufferings, and observe his ministry firsthand.” Point to the first illustration in the book, which features the title. Then turn to the introduction, and read the second paragraph under the subheading “Benefit by Learning About Him.” If there is good response, offer the book.
3 Or you might say something like this:
▪ “During this season people are thinking about Jesus. However, because so many bad things are happening all over the world, some may wonder if Jesus really cares about us. How do you feel about that?” Allow for a reply. Turn to chapter 24 of the Greatest Man book, and discuss briefly why Jesus came to earth. Then read John 15:13, emphasizing Jesus’ heartfelt love for others. Remember to have the latest magazines, a brochure, or an appropriate tract available to offer if the book is not accepted.
4 Here is another suggestion:
▪ “Most young people are looking for role models to imitate, but good ones are hard to find. Jesus Christ set the perfect example for everyone. [Read 1 Peter 2:21.] His whole life was centered on the worship of his heavenly Father. What do you think it would be like if more people tried to imitate him?” Allow for a reply. Refer to the third paragraph on the next to the last page of the book, which describes his special qualities. Explain how the Greatest Man book can help all of us to become better Christians.
5 You might want to use something like this:
▪ “When someone mentions Jesus Christ, many people think of him either as a baby or as a suffering man about to die. Their concept of Jesus involves only his birth and his death. The marvelous things he said and did during his lifetime often go unnoticed. What he accomplished affects every person who has ever lived on this earth. That’s why it’s vital that we learn as much as we can about the wonderful things he did in our behalf.” Read John 17:3. Turn to the first page of the introduction of the Greatest Man book, and read the fourth paragraph. Explain how the book can be obtained and used for personal study.
6 Be sure to keep a record of interest and placements so that you can follow up by making return visits. While there is yet time, let us zealously seek out honesthearted people and help them to become followers of our Savior, Jesus Christ.​—Matt. 16:24.

Urge Them to Become His Followers
1 At 1 Corinthians 3:6, Paul wrote: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” Paul used this reasoning to help his brothers see the need for working unitedly under the headship of Christ. In this way he also helped them appreciate the vital role they played in the important planting and watering work.
2 That lifesaving work is to be brought to a conclusion in this very day. As dedicated Christians, we share the serious responsibility to help others become Jesus’ followers. (Acts 13:48) How will you follow up on the interest you were able to stimulate by using the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived?
3 If you are returning to visit a person who accepted the book, you could say:
▪ “When we last spoke, we discussed what Jesus Christ was like as a man. I was pleased to leave you the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. What has impressed you most about Jesus’ teaching and about his personality?” Allow for response. Turn to chapter 113, and discuss Jesus’ superb example of humility. Read Philippians 2:8 to show how the apostle Paul viewed Jesus’ humble attitude. You could then explain how more can be learned through a regular study of the Bible.
4 You may prefer this introduction:
▪ “We talked about things Jesus did while on earth that show he truly cares about us. What do you think he will ultimately do to relieve those who have suffered so much?” Allow for response. Turn to chapter 133, and review the comments in the fifth paragraph. Turn to the picture on the next page, and explain what it will be like when God’s will is done on the earth as it is in heaven. Point out the benefits to be gained by learning more.
5 If there was insufficient interest to offer the book initially, perhaps you can start your discussion this way:
▪ “I think both of us agree that many people today pattern their life after someone they view as their role model. Jesus Christ is the best role model anyone could have. I would like to share with you a very important lesson that I learned by studying the example set by Jesus. [Turn to chapter 40 in the Greatest Man book, and call attention to Jesus’ kindly lesson on mercy.] This forcefully reminded me of how much I need to demonstrate this quality toward others.” Read Matthew 5:7. If there now seems to be greater interest, offer the book or the brochure Does God Really Care About Us?
6 Or you may want to try this direct approach:
▪ “The last time I was here, we discussed the importance of gaining knowledge about Jesus. John 17:3 says that it ‘means everlasting life’ to take in such knowledge. How can we do that?” Allow for response. Continue by explaining our Bible study arrangement and how to take advantage of it.
7 Paul says that a worker in the harvest “will receive his own reward according to his own labor.” (1 Cor. 3:8) If we exert ourselves vigorously in helping others become Jesus’ followers, our reward is sure to be great.

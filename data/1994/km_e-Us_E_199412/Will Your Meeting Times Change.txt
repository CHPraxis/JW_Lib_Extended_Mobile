Will Your Meeting Times Change?
In cases where several congregations using the same Kingdom Hall have agreed to rotate or adjust meeting times, this should be done the first of January. A willingness to cooperate with the arrangement that has been established demonstrates mutual love and consideration. Often the change in meeting times will be to your personal advantage, making meeting attendance more convenient.
On the other hand, the change taking place this year may not fit in well with your schedule of activity. It could require adjustments in your normal routine that may be somewhat unsettling. Each one’s willingness to cooperate demonstrates an appreciation for the overall arrangement, which works out for the mutual benefit of everybody involved.
Of course, the next rotation of meeting times may be more to your liking. In the meantime, you are encouraged to make the necessary personal adjustments so you can attend all weekly meetings according to the schedule that has been decided upon by the congregation. Strive to maintain the view of the psalmist David, who declared: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’”​—Ps. 122:1.

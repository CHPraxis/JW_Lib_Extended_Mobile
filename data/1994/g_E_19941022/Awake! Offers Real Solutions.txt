Awake! Offers Real Solutions
That is what a reader in Vinton, Iowa, U.S.A., likes about Awake! Opening with the salutation “Dear Editor,” she said:
“I am writing to express my appreciation for the timely articles in Awake! magazine. I am impressed with each issue I receive and am constantly reminded of the superior quality of the articles in this magazine.
“Many magazines are very disheartening to read or look over, simply because there is so much bad news in the world today. On the other hand, while Awake! always deals with subjects of current interest and importance to us all, the approach is unique. Readers can always be certain to find that Awake! offers the hope of a real and lasting solution to universal problems by encouraging trust in the Bible’s promises and directing attention to the Bible as the authority, and not in differing or subjective opinions of humans.
“Over the years I have truly enjoyed reading Awake! The most worthwhile reading for all of us is that which gives an honest approach to improving life while maintaining a positive outlook on the future. Thank you for helping your readers to see what is important.”

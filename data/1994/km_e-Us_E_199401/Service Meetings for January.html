At some “Divine Teaching” District Conventions, <em>more than 50 percent </em>of the cards used to obtain a new release were unsigned, not witnessed, or out-of-date.

Anyone missing that book study can still be assisted by conductors/​elders at the next Service Meeting until all baptized publishers have their cards properly filled out and signed.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>Any 192-page book printed on paper that yellows or discolors or any published prior to 1980. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em><strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines, as well as any brochure (except the <em>School </em>brochure). Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Older publications for January campaign are not available in Brooklyn, but congregations should use those they already have in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Saturday, March 26, after sundown. While it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested persons find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or for a general interchange of encouragement among all present. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should determine what arrangements will best help all who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 6, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Human Creation’s Groaning​—When Will It End?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 1994 Memorial season will be given worldwide on Sunday, April 10. The subject of the talk will be “True Religion Meets the Needs of Human Society.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 10.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ According to new tax laws in the United States, beginning in 1994 anyone making a contribution of cash or other property in an amount of $250 or more on a specific date to the Society, a congregation, an Assembly Hall, or a circuit must have written substantiation of the gift. The person making the gift must receive the letter of substantiation before he can claim a deduction on his tax return. Canceled checks for contributions of $250 or more on a single date are no longer considered proof of the donation by tax authorities. The substantiation must also indicate whether the donor received any goods or services in connection with his contribution. Bodies of elders, Assembly Hall Committees, and circuit assembly overseers have been instructed to supply a letter acknowledging all such contributions to those who request substantiation.</p>

Treasure in the Garbage
That is what a person in Hungary felt he had found. He wrote to Jehovah’s Witnesses and explained:
“I would like to make a request of your organization. I would like to order from you The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom and the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.
“Let me explain the reason for my request. In my city I work with a garbage truck where I found the magazine. I cleaned it and took it home with me. At home I studied it with my family. We would like to increase our little knowledge. Therefore, we ask you for your understanding and help.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are pleased to respond to such requests for Bible literature and for help to come to a better knowledge of the Bible. Therefore, if you would like to have a copy of The Watchtower or would like someone to call at your home and consider with you the Bible-​based hope presented in the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

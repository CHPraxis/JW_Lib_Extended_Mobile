<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Breast Cancer  </strong>Thank you very much for publishing the series “Breast Cancer​—Every Woman’s Fear.” (April 8, 1994) I have checked myself from time to time and have simply thought that my glands were hard. Feeling very uncertain, I did nothing about it. However, after reading the article, I went to the hospital and learned I had cancer. Arrangements were made for me to have an operation. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since my surgery, I haven’t been able to read anything about cancer. So when the magazine came out, I wasn’t thrilled about it. But I usually read all issues of <em>Awake! </em>from cover to cover, and that night I decided to read a little and stop if I got scared. Well, I couldn’t stop reading it. It was so well-​done, so informative, and so caring.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The article helped me see how Jehovah understands our fears of facing a life-​threatening illness. I had always thought people were weak or lacked faith if they felt this way. It really helped me to see the deep compassion Jehovah has.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If ever a magazine spoke to someone, that issue surely spoke to me. My husband and I sat on the couch with our medical bills for my breast-​cancer surgery spread all around us. As we wrote check after check, the mailman delivered this issue of <em>Awake! </em>I read the article that very day, with more than ordinary interest. Thank you on behalf of all the women who will draw courage from the articles.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Cities  </strong>I am 16 years old and was thrilled to read the series on cities. In geography class we were asked to give a short talk on the subject of our choice. I based mine on the article “The City That Was Abundant With People.” (January 22, 1994) After I read my talk out loud in class, everyone applauded. Thanks for helping me to improve my understanding of geography.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sj">T. R., Germany</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In the article “Let Us Build Ourselves a City,” you said: “In 1900, London was the only city in all the world with a population of one million.” (January 8, 1994) But in the following issue, you said: “By the mid-1800’s it [Edo, now called Tokyo] had a population well in excess of a million people.” Which is correct?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sj">S. T., Japan</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>The statement regarding London was apparently in error. It was based on the 1985 edition of the “Illustrated Atlas of the World” </em>(<em>Rand McNally and Company</em>). <em>However, “The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1993” appears to be correct in saying that several cities had populations of over a million as of 1900. Sorry for the confusion.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>The Money Chase  </strong>As a young reader of <em>Awake!, </em>I was really touched by the series “The Money Chase​—Where Will It End?” (March 22, 1994) It seems to me that my peers have only one goal: to fill their wallets. However, to follow what Jehovah teaches is much more honorable than to worship things that are perishable.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Sports  </strong>Thanks for the item “Does God Take Sides in Sports?” (February 8, 1994) I have made the mistake of praying for victory in a track race; I’ve also prayed for the defeat of my competitors. Now I know that Jehovah’s will is not connected with sports. I am dedicating my life to Jehovah, and I feel more comfortable knowing that he is really listening to my prayers.</p>

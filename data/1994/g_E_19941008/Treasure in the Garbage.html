<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a person in Hungary felt he had found. He wrote to Jehovah’s Witnesses and explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I would like to make a request of your organization. I would like to order from you <em>The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom </em>and the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Let me explain the reason for my request. In my city I work with a garbage truck where I found the magazine. I cleaned it and took it home with me. At home I studied it with my family. We would like to increase our little knowledge. Therefore, we ask you for your understanding and help.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are pleased to respond to such requests for Bible literature and for help to come to a better knowledge of the Bible. Therefore, if you would like to have a copy of <em>The Watchtower </em>or would like someone to call at your home and consider with you the Bible-​based hope presented in the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth, </em>please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

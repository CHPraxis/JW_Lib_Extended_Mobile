<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is what a person from New Zealand said regarding <em>The Watchtower, </em>the magazine you are reading. Concerning an article about the celestial chariot of God that is described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 1</a>, the person wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Each of these four living creatures, or cherubs, had four wings and four faces. They had a lion’s face, denoting Jehovah’s justice; a bull’s face, representing God’s power; an eagle’s face, signifying his wisdom; and a man’s face, designating Jehovah’s love.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“After reading this over and over again, I had a warm feeling inside my heart. Tears came to my eyes, those of joy. My immediate thoughts were, ‘How beautiful and pleasant you must be, Jehovah!’ I am quite stunned at myself for these new feelings toward this Jehovah God whom I have mocked for many years, being the worldly person that I am. I say ‘thank you’ to Jehovah’s Witnesses, and to the many like me, I say, ‘Let’s read more before we mock.’”</p>

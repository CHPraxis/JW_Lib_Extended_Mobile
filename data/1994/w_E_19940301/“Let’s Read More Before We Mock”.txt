“Let’s Read More Before We Mock”
THAT is what a person from New Zealand said regarding The Watchtower, the magazine you are reading. Concerning an article about the celestial chariot of God that is described in Ezekiel chapter 1, the person wrote:
“Each of these four living creatures, or cherubs, had four wings and four faces. They had a lion’s face, denoting Jehovah’s justice; a bull’s face, representing God’s power; an eagle’s face, signifying his wisdom; and a man’s face, designating Jehovah’s love.
“After reading this over and over again, I had a warm feeling inside my heart. Tears came to my eyes, those of joy. My immediate thoughts were, ‘How beautiful and pleasant you must be, Jehovah!’ I am quite stunned at myself for these new feelings toward this Jehovah God whom I have mocked for many years, being the worldly person that I am. I say ‘thank you’ to Jehovah’s Witnesses, and to the many like me, I say, ‘Let’s read more before we mock.’”

A Modern-​Day Good Samaritan
A WOMAN in Canada suffered an automobile accident. A modern-​day Good Samaritan came to her aid. (Luke 10:29-37) Moved by his kindness, she wrote the following to The Georgetown Independent:
‘Dear Editor:
‘I am writing for two reasons. First, I wish to thank a Georgetown resident who assisted me this past weekend after I lost control of my car and crashed into a ditch.
‘Mr. John Saunders was driving by and stopped. He started first aid and was very reassuring. He stayed with me until the ambulance drivers and police took over. Your community is blessed in having a Good Samaritan like Mr. Saunders living in your community.
‘Mr. Saunders came to visit my husband and me in the hospital, just to make sure I was all right. I was shocked to find out that Mr. Saunders works at the head office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Georgetown. I always thought that those people did not believe in medicine, and here one of them had used first aid medical training in my behalf. This brings me to the second reason for writing.
‘I would like to apologize to all of Jehovah’s Witnesses for the rudeness that I have shown them when they have called at my door. I have always believed that you are fanatics. Mr. Saunders proved this terrible assumption wrong. You are all just normal people trying to do what you feel is right.
‘Thank you again, Mr. Saunders, and keep the faith. God bless you.
‘T. M., Toronto’

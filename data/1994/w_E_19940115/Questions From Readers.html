<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Since the Bible often mentions “the fatherless boy,” does this indicate less concern for girls?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Definitely not.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>uses the phrase “the fatherless boy” in many verses that manifest God’s concern for children who lack a parent. God made this concern clear in the laws he gave to Israel.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For example, God stated: “You people must not afflict any widow or fatherless boy. If you should afflict him at all, then if he cries out to me at all, I shall unfailingly hear his outcry; and my anger will indeed blaze, and I shall certainly kill you with the sword, and your wives must become widows and your sons fatherless boys.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:22-2:22:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 22:22-24</a>) “Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty and fear-inspiring, who treats none with partiality nor accepts a bribe, executing judgment for the fatherless boy and the widow.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:17-5:10:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:29-5:14:29" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:17-5:24:17" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 24:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:19-5:27:19" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 27:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many Bible versions read “fatherless child” or “orphan” in these verses, thus covering boys and girls. However, such renderings ignore a flavor found in the underlying Hebrew word (<em>ya·thohmʹ</em>), which is in the masculine gender. Instead, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>uses the accurate rendering “fatherless boy(s),” as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:5-19:68:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 68:5</a>, which reads: “A father of fatherless boys and a judge of widows is God in his holy dwelling.” Based on the same sensitivity to the underlying Hebrew, the feminine gender of a verb in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:11-19:68:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11</a> recommends the reading: “The <em>women telling the good news </em>are a large army.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Even though “fatherless boy” is the principal rendering of <em>ya·thohmʹ, </em>this should not be taken as suggesting an absence of concern for girls who lack a parent. The passages quoted and others show that God’s people were encouraged to care for females, for widows. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:9-19:146:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 146:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:17-23:1:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isaiah 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:22:3-24:22:3" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 22:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:9-38:7:10" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Zechariah 7:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:5-39:3:5" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Malachi 3:5</a>) In the Law, God also included an account about a judicial decision that guaranteed an inheritance for the fatherless daughters of Zelophehad. That ruling became a statute for handling similar situations, thus upholding the rights of fatherless girls.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:1-4:27:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Numbers 27:1-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus did not discriminate by gender in showing kindness to children. Instead, we read: “People began bringing him young children for him to touch these; but the disciples reprimanded them. At seeing this Jesus was indignant and said to them: ‘Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to suchlike ones. Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.’ And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:13-41:10:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 10:13-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Greek word here rendered “young children” is in the neuter gender. A noted Greek lexicon says that this word is “used of boys and girls.” Jesus was reflecting a corresponding interest by Jehovah in all children, boys and girls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:3-58:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:3</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:14-5:16:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:35-41:5:35" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Mark 5:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:38-41:5:42" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 38-42</a>.) It should thus be recognized that counsel in the Hebrew Scriptures about caring for “fatherless boys” amounts to advice on how we should be concerned about all children who lack a parent or parents.</p>

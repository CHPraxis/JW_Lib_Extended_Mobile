Like Apples of Gold
APPLES​—how they delight both the eye and the palate! The Bible uses this delicious fruit in a thought-provoking simile when it says: “As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it.” (Proverbs 25:11) What is meant by this statement?
“Apples of gold in silver carvings” may denote carved work, such as an engraved silver tray with fruit of gold on it. Since earlier verses in this chapter mention approach to a king Pr 25:2, 3, 5, 6, this verse could refer to presents given to a ruler​—golden ornaments in the shape of apples placed on silver trays. (Proverbs 25:6, 7) Impressively beautiful, indeed!
There is similar beauty in appropriate, dignified, timely words, whether written or spoken. They are delightful, encouraging, and beneficial in many ways. Especially are the divinely inspired contents of the Bible like beautiful “apples of gold in silver carvings.”
As illustrated by King Solomon’s wise saying at Proverbs 25:11, he “sought to find the delightful words and the writing of correct words of truth.” (Ecclesiastes 12:10; Proverbs 25:1) Centuries later, the Christian apostle Paul wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.” (2 Timothy 3:16) Yes, the Bible contains beneficial counsel, prophecies, word pictures, and truths of such brilliance and beauty that they greatly surpass the works of the finest artisans. Moreover, anyone gaining wisdom from God’s Word, the Bible, acquires a priceless possession and can entertain the hope of eternal life.​—Proverbs 4:7-9; John 17:3.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Recently a man from Oklahoma, U.S.A., received a copy of <em>Awake! </em>magazine that featured the subject “Will All Races Ever Be United?” Addressing his letter “Dear Watchtower Publishers,” the person wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Just now I had the good fortune to read your August 22, 1993, issue of <em>Awake! </em>dealing with the problem of race relations. I was astonished, and impressed, at your fair-​minded, insightful understanding of this complex problem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I recently concluded a college course on U.S. history. But in just 9 pages of your magazine you gave a concise history, explanation, <em>AND REMEDY </em>of this insidious problem that surpasses a full semester of college text and lectures. The articles were so balanced it’s impossible to tell the racial background of the writers.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“As the world becomes more polarized along ethnic lines, everyone needs to be exposed to this kind of information, as much as you can get out. Thank you for having the courage to publish truth and common sense.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If you would like a copy of <em>Awake! </em>mailed to your home, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

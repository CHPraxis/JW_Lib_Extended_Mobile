“I Am Wonderfully Made”
“WHERE did I come from?” This is a question most young children ask at one time or another. When the children grow up, their question often becomes more profound: “Where did life come from?” This question has been discussed for thousands of years, and currently many scientists view evolution as the most reasonable answer to the puzzle of the origin of life. Basically, the evolutionist’s explanation is that life arose by chance.
About 3,000 years ago, King David wrote: “In a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:14) The more we learn about life, the more truth we see in those words. Indeed, physicist Fred Hoyle wrote: “As biochemists discover more and more about the awesome complexity of life, it is apparent that the chances of it originating by accident are so minute that they can be completely ruled out. Life cannot have arisen by chance.”
So what is the origin of life? The two opening articles of this magazine discuss that question. If you would like to have further information, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 2.

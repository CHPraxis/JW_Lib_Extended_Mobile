“Undoing the Past”
“We know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.” That was true when these words were written nearly 2,000 years ago, and it is true today. But can history, with all its human suffering, be undone?​—Romans 8:22.
THE 32-​page full-​color brochure entitled Does God Really Care About Us? discusses this very matter. “God will compensate us for the suffering we may have endured in this world,” it says. “With great compassion God will more than make up for the bad past that was inflicted upon us.”
The publication brings together convincing evidence that a bright future awaits us. After reading this brochure, a 20-​year-​old Canadian wrote: “I cannot express in words how much this publication touched my heart! It truly is a precious jewel. It reminds us of the wonderful hope that God has in store for us. I feel that the section on ‘Undoing the Past’ was lovingly written. Thank you for reminding us of how much Jehovah loves us.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Faithful Youths  </strong>I was touched by the series “Youths Who Put God First.” (May 22, 1994) When I was a teenager, I had a brain tumor. As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I told the doctors: “I don’t want to take a blood transfusion.” Although a court order was obtained to force blood on me, the surgery went well without it. As I read about these faithful young servants of God, I had tears in my eyes. They had been through the same experience as I! Their stories have touched my heart and strengthened my love for God.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I am 17 years old and have been afraid of finding myself in such a situation one day. Dying doesn’t scare me, but the thought of disregarding Jehovah’s laws does. It would be awful to give in under pressure. The article gave me much strength.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When I read the articles, I could not hold back the tears. Afterward, I read very carefully the booklet <em>How Can Blood Save Your Life? </em>(published by the Watchtower Society). I now know how to behave should I ever be in a similar situation.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Since I suffer from an incurable form of leukemia, the experiences of young ones who have proved their devotion to Jehovah were quite encouraging to me as an adult. Many thanks.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I am 18 years old. I was thrilled and shaken when I read the articles yesterday. I could not stop crying when I came to see that these faithful children died. Their faith has made me ask myself whether I could, under such conditions, keep my integrity.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I was really struck by the indomitable firmness of all the youths mentioned. After reading the articles, I cried a lot and thanked Jehovah that he gave them the strength to face such difficulties down to their death. I can sincerely say that my teenage problems are really nothing in comparison.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sj">R. C., Italy</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">There is no question that these deeply moving articles will encourage all young people who read them. These young ones were all firm in their refusal of blood; at the same time, they could think for themselves and explain themselves clearly. I was encouraged to learn that whatever pressures and tests there are, Jehovah will not fail to give us strength and needed help.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Illiteracy  </strong>I appreciated the series “Breaking the Chains of Illiteracy.” (February 22, 1994) When I fled from China to South Africa in the 1950’s, I was unable to speak any of the languages spoken here. However, Jehovah’s Witnesses patiently helped me to understand the Bible in English. I also attended their meetings, including the Theocratic Ministry School. My English gradually improved, and now I am confident in the door-​to-​door ministry.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Reincarnation  </strong>Although I am Muslim, I am a regular reader of <em>Awake! </em>I wish to express my sincere thanks for your recent series “Have You Lived Before? Will You Live Again?” (June 8, 1994) I found it very informative. I have for a long time been searching for information that could be used to correct some of my friends who insist upon the existence of reincarnation. With the information given, I believe they will surely agree that since there is a resurrection, there cannot be reincarnation.</p>

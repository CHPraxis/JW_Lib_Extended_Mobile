<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Fads​—Should I Jump on the Bandwagon?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘THAT’S really cool!’ ‘Now that’s hot!’ Compliments may fly when your peers see you are following the latest fad. Yes, fads have a way of grabbing attention and evoking strong reactions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Fads also change like the weather, however, and are notoriously short-​lived. According to one marketing survey, a fad first gains a toehold among small groups of daring, unconventional youths. As it begins to spread, manufacturers and advertisers promote it by means of magazine, TV, and radio ads. Musicians and celebrities are paid to give it respectability and prestige by endorsing it. Youths themselves may promote it with missionary zeal. If it catches on, it can become the rage among “the overwhelming majority of the teen population.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Eventually, though, a fad loses steam and passes into oblivion. (<em>American Demographics</em>) But while a new style, dance, or gadget is the rage, you may feel under intense pressure to conform. Many feel like 15-​year-​old Kim: “You are made to feel like an outcast when you are different.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jumping on the bandwagon can be a costly enterprise. Take, for example, the pin fad that broke out among French youths a few years ago. According to a 1991 article in <em>The New York Times, </em>“it is de rigueur [a must] to have your baseball cap or jacket lapels loaded with colorful, domino-​dot-​size enamel tack pins.” The fad seemed harmless enough​—but you had to be able to pay a whopping $12 for each designer pin.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A youth may also find that being “cool” means more than simply laying out cash. In some quarters where it is fashionable to wear a baseball cap, you have to pick a cap with the right color, representing the right team, and part of the fad is the way you wear the cap.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">To many youths this is serious business. They see following certain fads as the key to gaining prestige or acceptance. Even so, we will see that jumping on the bandwagon is not always the smart thing to do.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Considering Your Steps</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Bible does not categorically condemn fads per se. Some popular activities may be appropriate despite their faddish nature. Jogging, for example, was considered a fad by some when it became popular a few years ago. But who can deny the benefits of <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>wholesome, moderate exercise?​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Nevertheless, some fads range from silly to downright dangerous. The warning of an ancient proverb is thus appropriate: “Anyone inexperienced puts faith in every word, but the shrewd one considers his steps.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) A shrewd person is wise, discerning. He doesn’t blindly follow some new trend simply because it is popular. Wisely, he weighs the consequences of his actions.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Cost may be one factor to consider. A Canadian magazine tells of a teenage girl who works in a fast-​food restaurant. More than half of her hard-​earned cash goes to keeping up with the latest clothing fads. “Money is for a protection,” says the Bible, that is, it’s a needed, useful tool. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>) Can you afford to squander it on items that are, as one writer puts it, “designed to become obsolete within a season or two”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Physical danger may be another factor to ponder. Break dancing was popular not too long ago. But it produced a crop of back injuries. What about today? An article in <em>Rolling Stone </em>magazine talks about the wild antics at dance clubs and rock concerts, such as “stage-​diving” (leaping from the stage into the arms of cheering fans), “slamming,” and “moshing”​—“dance” activities that are little more than violence set to the beat of music. “This thing has gotten <em>way </em>out of hand. I mean, <em>really,” </em>complains one youth. She describes how frenzied “moshers” will “commandeer the dance floor and let it rip, undulating in an ever-​widening whirlpool, mindlessly bashing into anyone who has the misfortune of standing in the vicinity.” Such behavior may impress some of your peers. But will being in such places or doing such things gain the favor of God, who commands Christians to “repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Titus 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">What about the health dangers of body piercing and tattooing​—also gaining in popularity among youths? Doctors say that tattooing can pose medical risks, such as hepatitis and perhaps AIDS, if sanitary measures are not taken. Then there is the prospect of being permanently decorated long after the fad has passed out of style. True, some tattoos can be zapped away by a laser. But laser treatment involves several painful sessions, costing hundreds of dollars each.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>Most deadly of all is the spiritual damage that can result from following certain fads. Many of them center on celebrities​—actors, athletes, musicians, and the like. It becomes “cool” to dress and act like whoever is currently in the limelight. But how does Jehovah God view such hero worship? As a form of idolatry. The Bible thus warns: “Flee from idolatry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>) Many celebrities have no regard whatsoever for the Bible’s moral standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>) Such being the case, could God possibly be pleased if you act or dress in ways that, in effect, pay homage to such ones?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>The Impression You Give Others</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The Bible also commands youths to honor their parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:2-49:6:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:2</a>) Would it not dishonor them if you came home festooned with body jewelry or covered with tattoos? And what about others, such as your classmates? If you are a Christian, would they find it hard to take you seriously if you later tried to share your faith with them?​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The same might be said about wearing some of the styles made popular by rap artists. Granted, in many localities a baseball cap is just a head covering. But in some urban neighborhoods, “politics now play a key role in the popularity of certain hats.” (<em>Entertainment Weekly</em>) Could wearing certain caps, jackets, sneakers, or other hip-​hop paraphernalia give the impression that you adhere to the rap life-​style? Remember, Christian love “does not behave indecently” or in a shocking manner.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Consider what happened to one group of teenage girls in a conservative town who, according to <em>People </em>magazine, flouted local sensitivities by going to school clad in “hip-​hop style wardrobes.” Explained one girl: “We see these clothes on MTV [a cable TV station featuring music videos]. I thought they looked good.” However, the trendy garb ignited controversy​—and racial violence.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As Christians we therefore want to ‘adorn ourselves with modesty and soundness of mind.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9</a>) This involves considering the feelings and attitudes of others and not insisting on one’s personal preference. It also means avoiding styles of dress and behavior that others may view as extreme.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>The Need for Caution</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Of course, each fad must be weighed on its own merits. Remember, though, that Satan the Devil is the ruler of this world and his goal is to “devour someone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) No doubt some popular fads have been used by Satan to distract and lead youths away from God. Caution is thus in order.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It usually isn’t wise to be among the first to follow any new trend or fad; it’s a lot safer to lean toward being conservative. On the other hand, the Bible also cautions against being “righteous overmuch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:16-21:7:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>) Surely you do not have to resist changes of style to the point of looking hopelessly out-​of-​date, weird, or eccentric.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">When a fad clearly violates Bible principles or good sense, then the smart thing to do is to steer clear of it. Granted, it is not easy to be different from your peers. But in her book <em>How to Say No and Keep Your Friends, </em>writer Sharon Scott asks: “Do you have any friends so brilliant and who know you so well that <em>they </em>should be making your decisions for <em>you? </em>Probably not!” Would it not be better to be guided by your parents’ wishes and by your Bible-​trained conscience? Doing so may not bring you the approval of all your peers, but it will bring Jehovah’s approval, which, unlike some fleeting fad, can be everlasting!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:12-19:41:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 41:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:2-20:12:2" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Proverbs 12:2</a>.</p>

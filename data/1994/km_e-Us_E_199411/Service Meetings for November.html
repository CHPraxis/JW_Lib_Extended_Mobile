The <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1101991135/"><em>Greatest Man </em>book, chapter 133</a>, states: “Our hearts are moved when we consider his sublime courage and manliness, his unparalleled wisdom, his superb ability as a teacher, his fearless leadership, and his tender compassion and empathy.” The Bible clearly identifies him as (1) a Witness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>), (2) a Savior (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 4:12</a>), and (3) a King (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15</a>). Have a capable publisher demonstrate a presentation using some of these points. Encourage all to share in distributing this book during December.</p>

Help Them to Hear “Even Another Time”
1 “We will hear you about this even another time.” (Acts 17:32) That was the response of some to Paul’s famous discourse on Mars’ Hill. Likewise today, some are willing to hear more about the Kingdom message that we shared with them on our initial visit.
2 We do most of our teaching when we return to cultivate the interest. Good preparation will help us get positive results. Page 51 of the School Guidebook recommends: “First get the arguments supporting the material clearly in mind. Try to determine why a thing is so. See if you can put the ideas in your own words. Get a good understanding of the Scriptural proofs. Be prepared to apply the scriptures effectively.”
3 If you placed the book “The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?,” you might say something like this:
▪ “When we spoke previously, we discussed reasons why we can have confidence in the Bible. The book I left with you raises the question, ‘Why Read the Bible?’ [Read introduction on page 5, and allow for a response to the concluding question.] The Bible tells us that very soon God himself will solve all mankind’s perplexing problems, and it guides us in the way we must go to enjoy the blessings of that happy time. [Read Psalm 119:105.] This book is designed as an aid to personal and family study of the Bible. I would be pleased to show you how to use it.”
4 On calls where you left the tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible,” you could say this:
▪ “All of us are interested in what the future holds. In view of present world conditions, what do you think will happen? [Allow for response.] While man can only speculate about what will happen, God knows exactly what will take place. [Read Isaiah 46:10.] It may surprise you to learn that the Bible predicts that we will soon enjoy the blessings of a paradise new world. [Read the third paragraph on page 4.] Let me tell you more about this wonderful promise.”
5 If you are following up the placement of the “New World Translation,” perhaps this suggestion would work for you:
▪ “Recently, I left a copy of the Bible with you, and I promised to return to help you make the best use of it. At times we may wonder how we can maintain friendly relations with others. The Bible has good advice to offer, and the New World Translation makes it easy to find what we need. [Turn to page 1595 and look under the heading “Love(s).” Call attention to such texts as 1 Corinthians 13:4; Colossians 3:14; and 1 Peter 4:8. Briefly explain how applying these principles can produce fine results.] This is one example showing how the Bible offers practical solutions to our problems. Next time, I’d like to show you another way the Bible can help us find happiness and peace of mind.”
6 There is no greater treasure that we can pass on to others than an accurate knowledge of God’s Word. Such knowledge can teach the fear of Jehovah and encourage people to walk in his way, which brings everlasting blessings.​—Prov. 2:20, 21.

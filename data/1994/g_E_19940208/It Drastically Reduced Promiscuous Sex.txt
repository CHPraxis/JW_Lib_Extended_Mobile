It Drastically Reduced Promiscuous Sex
A counselor at a university in Oklahoma, U.S.A., reported that the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work has done the above. The counselor at Langston University wrote:
“I would advise any person that’s dealing with young people between the ages of 13-18 to use this particular book. It explains sex in a way that our students should know about in order to cope with the problems of today’s complex society. From my own experience, I found that it helps them to be knowledgeable of what happens if they are promiscuous. It acquaints them with the various sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, venereal disease, herpes and gonorrhea.
“If you do decide to have sex, it points out how you should choose just one partner for life, and upholds the sanctity of marriage. I have really enjoyed using this book. It has an effect on the lives of those who use it. I noted that the number of young ladies in our program getting pregnant was drastically reduced after it was introduced.”

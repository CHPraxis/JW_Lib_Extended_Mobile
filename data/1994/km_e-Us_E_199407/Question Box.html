<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ What should the secretary do when a regular pioneer moves into the congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The secretary should notify the Society, using the space provided on the back of the Congregation Report (S-1). He should also promptly contact the secretary of the pioneer’s former congregation and request all the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards (S-21) on file as well as a letter of introduction from the Congregation Service Committee.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When a pioneer makes a major move, he often has some difficulties in getting settled and establishing a good routine for service. A pioneer appreciates it very much when elders offer loving assistance to him so that his transition to the new congregation is as smooth as possible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Reminder: The secretary provides replacement Pioneer Service Identification cards (S-202) <em>only </em>for pioneers who move to the congregation from within the contiguous United States. Pioneers who lose their card, who change their name because of marriage or divorce, or who move from areas served by another branch (including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico) should receive their new card from the Society, <em>not the secretary. </em>The secretary or the pioneer should write the Society, explain the situation, and request a new card.</p>

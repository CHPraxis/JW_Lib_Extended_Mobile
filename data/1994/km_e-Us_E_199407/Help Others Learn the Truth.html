<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus came to earth to bear witness to the truth. To get the truth preached to others, he trained his disciples to be teachers. He was so confident of their success in teaching others that he called them ‘public instructors.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:52-40:13:52" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 13:52</a>) He likened each one to a learned man having a veritable treasure store from which to draw. Jesus’ disciples today use the printed page to speed up the Kingdom-preaching work. For example, many congregations have a variety of booklets to use in helping others become disciples. How can these valuable instruments be used?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>To start a conversation leading into offering the booklet “A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It,” you might ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Have you ever wondered why it is that in spite of all man’s efforts, prospects for a secure future seem quite dim? [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why so many efforts have failed.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a>. After reasoning with the householder on information in paragraph 6, you could ask: “Who is really able to provide us with long-term security?” Depending on the householder’s response, you may decide to discuss appropriate points from paragraph 7 or arrange to do that at a future time.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Here is one way you may be able to use the booklet “Is There a God Who Cares?”:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Many people have asked the question that appears in the caption below these two illustrations. [Read the question at the bottom of pages 6 and 7, and allow for response.] Since a loving God would not promote both good and bad at the same time, what do you think of his promise recorded here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-24</a>?” If you get a comment that shows a measure of interest, turn to paragraph 37, and explain what will be accomplished by God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When offering the booklet “There Is Much More to Life!,” you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “For many the quality of life has been reduced to dreary, monotonous drudgery. What do you think is needed to make life more meaningful? [Let householder express his opinion.] The Bible shows that God has better things in store for us. See what he says here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4, 5</a>.” If appropriate, continue the discussion with points from paragraph 42 of the booklet.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Using the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!,” a younger publisher might ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Would you like to live in a paradise earth like this? [Show the front and back cover, and allow for a comment.] My family and I look forward to living there because of what the Bible says here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.” If interest is observed after reading the scripture, offer to leave the brochure for the person to read.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>If you are using other booklets or brochures in your ministry this month, you may pattern your introductions and presentations on the foregoing suggestions. Remember to be brief and to make positive and upbuilding comments to arouse the interest of householders.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jehovah has given us the truth. We should seize the opportunities set before us to share it with others, both in printed form and in our conversations with the people we meet. In this way we prove ourselves to be public instructors for the lasting benefit of others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“How . . . will they hear without someone to preach?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 10:14</a>) Indeed, how will they grasp the meaning of the truth unless we make effective return visits? Any call where we were able to converse with the householder about the Kingdom message merits a return visit. This month we may be able to follow up our initial conversation with additional Scriptural thoughts from whichever booklet we placed, and that may lead successfully into a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If you placed the booklet “A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It,” you may be able to initiate a conversation that would lead into a Bible study this way. Pointing to the front cover, you could ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Would you like to live in a world where a secure future is guaranteed for you and your family? [Allow for a response. Then turn to paragraph 2.] All of us share this desire, although many doubt that it will ever be possible. For God, who promises to make this a reality, it is not impossible.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:17-23:32:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:17, 18</a> as it is quoted in paragraph 2, or read it from your Bible. Continue, explaining that there are people around the world who are already experiencing the joy and peace of mind that come with a sure hope for the future. Discuss Scriptural thoughts in paragraph 3, and then explain how a study of the booklet can help the householder learn more. If the person is interested, make arrangements for an early return visit to continue the discussion.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When you return after placing the booklet “Is There a God Who Cares?,” perhaps something like this will be effective:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “On my previous visit, we discussed the question, Is there a God who cares? Do you think God cares enough about us to bring an end to suffering and violence? [After the person responds, turn to paragraph 32, and continue.] God has promised to replace this wicked world with a new one inhabited by good people who will be able to live in peace. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>.] You and I can also enjoy life in that new world if we believe the Bible and apply its counsel.” Explain our program for helping people study the Bible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When you make a return visit after placing the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” you might start by showing the picture on the cover and then asking the question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “What do you think it would be like to live in a perfect world? [Get householder’s comments.] What you see in this picture is not just a figment of the imagination; it is based on sure promises stated in the Bible. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 29</a>.] I would like to explain how you and your family can enjoy this blessing.” If the householder manifests interest, continue the discussion, and offer a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>When we find sincere people who are searching for the truth, we demonstrate our genuine love by returning to help them act on what they have heard. We use the sacred truths entrusted to us for the everlasting blessing of ourselves and those who listen.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July: A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternative offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. August: Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, and What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It? September: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Subscriptions may be offered on return visits. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.
▪ New Audiocassettes Available:
Danish: Doing God’s Will With Zeal (Drama; single audiocassette). English: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived (set of eight audiocassettes in an album).

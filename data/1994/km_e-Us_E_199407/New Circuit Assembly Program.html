<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The theme that will be developed in the new circuit assembly program to begin in September is “Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty.” It is based on the apostle Paul’s words of encouragement to first-century Christians recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:13-46:16:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The program will begin by highlighting our constant need for spiritual self-examination. Maintaining a strong stand for what is right in these “last days” calls for a realistic evaluation of our relationship with Jehovah and our standing with his earthly organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) We will be reminded of God’s appreciation for all our hard work. We need to be instructed in ways to improve our Christian qualities and maintain exemplary conduct.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The need to be zealous in the disciple-making work while reaching out for spiritual advancement and responsibility will also be emphasized. Practical suggestions on how individuals and families can maintain a regular spiritual feeding program will be featured in a variety of talks, demonstrations, and discussions.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>On Saturday qualified candidates will be able to make public declaration of their dedication by baptism in water. Then, on Sunday all of us will want to be present for the public talk, entitled “What Is Your Standing With God?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The program will conclude with encouragement to remain firm in faith, always dealing with one another in the spirit of love and peace. The circuit assembly is one of the special opportunities Jehovah provides for all of us to ‘incite one another to love and fine works.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) Make definite plans to be present for the entire program on both days.</p>

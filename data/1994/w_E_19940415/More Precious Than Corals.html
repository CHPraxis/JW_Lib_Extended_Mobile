<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Increasing numbers of visitors have thrilled over displays such as this in the waters of the Red Sea.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The countless fish in a rainbow of colors and hues are fascinating to those snorkeling in the clear waters. But observe that around the colorful fish seen here, there is an eye-catching display of other undersea wonders, including brilliantly colored corals.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The beautiful corals are to be found in many shapes and colors. As you can imagine, even in ancient times gorgeous pieces of coral were highly prized. From them artisans fashioned lovely ornaments, and Bible writers mentioned corals along with gold, silver, and rubies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:14-20:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:16-26:27:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 27:16</a>) But those writers help us to see beyond the beauty and value of corals themselves.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">They highlighted that some things are even more valuable and that we should treasure them more highly. A good, capable wife is one, for we read: “A capable wife who can find? Her value is far more than that of corals.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10</a>) Are you a married man? Look again at the exquisite corals here, and reflect on whether you are esteeming your wife as she merits.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Whether we are men or women, married or single, a view of splendid corals ought to help us appreciate the even greater worth of godly wisdom, discernment, and knowledge. God’s Word says: “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment, for having it as gain is better than having silver as gain and having it as produce than gold itself. It is more precious than corals, and all other delights of yours cannot be made equal to it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:13-20:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:11-20:8:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So whether seeing them by snorkeling ourselves or via photography, the corals of the Red Sea should convey to us both beauty and material for profitable reflection.</p>

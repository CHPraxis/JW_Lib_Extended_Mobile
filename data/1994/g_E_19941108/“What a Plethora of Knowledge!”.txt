“What a Plethora of Knowledge!”
“PLETHORA,” a word of ancient Latin and Greek origin, means “a superabundance, an excess.” A reader of the Watchtower and Awake! magazines in Sierra Leone, West Africa, wrote the above words regarding the yearly bound volumes of these magazines that are produced by the Watchtower Society. He continued: “What wonderful gems of priceless wisdom! There is hardly a subject that interests me that I do not find discussed somewhere in the pages of one of these volumes. Many times people honestly mistake me for a college graduate, and when I confess that I have never darkened the doors of a college, they are surprised. But I say: ‘No, I am only an avid reader of the Watchtower and Awake! journals.’”
These magazines appear each year in bound-​volume form. However, you can obtain the magazines through the mail. If you are interested, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, or write to the Watchtower Society at the nearest address indicated on page 5.

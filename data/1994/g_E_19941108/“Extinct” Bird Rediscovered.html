<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT is about the size of a domestic hen, has a red parrotlike beak and purple-​blue plumage, is flightless, and was considered extinct from about 1900 to 1948? Another clue: It is only found in New Zealand and has a Maori name. It is the takahe, or <em>Notornis mantelli hochstetteri.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These elusive birds spend most of the year in the highland of the Murchison and Kepler mountain ranges of Fiordland in the southwest of New Zealand’s South Island. However, a few are kept in captivity, such as the one photographed here in Te Anau’s small public park. <em>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Birds </em>states that this large bird (nearly 25 inches <strong>[63 cm] </strong>long) “has suffered a catastrophic decline in the face of competition and predation by introduced animals.” In spite of captive breeding and predator control, it is still an endangered species.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The same source says that “it feeds on the seed heads and tender bases of the grasses.” But it has to compete for its food “with [the] introduced deer and generally loses the contest.” Let us hope that this unique bird does not disappear from New Zealand’s list of singular creatures.</p>

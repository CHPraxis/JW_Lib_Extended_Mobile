<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mother in California, U.S.A., explained that it was what she had read in <em>The Watchtower </em>and its companion magazine, <em>Awake! </em>She wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My young son (age four) and I were abducted at gunpoint and forced to drive to my bank. The assailant robbed me, but I was able to grab my son and escape. What I feel really saved my son’s life, as well as my own, was the practical Bible suggestions printed in these most valuable magazines.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The mother added further explanation: “Earlier I had read in one of the <em>Awake! </em>magazines how to stay calm when faced with a dangerous situation like this. Immediately I prayed to Jehovah God to help me to be calm. I was also able to keep the assailant calm by quoting Bible texts to him.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The purpose of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>is to show that our troubled times were foretold in the Bible. They also provide help for people to cope with today’s stressful conditions. But the magazines do much more. They highlight the only permanent solution​—God’s Kingdom government for which Jesus Christ taught his followers to pray. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Surely you can benefit from reading regularly <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!</em></p>

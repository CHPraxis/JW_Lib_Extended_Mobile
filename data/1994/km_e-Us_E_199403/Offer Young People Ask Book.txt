Offer Young People Ask Book
1 Although the Revelation Climax book is being featured this month, you may decide to offer the Young People Ask book if you talk to a parent or a youth who is concerned about the problems that perplex young people.
2 You may find it appropriate to say something like this:
▪ “Growing up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations that require them to make weighty decisions. ‘Should I drink? Take drugs? What conduct is proper with the opposite sex?’ When young people ask about these basic issues, they are often barraged with conflicting answers. Where do you think many of them turn for advice? [Allow comments.] This book, Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, provides helpful information. [Direct attention to the table of contents, showing the variety of subjects covered.] Youths need answers that are straightforward and realistic. The answers in this book are backed by what the Bible has to say.”
3 Here is another presentation you might be able to use:
▪ “Young people are subjected to many pressures today. They need help to cope successfully. When we are trying the best we can to help them, don’t we look for something that provides practical guidance? [Allow for comment.] Some of the most intense pressures come from other youths, their peers. Notice the pictures on pages 76 and 77 in this book. [Direct attention to the captions for these pictures and to the italicized paragraphs on page 77.] The following pages in this chapter outline honest, workable answers.”
4 These certainly are “critical times hard to deal with,” especially for young people. (2 Tim. 3:1) The book Young People Ask can really help a young person to face today’s challenges successfully. The 39 chapters are richly illustrated, and the articles are realistic and practical. So whenever the occasion arises, be alert to use this fine publication.

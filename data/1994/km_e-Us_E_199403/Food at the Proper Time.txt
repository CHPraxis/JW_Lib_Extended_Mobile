Food at the Proper Time
As announced in the January 1994 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, the special public talk for the Memorial season this year will be presented in most congregations on April 10. The talk is entitled “True Religion Meets the Needs of Human Society.” A special effort should be made to invite those who attend the Memorial on March 26.

Question Box
▪ When should Congregation Book Studies be conducted?
It is usually more practical and convenient to have several book study groups meet in scattered locations throughout the congregation’s territory rather than have everyone meet at the Kingdom Hall. These studies should be conducted at the time most convenient for the majority assigned to attend. Usually, this is on an evening during the week when there are no other meetings or service activities arranged. However, it may be advantageous to arrange for a book study during the day to accommodate elderly ones who are hesitant about going out after dark and night workers. In a few cases, it may be practical to have a daytime study on the weekend.
The elders can make appropriate inquiries to determine the meeting times that will be “convenient for the majority of publishers” as well as interested ones. (om p. 62) The time selected should be on a day and at an hour that will not unduly interfere with or limit planned field service arrangements.

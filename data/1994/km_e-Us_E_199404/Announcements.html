Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. <strong>June: </strong><em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em><strong>July: </strong>A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.</p>

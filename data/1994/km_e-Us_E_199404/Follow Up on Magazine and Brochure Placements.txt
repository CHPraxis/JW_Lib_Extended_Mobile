Follow Up on Magazine and Brochure Placements
1 Jesus encouraged his followers to work at making disciples. (Matt. 28:19) That means more than just placing literature; we want to help people progress spiritually. To do that we must return to provide further assistance for those who manifest interest.
2 If you highlighted an article in one of the magazines on your first call, it would be good to discuss the same subject when you return:
▪ “When I visited previously, I called your attention to an article in The Watchtower (or Awake!) that helped us appreciate the need to look into the Bible. God’s purpose of a better future for mankind centers on his Kingdom government. Micah 4:3, 4 records his promise that this Kingdom will bring an end to all wars.” After reading the scripture, introduce the “Look!” brochure, and show the cover illustration. Consider the first paragraph and the scriptures cited for that paragraph, noting that Micah 4:3, 4 is one of them. Arrange for a return visit to continue the discussion with paragraph 2.
3 If the householder’s interest appears to be minimal or he does not have time to converse, you may decide simply to add his name to your magazine route:
▪ “Since you expressed interest in the magazines I left with you previously, I thought you’d enjoy the latest issues. I believe you’ll find this article particularly interesting.” Point out an article that you feel would appeal to him. (Many who have done this have found that people will readily offer a donation without our saying anything.) Offer to return with the next issues.
4 If the householder read the magazines and expresses appreciation for them, you may decide to offer a subscription:
▪ “Since you seem to enjoy The Watchtower, I’ve been pleased to deliver the latest issues as they come out. If you’d like, I can arrange for it to be sent to you regularly through the mail so that you’ll be sure to get every issue.” If he wants a subscription, you can add: “There’s no charge for our literature because our work is supported by voluntary contributions. If you’d like to make a small donation toward our work, I’d be happy to accept it.”
5 If you placed a brochure but did not have an opportunity to demonstrate the study arrangement, plan to do that on the return visit.
For example, if you left the “Government” brochure, ask the householder to get his copy, and say:
▪ “Notice what page 3 tells us about the theme of the message Jesus preached when he was on earth.” Then briefly discuss the information on page 3. Ask the householder what he thinks he needs to do to learn more. Then say: “It’s important that we appreciate why we need God’s Kingdom so much. I’d like to return and discuss why we must look to God’s government as our only hope.”
6 We have a variety of brochures. Locate interesting points in the one you plan to use. It will help you to encourage sincere ones to learn more about the things Jesus commanded.​—Matt. 28:20.

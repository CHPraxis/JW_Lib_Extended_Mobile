Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines, as well as any brochure (except the School brochure). Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. June: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? July: A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.
▪ A packet of legal materials is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters where our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in such a case if it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. Helpful information can be found for those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation litigation in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14, and the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.
▪ Where practical, elders should arrange for the congregation to share in evening witnessing as daylight hours increase.
▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 1994 in Chinese, English, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). It is necessary to request plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation who desire them.

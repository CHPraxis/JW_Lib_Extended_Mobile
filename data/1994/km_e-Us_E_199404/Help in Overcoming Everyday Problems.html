<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many expressed delight after receiving the book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It </em>at the “Divine Love” District Convention in 1980. Highlighting the practical value of this publication, one publisher stated: “It came at the right time because people today are not so much interested in doctrines as they are in knowing who created us, why we exist, and how everyday problems can be overcome.” Beginning May 9, 1994, once again the Congregation Book Study will study this fine publication. Prepare well, and attend regularly so that you too can find help in overcoming your everyday problems.</p>

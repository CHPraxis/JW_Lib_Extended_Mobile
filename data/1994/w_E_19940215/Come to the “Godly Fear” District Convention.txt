Come to the “Godly Fear” District Convention
JEHOVAH’S servants in ancient times were required under the Mosaic Law to come together three times each year for certain festivals. These were happy and spiritually upbuilding occasions.​—Deuteronomy 16:16.
In modern times Jehovah’s servants likewise come together three times each year: for the special assembly day, for the two-day circuit assembly, and for the three- or four-day district convention. During the 1994 service year, Jehovah’s Witnesses will come together for the “Godly Fear” District Convention.
God’s Word leaves no doubt about the importance of godly fear. That sort of fear is mentioned therein some 200 times. Godly fear is a protection, as can be seen from Proverbs 16:6: “In the fear of Jehovah one turns away from bad.” Why, we are told at Psalm 111:10 that godly fear is the very beginning of wisdom!
It might be said that there are two aspects of godly fear. For one thing, such fear is prompted by love. We fear to displease God because of our great love for him. (Proverbs 27:11) Then again, wisdom on our part will help instill godly fear in us, since we know that God is “also a consuming fire” to all who practice wrongdoing.​—Hebrews 12:29.
At our “Godly Fear” District Convention, we will receive much instruction and encouragement to grow in godly fear. Such teaching will be imparted by means of talks, demonstrations, and a drama, as well as the relating of experiences.
Even as the Israelites of old were commanded not to come to their assemblies empty-handed, so we should want to contribute our part to the joy and success of our conventions. (Deuteronomy 16:17) We can do this by manifesting respect for the table of Jehovah. How? By coming on time, by paying rapt attention to what is said from the platform, by entering wholeheartedly into the singing of songs. We would not be engaging in conversation or walking about during the program. We also will want to contribute to the extent we can by volunteering our services. Convention organization includes many departments, all of which require personnel to staff them. We will also want to make monetary contributions to the extent that Jehovah has blessed us.
Let each servant of Jehovah make plans now to be present for all three days of the “Godly Fear” District Convention, from the opening song on Friday morning to the closing prayer on Sunday afternoon.

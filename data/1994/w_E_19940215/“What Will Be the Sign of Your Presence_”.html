<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">MATTHEW 24:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 1, 2. What shows that people are interested in the future?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">MOST people are interested in the future. Are you? In his book <em>Future Shock, </em>Professor Alvin Toffler noted “the sudden proliferation of organizations devoted to the study of the future.” He added: ‘We have seen the creation of future-oriented think tanks; the appearance of futurist journals in England, France, Italy, Germany and the United States; the spread of university courses in forecasting.’ Toffler concluded: “Of course, no one can ‘know’ the future in any absolute sense.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The book <em>Signs of Things to Come </em>says: “Palmistry, crystal gazing, astrology, card reading, <em>I Ching </em>are all techniques of more or less complexity to give us some idea of what our particular future might hold.” But instead of turning to human methods, we do better to look to a proven source​—Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 3. Why is it fitting to look to God for knowledge of the future?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The true God stated: “Just as I have figured, so it must occur; and just as I have counseled, that is what will come true.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:24-23:14:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:27-23:14:27" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:9-23:42:9" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 42:9</a>) Yes, Jehovah has been able to counsel mankind about what <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>will happen, often doing so through human spokesmen. One of these prophets wrote: “Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:7-30:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Amos 3:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:20, 21</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus Christ was God’s foremost prophet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:1-58:1:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>) Let us focus on one of Jesus’ key prophecies that foretells things occurring around us now.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus proved that he was a prophet.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>You will find their question and Jesus’ reply in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:1-40:24:51" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:1-41:13:37" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Mark chapter 13</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:1-42:21:38" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke chapter 21</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> In many respects the accounts are complementary, but they are not identical.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 7. What did the apostles particularly ask about, but what was the scope of Jesus’ reply?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Just days before he was killed, Jesus declared that God had rejected Jerusalem, the Jews’ capital. The city and its grand temple would be destroyed. Some of the apostles then asked for a ‘sign of Jesus’ presence and <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>the conclusion of the system of things.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:24:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:37–24:3</a>) Undoubtedly they had in mind primarily the Jewish system and Jerusalem, for they did not grasp the scope of what lay ahead. But in answering them Jesus looked far beyond what occurred up to and including 70 C.E. when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:11-42:19:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:6-44:1:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Acts 1:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 8. What were some of the developments that Jesus foretold?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>As you can read in the three Gospel accounts, Jesus spoke of nation rising against nation and kingdom against kingdom, food shortages, earthquakes, fearful sights, and heavenly signs. In the years between Jesus’ giving of that sign (33 C.E.) and the desolation of Jerusalem (66-70 C.E.), false prophets and false Christs would arise. The Jews would persecute the Christians, who were preaching Jesus’ message.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 9. How did Jesus’ prophecy find fulfillment in the first century C.E.?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>These features of the sign actually occurred, even as historian Flavius Josephus confirms. He writes that before the Romans ever attacked, false Messiahs instigated rebellion. There were terrible earthquakes in Judea and elsewhere. Wars broke out in many parts of the Roman Empire. Were there major famines? Yes, indeed. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:30" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a>.) What of the Kingdom preaching work? By 60 or 61 C.E., when the book of Colossians was written, “the hope of that good news” of God’s Kingdom had been heard widely in Africa, Asia, and Europe.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 1:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>“THEN” the End</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">10. Why should we take note of the Greek word <em>toʹte, </em>and what is its significance?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In some respects Jesus presented events as occurring in sequence. He said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached . . . , and then the end will come.” Bibles in English frequently use “then” with the simple meaning of “therefore” or “but.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:15-41:4:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 4:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:17-41:4:17" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:23-41:13:23" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Mr 13:23</a>) However, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>, “then” is based on the Greek adverb <em>toʹte.</em><span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Greek experts explain that <em>toʹte </em>is a “demonstrative adverb of time” used “to introduce that which follows in time” or “to introduce a subsequent event.” Jesus thus predicted that there would be Kingdom preaching and then (‘after that’ or ‘subsequently’) “the end” would come. Which end?</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">11. How did Jesus focus on events directly linked to the destruction of Jerusalem?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>One fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy can be found in the events leading up to the end of the Jewish system. The wars, earthquakes, food shortages, and so on, that Jesus foretold occurred over a period of three decades. Yet, commencing with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 24:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:14-41:13:14" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Mark 13:14</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:20" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 21:20</a>, we read of events that were directly linked to imminent destruction, <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>when the end was at the doorstep.​—Note the single dotted line on the chart.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">12. How were the Roman armies involved in the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Matthew 24:15</a>?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Responding to a Jewish revolt in 66 C.E., Romans under Cestius Gallus marched against Jerusalem, surrounding this city that the Jews considered holy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:35-40:5:35" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 5:35</a>) Despite Jewish counterattacks, the Romans forced entry into the city. They thus began “standing in a holy place,” true to Jesus’ prediction at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:15 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:14-41:13:14" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Mark 13:14</a>. Then there was a surprising development. Though they had surrounded the city, the Romans suddenly withdrew. Christians immediately recognized the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy, and the withdrawal allowed them to flee from Judea into the mountains across the Jordan. History says they did so.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">13. Why were Christians able to heed Jesus’ warning to flee?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>But if the Romans withdrew from around Jerusalem, why did anyone need to flee? Jesus’ words showed that what had occurred proved ‘that the desolating of Jerusalem was near.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 21:20</a>) Yes, desolating. He foretold ‘a tribulation such as had not occurred from the beginning and would not occur again.’ About three and a half years later, in 70 C.E., Jerusalem actually did experience “great tribulation” from the Roman armies under General Titus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:19-41:13:19" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 13:19</a>) Why, though, would Jesus describe this as a tribulation greater than any before or since?</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">14. Why can we say that what happened to Jerusalem in 70 C.E. was “great tribulation” such as had not occurred before nor has happened since?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Jerusalem was ravaged by the Babylonians in 607 B.C.E., and the city has seen horrible fighting in our present century. Still, what occurred in 70 C.E. was uniquely a great tribulation. In a campaign of about five months, Titus’ warriors defeated the Jews. They killed some 1,100,000 and took nearly 100,000 into captivity. Moreover, the Romans demolished Jerusalem. This proved that the Jewish system of formerly approved worship that centered on the temple had permanently ended. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:2-58:1:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:2</a>) Yes, the events of 70 C.E. could rightly be considered ‘tribulation such as has not occurred [on that city, nation, and system] since the world’s beginning, no, nor will occur again.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>As Prophesied, More Was to Follow</strong></p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">15. (a) Jesus foretold what sort of developments to come after the tribulation on Jerusalem?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jesus, however, did not limit his prediction to the tribulation in the first century. The Bible shows that much was to follow that tribulation, as is suggested by the use of <em>toʹte, </em>or “then,” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:23-40:24:23" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 24:23 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:21-41:13:21" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Mark 13:21</a>. What would develop in the period following 70 C.E.? After the tribulation on the Jewish system, more false Christs and false prophets would appear. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:6-41:13:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Mark 13:6</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:21-41:13:23" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mr 13:21-23</a>.) History confirms that such individuals have arisen over the centuries since Jerusalem’s destruction in 70 C.E., though they have not misled people who have sharp spiritual vision and who have been looking to “the presence” of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:27-40:24:28" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 24:27, 28</a>) Nevertheless, these developments after the great tribulation of 70 C.E. form one indication that Jesus was looking beyond that tribulation, which was only an initial fulfillment.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>For a fourth and conclusive indication that Jesus’ prophecy about the conclusion of the system of things applies beyond the first century, we can turn to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:17" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 6</a>. Writing decades after 70 C.E., the apostle John described a compelling scene of active horsemen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:2-66:6:8" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Revelation 6:2-8</a>) This prophetic view into “the Lord’s day”​—the day of his presence—​identifies our 20th century as a time of notable warfare (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:4-66:6:4" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Re 6 verse 4</a>), widespread food shortages (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:5-66:6:6" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Re 6 verses 5 and 6</a>), and “deadly plague” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:8-66:6:8" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Re 6 verse 8</a>).

On this last point, <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report </em>(July 27, 1992) said: “The AIDS epidemic . . . is sending millions of victims to their death and may soon become the most costly and catastrophic plague in history.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>What, then, are we to conclude about how Jesus answered the apostles’ inquiry? His prophecy accurately foretold things <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>leading up to and encompassing the destruction of Jerusalem, and it mentioned some things to follow 70 C.E. But most of this was to have a second and greater fulfillment in the future, leading up to a great tribulation that would end the present wicked system of things. This means that Jesus’ prediction at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:4-40:24:22" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 24:4-22</a>, and the parallels in Mark and Luke, were fulfilled from 33 C.E. through the tribulation of 70 C.E. Yet, the same verses would have a second fulfillment, which would include a greater tribulation in the future. This larger fulfillment is with us; we can see it daily.<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>Leading Up to What?</strong></p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">21, 22. Where do we find prophetic indication that additional developments were to come?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Jesus did not end his prophecy with mention of false prophets performing deceptive signs during the long period before ‘the appointed times of the nations would be fulfilled.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:23-40:24:26" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:23-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:21-41:13:23" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> Mark 13:21-23</a>) He went on to tell of other startling things to occur, things observed earth wide. These would be associated with the coming of the Son of man in power and glory. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:27" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Mark 13:24-27</a> is representative of his continued prophecy:</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And then he will send forth the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.”</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">23. Why can we look for the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:31" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29-31</a> long after the first century C.E.?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>The Son of man, the resurrected Jesus Christ, did not come in that spectacular manner following the destructive end of the Jewish system in 70 C.E. Certainly all the tribes of the earth did not recognize him, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matthew 24:30</a> notes, nor did heavenly angels then gather all the anointed Christians from the entire earth. So when would this additional part of Jesus’ stupendous prophecy be fulfilled? Is it finding fulfillment in what is going on around us now, or does it, rather, provide divine insight into things that we can expect in the near future? We should certainly want to know, for Luke records Jesus’ admonition: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>.</p>

<div id="fn5" class="fcc"><p id="p35" data-pid="35">Many see in Luke’s account a shift after <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>. Dr. Leon Morris notes: “Jesus goes on to speak of <em>the times of the Gentiles. </em>. . . In the opinion of most scholars attention now moves to the coming of the Son of man.” Professor R. Ginns writes: <strong>“The Coming of the Son of Man​—</strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:31" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Mt 24:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:27" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Mk 13:24-27</a>). The mention of the ‘times of the Gentiles’ provides an introduction to this theme; [Luke’s] perspective is now carried beyond the ruin of Jerusalem into the future.”</p></div>
<div id="fn6" class="fcc"><p id="p36" data-pid="36">Professor Walter L. Liefeld writes: “It is certainly possible to assume that Jesus’ predictions incorporated two phases: (1) the events of <span class="altsize">A</span>.<span class="altsize">D</span>. 70 involving the temple and (2) those in the distant future, described in more apocalyptic terms.” The commentary edited by J. R. Dummelow says: “Many of the most serious difficulties of this great discourse disappear when it is realised that our Lord referred in it not to one event but to two, and that the first was typical of the second. . . . [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Luke] 21:24</a> especially, which speaks of ‘the times of the Gentiles,’ . . . places an indefinite interval between the fall of Jerusalem and the end of the world.”</p></div>

This was fulfilled with Jerusalem’s destruction in 70 C.E. But Jesus’ prophecy would have a greater fulfillment far down the stream of time. Once “the appointed times of the nations” ended in 1914, a sign on a vast scale would be available, manifesting that soon the present wicked system would end in a “great tribulation.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) Millions alive today can testify that this sign has been fulfilled in the world wars and other momentous events of this 20th century.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>When would that be fulfilled? All three Gospel accounts mention what we might call celestial phenomena​—sun and moon darkened and stars falling. Jesus said that these would <em>follow </em>“the tribulation.” Did Jesus have in mind the tribulation that climaxed in 70 C.E., or was he speaking of the great tribulation that is still future in our modern times?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:24" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Mark 13:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Ever since the appointed times of the nations ended in 1914, God’s people have been keenly interested in “the great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14</a>) For years they thought that the modern-day great tribulation had an opening part corresponding to the time of World War I, then an interrupting interval, and finally a concluding part, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” If that were so, what would occur during the intervening decades of the “conclusion of the system”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:39-40:13:39" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matthew 13:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 24:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 28:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Well, it was felt that during this interval the composite sign would be seen, including the preaching work done by God’s gathered people. It seemed also that the foretold celestial phenomena could be expected during the interval after the opening phase in 1914-18. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mark 13:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:25" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Luke 21:25</a>) Attention focused on literal things in the heavens​—space probes, rockets, cosmic or gamma rays, and landings or bases on the moon.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 7. What adjusted understanding about the great tribulation has been provided?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>However, <em>The Watchtower </em>of January 15, 1970, reexamined Jesus’ prophecy, especially the coming great tribulation. It showed that in view of what happened in the first century, the modern tribulation <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>could not have an opening part in 1914-18, a decades-long interval, and later a resumption. That magazine concluded: “The ‘great tribulation’ such as will not occur again <em>is yet ahead, </em>for it means the destruction of the world empire of false religion (including Christendom) followed by the ‘war of the great day of God the Almighty’ at Armageddon.”</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 8. With the adjusted view of the modern tribulation, how was <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29</a> explained?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>But <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29</a> says that the celestial phenomena come <em>“immediately after </em>the tribulation.” How could that be? <em>The Watchtower </em>of May 1, 1975, suggested that here “the tribulation” meant the one that climaxed back in 70 C.E. But in what sense could it be said that celestial phenomena of our time were taking place “immediately” after an event in 70 C.E.? It was reasoned that in God’s sight the centuries in between would be brief. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:8-61:3:8" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:8</a>) However, a deeper examination of this prophecy, particularly of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29-31</a>, points to quite a different explanation.

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 9. How do the Hebrew Scriptures provide background for Jesus’ words about developments in the heavens?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>To four of his apostles, Jesus gave the prophecy of ‘the sun being darkened, the moon not giving light, and the stars falling.’ As Jews, they would recognize such language from the Hebrew Scriptures, where at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:15-36:1:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:15</a>, for example, God’s time of judgment was called “a day of storm and of desolation, a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick gloom.” Various Hebrew prophets also described the sun as being darkened, the moon not shining, and the stars not giving light. You will find such language in divine messages against Babylon, Edom, Egypt, and the northern kingdom of Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:9-23:13:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 13:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:4-23:34:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 34:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:28-24:4:28" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 4:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:2-26:32:2" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Ezekiel 32:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:6-26:32:8" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:20-30:5:20" data-bid="16-6" class="b"> Amos 5:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:2-30:8:2" data-bid="16-7" class="b"> 8:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:9-30:8:9" data-bid="16-8" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What did Joel prophesy as to things in the heavens? (b) Which aspects of Joel’s prophecy were fulfilled in 33 C.E., and which were not?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>When they heard what Jesus said, Peter and the three others likely recalled Joel’s prophecy found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:28-29:2:31" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joel 2:28-31 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:15-29:3:15" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Joe 3:15</a>: “I shall pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will certainly prophesy. . . . I will give portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun itself will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah.” “Sun and moon themselves will certainly become dark, and the very stars will actually withdraw their brightness.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>As related at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:14-44:2:21" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 14-21</a>, at Pentecost 33 C.E., God poured out holy spirit on 120 disciples, both men and women. The apostle Peter made known that this was what Joel had foretold. What, though, of Joel’s words about ‘the sun being turned into darkness and the moon into blood and the stars withdrawing their brightness’? Nothing indicates that this was fulfilled in 33 C.E. or during the more than 30-year-long span of the conclusion of the Jewish system of things.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">12, 13. How were the celestial phenomena Joel foretold fulfilled?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Evidently that latter part of Joel’s prediction <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>was more closely linked with “the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah”​—the destruction of Jerusalem. <em>The Watchtower </em>of November 15, 1966, said about the tribulation that befell Jerusalem in 70 C.E.: “That was certainly a ‘day of Jehovah’ with reference to Jerusalem and her children. And in connection with that day there was plenty of ‘blood and fire and smoke mist,’ the sun not brightening the gloom of the city by day, and the moon suggesting shed blood, not peaceful, silvery moonlight by night.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Yes, as with other prophecies that we have noted, the celestial phenomena Joel foretold were to be fulfilled when Jehovah exacted judgment. Rather than extending over the conclusion of the Jewish system, the darkening of the sun, moon, and stars occurred when the executionary forces came against Jerusalem. Logically, we can expect a larger fulfillment of that part of Joel’s prophecy when God’s execution of the present system gets under way.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Which Tribulation Before Celestial Phenomena?</strong></p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">14, 15. What bearing does Joel’s prophecy have on our understanding of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29</a>?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>The fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy (in harmony with other prophecies using similar language) helps us to understand the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29</a>. Clearly, what Jesus said about ‘the sun being darkened, the moon not giving light, and the stars falling’ does not refer to things occurring over the many decades of the conclusion of the present system, such as space rocketry, moon landings, and the like. No, he pointed to things tied in with “the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” the destruction yet to come.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>This relates to our understanding of how the celestial phenomena would be <em>“immediately after </em>the tribulation.” Jesus was not referring to the tribulation that culminated in 70 C.E. Rather, he was pointing to the start of the great tribulation to befall the world system in the future, climaxing his promised “presence.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>) That tribulation is still ahead of us.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">16. To which tribulation was <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:24" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Mark 13:24</a> pointing, and why so?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>What about the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:24-41:13:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 13:24</a>: “In those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light”? Here, both “those” and “that” are forms of the Greek word <em>e·keiʹnos, </em>a demonstrative pronoun indicating something distant in time. <em>E·keiʹnos </em>can be used to indicate something long past (or previously mentioned) or something in the remote future.

At God’s fixed time, the great tribulation will begin with an attack against the world empire of false religion (Babylon the Great). This will be particularly intense against Christendom, which corresponds to unfaithful Jerusalem. “Immediately after” this phase of the tribulation, “there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth [unprecedented] anguish of nations.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 24:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:25" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Luke 21:25</a>.</p>

No doubt political powers too will have been shaken up. Could there also be frightening events in the physical heavens?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Jesus’ prophecy goes on to say, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:27-41:13:27" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mark 13:27</a>: “Then [<em>toʹte</em>] he will send forth the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.” Jesus here focuses on the remnant of the 144,000 “chosen ones” still alive on earth. Early in the conclusion of the system of things, these anointed disciples of Jesus were brought into theocratic unity. However, according to the sequence employed, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:27-41:13:27" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Mark 13:27 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:31</a> describe something else. “With a great trumpet sound,” the remaining “chosen ones” will be gathered from the ends of the earth. How will they be gathered? Unquestionably, they will be “sealed” and clearly identified by Jehovah as part of “those called and chosen and faithful.” And at God’s designated time, they will be gathered up to heaven to be king-priests.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> This will bring joy to them and to their faithful companions, the “great crowd,” who will themselves be marked for ‘coming out of the great tribulation’ to enjoy blessings on a paradise earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:22-40:24:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matthew 24:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:3-66:7:4" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 9-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:14-66:17:14" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="42-6" class="b"> Ezekiel 9:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:6-26:9:6" data-bid="42-7" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>When the apostles said, “Tell us . . . ,” Jesus’ reply covered more than they could grasp. Yet, within their lifetime they rejoiced to see the typical fulfillment of his prophecy. Our study of Jesus’ reply has focused on the part of his prophecy that will come to pass in the near future.

We can look forward to the start of the great tribulation, <em>then </em>the sign of the Son of man, and <em>then </em>God’s gathering of the chosen ones. Finally, as Jehovah’s Executioner at Armageddon, our Warrior-King, the enthroned Jesus, will “complete his conquest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:2-66:6:2" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Revelation 6:2</a>) That day of Jehovah, when he executes vengeance, will come as a grand finale to the conclusion of the system of things that has marked the day of the Lord Jesus from 1914 onward.</p>

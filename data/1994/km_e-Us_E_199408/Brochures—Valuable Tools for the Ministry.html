<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A skilled craftsman usually carries an assortment of tools, each designed for a specific task. As Kingdom proclaimers, we have a large assortment of brochures to help us skillfully meet the spiritual needs of the people to whom we preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:29-20:22:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 22:29</a>) At one door you may meet someone who is depressed. At another the householder longs for honest government, while someone else wonders if there is any purpose in living. How can we use our brochures to help these people?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?,” you might say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Some people who observe the suffering and injustice in the world tend to blame it all on God. They reason that since God is almighty, he would put an end to our suffering if he really cared for us. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12-14</a> shows that God does indeed care about us. Suffering and injustice are not his fault. He has promised that wrongdoers will soon be removed. This brochure, <em>Does God Really Care About Us?, </em>shows what he will do and how we can benefit.” You may be able to continue the discussion with comments on page 27, paragraph 22.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you are using the “Purpose of Life” brochure, you might want to begin this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Sooner or later, nearly everyone wonders about the purpose of life. Is it merely to live 70 or 80 years and then go to the grave? Or is there more to life? What do you think? [Allow for response.] Here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>, we see God’s beautiful purpose for man and the earth.” After reading the scripture, turn to the illustration on page 31, and comment further about what it will be like to live in Paradise.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>The “Look!” brochure could be introduced by displaying the entire cover illustration and asking:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “What do you think it would take to make the earth look like this? [Allow for comment.] Everyone in this picture has a home and enjoyable work. There is peace and plenty to eat, and the earth is without pollution. Hard as they may try, human governments find it is impossible for them to bring about such a world. However, the Bible assures us that God will ‘make all things new.’ [Turn to page 30, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.] This brochure can help you learn what you need to do to live in that new world.” If sufficient interest is shown, turn to page 3, and demonstrate how we conduct a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might use this approach with the “Life on Earth” brochure:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Many people think they will have to go to heaven in order to enjoy everlasting life, but what would you think of living on earth forever? [Allow for a response.] The Bible assures us that eternal life is possible, and it tells us how we can reach that goal.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>. Then show the householder illustration 49 and ask: “How would you like to live in a world like this?” Offer the brochure, and arrange for a return visit.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The brochures feature timely subjects, answer people’s questions, and give comfort. Using these tools skillfully, we can help sincere ones to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>.</p>

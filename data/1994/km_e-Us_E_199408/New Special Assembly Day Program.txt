New Special Assembly Day Program
1 Our special assembly day program starting in September will feature the theme “Keep Bearing Witness to the Truth.” The entire program will focus on the example Jesus left us and how he took advantage of every opportunity to share the truth with others. It will emphasize our responsibility as disciples of Christ to imitate him in bearing witness to the truth.​—1 Cor. 11:1.
2 The role the congregation plays in promoting the truth will be considered. Making good use of our magazines and other publications will also be stressed.
3 The principal talk by the visiting speaker is entitled “Bearing Witness to the Truth​—What It Accomplishes.” (John 8:32) This special assembly day program will surely deepen our appreciation for the truth and help all of us to remain steadfast and “firmly set in the truth.”​—2 Pet. 1:12; 1 Cor. 15:58.

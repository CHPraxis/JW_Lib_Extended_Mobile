<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The ministry has rightly been likened to farming, and making return visits has been compared to cultivating and watering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:2-42:10:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 10:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:10-47:9:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:10</a>) As “God’s fellow workers,” we have an obligation to help any newly sprouted seed to grow to maturity and become fruitful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9</a>) How can we best accomplish this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Be prompt in making return visits on all who show interest. Review your house-to-house records, and decide whom to visit and what to discuss. Generally your subject for discussion will be determined by what was discussed on the initial visit. Be flexible, having in mind other Scriptural thoughts that may be introduced. It is always good to use the Bible, recognizing its power to reach the heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you left the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?,” you might begin by saying something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “Many sincere people believe that God is going to destroy the earth, while others fear that man will do that himself. What do you think? [Allow for response.] The Bible tells us that instead of destroying the earth, God will cleanse it of unrighteousness, making it a place of peace and security.” Direct attention to page 22, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>, which is quoted there. If interest is manifest, explain the home Bible study arrangement or offer the latest magazines, and make an appointment to return and discuss more about God’s promised new world.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you placed the “Look!” brochure, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “On my previous visit, we read in the Bible about God’s promise to make the earth a paradise, like the one illustrated on the cover of the brochure I left with you. We can enjoy this blessing by learning more about God’s will and how it affects us.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, and then turn to paragraphs 52 and 53 on page 27. Briefly discuss why there is a need to take in accurate knowledge of God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>When following up a placement of the “Purpose of Life” brochure with a person who is religiously inclined, you may find it appropriate to say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “Very likely you’ve repeated the Lord’s Prayer many times. What thought comes to your mind when you ask for God’s Kingdom to come?” Following the householder’s response, refer to paragraphs 8 and 9 on page 26, and then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>. Perhaps you could continue the conversation by explaining that the coming of God’s Kingdom will mean an end to wickedness and suffering. Point out that if we are righteous in God’s eyes, we can enjoy everlasting life in Paradise on this earth.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Remember that a return visit can be made on anyone who was willing to listen, whether literature was placed or not. Try to set aside some time every week for making return visits. Jehovah will bless your diligent effort to cultivate the interest you find. May it bear fruitage to his praise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:8-43:15:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 15:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DESSERT? . . . DESSERT! . . . Have you planned a dinner for guests and then asked yourself, ‘What shall I serve for dessert?’ Perhaps this common dilemma has prompted you to pore over your recipes and all your cookbooks in search of the perfect dessert for your get-​together.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Would you like to try a fondue? Not only is it a natural conversation piece but it’s quick and easy to prepare too. What is a fondue? Quite simply, it is a mixture of certain ingredients that are melted in a pot. Then, other foods, which we will style “dippers,” are dipped into the mixture and eaten. The word fondue comes from the French word <em>fondre </em>meaning “to melt.” For example, in a chocolate dessert fondue, the mixture is basically melted chocolate, and the dippers are pastry and fresh fruit.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Chocolate Dessert Fondue</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To the left is a chocolate dessert fondue recipe. If you have never tried it, you are in for a delightful surprise!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Melt the chocolate in a saucepan. Add the remaining ingredient(s). Stir until the mixture is thickened. Transfer the mixture to a fondue pot, and keep it warm over a low-​heat source.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Before you begin dipping into the fondue, you may want to stir in two teaspoons of instant coffee or one quarter teaspoon of cinnamon. To keep fruit dippers from turning dark, sprinkle them with lemon juice mixed with water. If the chocolate mixture is too thin, add more chocolate. If it is too thick, thin it with milk.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If you are using an electric fondue pot or a stovetop-​safe fondue pot, you may prepare and serve in the same pot. Place the fondue pot in the center of the table within easy reach of everyone. One pot serves six to eight persons.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If some sauce is left over, it stores well in the refrigerator and makes an excellent topping for ice cream.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><strong>Swiss Cheese Fondue</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Would you like to try a cheese fondue? To the right is a recipe for either an appetizer or a main dish.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Rub the inside of a saucepan with the cut side of a garlic clove, then discard the garlic. Pour the wine and lemon juice into the pan, and warm it over medium heat. Bubbles will rise and cover the surface. Do not allow the wine to boil.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In a bowl combine cornstarch or flour with the shredded cheese, and stir.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">While stirring the wine mixture constantly, add a handful of cheese. After the cheese melts, add another handful of cheese, and stir until it melts. Continue in this manner until all the cheese is melted. If desired, season with white pepper and nutmeg or paprika and ground clove.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Transfer it to the fondue pot, and set it over a low to medium heat source. Each person has his own long-​handled fondue fork, dinner plate, and dinner fork. Simply spear one of the dippers and swirl it around in a circular or <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>figure-​eight fashion in the fondue. Place the dipper on your dinner plate, and eat it with your dinner fork.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">If the fondue is too thin, add more cheese. If it becomes too thick, stir in some heated wine. If the mixture separates, heat it at a high temperature, beat it with a whisk, and then lower the heat. The mixture should not separate if you stir it with the dipper every time you dip.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If you prefer a nonalcoholic base for your fondue, prepare a basic cheese-​sauce recipe. Mix four tablespoons each of butter and flour. Cook the mixture over low heat. Add two cups <strong>[4.8 dl] </strong>of cold milk, bring slowly to boil, and cook the mixture for two minutes. Gradually add one and one half cups <strong>[3.6 dl] </strong>of sharp cheese (shredded) and stir until it is melted. Season with salt and pepper. Dip as described above.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>A Sweet Ending</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The next time you face the dessert dilemma, you may decide to give chocolate fondue a whirl. Or for dinner, perhaps you will serve beef fondue.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">No doubt this melting pot of fine flavors will long be a favorite with you and your friends. Its appeal derives from the common pot. Everyone dips in, creating a warm atmosphere of friendship, the main ingredient of this conversation piece you can eat!​<em>—Contributed.</em></p>

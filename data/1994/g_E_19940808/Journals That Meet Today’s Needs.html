<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!​</em>—over 58 million copies of which are printed each month in more than a hundred languages—​have been doing just that. An appreciative reader wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Thank you very much for publishing articles that deal with the real issues facing many.” He also stated:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“As the end of this world draws near, people need empathy, understanding, and insight to help them cope with their problems. More and more, the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are addressing the reasons <em>why </em>people sometimes fail . . .</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Most want to do what is right, but they often struggle with frustrations, guilt, negative emotions, fears, low self-​esteem, poor mental habits, and the feeling that they are powerless to help themselves. Your articles are helping many to regain control of their lives and emotions. . . .</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I want to thank you especially for the January 22, 1994, <em>Awake! </em>on ‘Communication in Marriage.’ Instead of offering platitudes on the importance of communication, you delve into the reasons why men and women fail to understand one another. By helping half the population to understand the other half, you have done a great service to humanity and to the God-​given institution of marriage.”</p>

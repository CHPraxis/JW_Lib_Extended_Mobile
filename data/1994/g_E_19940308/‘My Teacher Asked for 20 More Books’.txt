‘My Teacher Asked for 20 More Books’
SEVENTEEN-​YEAR-​OLD Daniel was given an assignment at his high school in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., to prepare information on an Asian religion. He says: “The teacher encouraged us to go to the library for research. I knew that the book Mankind’s Search for God, published by the Watch Tower Society, would be a tremendous help. I took it to school and showed it to the teacher. She was so impressed by its objectivity, accuracy, and question-​and-​answer format that she ordered 20 copies for the whole class. They are now school property and are used for each succeeding class. A $50 donation was given to help our worldwide educational work.”
Mankind’s Search for God is a 384-​page book that traces mankind’s search for God through the major religions of the world. It has been translated into 34 languages, and over 15 million copies have been distributed.

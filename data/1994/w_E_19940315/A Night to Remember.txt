A Night to Remember
ON A memorable day over 3,500 years ago, Jehovah God had the enslaved Israelites in Egypt kill a lamb and sprinkle its blood on the doorposts and lintels of their houses. That very night, God’s angel passed over the houses marked in this way but killed the firstborn sons in the homes of all the Egyptians. The Israelites were then freed. Ever since, on the anniversary of that event, Jews have celebrated the Passover.
Immediately after Jesus Christ finished celebrating his last Passover with his apostles, he instituted a meal that would memorialize his sacrificial death. He handed his faithful apostles bread and said: “Take, eat. This means my body.” Then he gave them a cup of wine and said: “Drink out of it, all of you; for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” Jesus also said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Matthew 26:26-28; Luke 22:19, 20) So Jesus commanded his followers to hold this observance of his death.
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to join them in observing this Memorial of Jesus’ death. You can attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest your home. Check with Witnesses in your locality for the exact time and place. The date for the observance in 1994 is Saturday, March 26, the bread and the wine being served after sundown.

Develop Interest in God’s Kingdom of Peace
1 During the month of February, we will be featuring the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. Our aim should be to help honesthearted people develop an appreciation for God’s Kingdom and what it will accomplish. Viewpoint questions can help us to this end.
2 After a friendly greeting, we might say something like this:
▪ “Startling changes in government are taking place earth wide, and the goal of peace is often mentioned. Do you feel that true peace will ever be achieved? [Allow for comment.] Although many look hopefully to human rulers to bring about peace, note how God promises to bring peace as mentioned at Psalm 46:9. [Read.] What changes on earth do you think God’s action will bring? [Listen to householder’s response, and then show tract Life in a Peaceful New World.] Can you visualize what is pictured here?” Consider the information under the subheading “Life in God’s New World.” If the situation allows, further information from the Reasoning book, pages 227-32, under the question “What will God’s Kingdom accomplish?,” can be considered. We may conclude the discussion by asking: “Do you think that a government by God would bring about these changes?” If the householder shows interest, arrangements should be made for a return visit.
3 Or we might say:
▪ “Much concern is expressed about disturbing problems that all of us have to deal with on a daily basis. Do you feel there is any hope for relief from these problems? [Allow for comment.] Some might feel that God is indifferent to our plight. Note, though, what he promises at Revelation 21:3, 4.” Read the verses. At this point the Live Forever book, a current magazine, or the tract Will This World Survive? may be featured. If the tract is offered, consideration can be given to the material on pages 2 and 3 under the heading “The Future of This World.” If interest is shown, you may decide which other item of literature to offer. If you offer the brochure Does God Really Care About Us?, the question may be raised: “Why has God permitted suffering?” Point out part 6 in the brochure, and arrange to discuss this on the next visit.
4 You may choose to feature an article from one of the current magazines by making a comment on a specific point in a selected article.
If the householder expresses interest, introduce the magazine, perhaps by saying:
▪ “This article goes into more detail on the subject. [Read a previously selected sentence or two.] The article provides additional thoughts that will prove encouraging to you and your family. Since you seem to be interested in this subject, we would be pleased to leave this issue and its companion magazine with you.” If the householder accepts the magazines, it may be appropriate to mention the donation arrangement.
5 People today are often confused when it comes to knowing where to turn for answers to the problems facing mankind. We have the privilege of sharing with them a clear hope for the future. (Acts 17:27) May we, then, diligently direct people’s attention to God’s Kingdom, the true source of peace.

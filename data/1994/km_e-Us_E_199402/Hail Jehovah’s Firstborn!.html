<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>On Sunday, Nisan 9, 33 C.E., a great crowd with palm branches in their hands hailed Jehovah’s firstborn Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as “the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:38-42:19:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 19:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:6-58:1:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:6</a>) On Monday and Tuesday, Nisan 10 and 11, Jesus was intensely occupied with his public ministry, making those final days among the busiest of his earthly life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Today, an even greater crowd with figurative palm branches in hand cry out with a loud voice: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10</a>) On March 26, we will meet to celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. As that date approaches, can we intensify our efforts in the ministry and thus add to this global shout of praise?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Increase Field Activity: </strong>Many publishers have already enrolled as auxiliary pioneers during March. Would you like to join them? If so, turn in your application without delay. One of the elders will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the work.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Whether you can serve as an auxiliary pioneer or not, you will want to have a full share in the ministry during March. The congregation may be able to arrange for group witnessing every day during the month. Sufficient territory should be set aside for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>All congregations should arrange for a special meeting for field service for Saturday, March 26. Although there is much to do in preparation for the Memorial, it is recommended that everyone who is able to do so engage in the field ministry on Saturday morning. In addition to working from house to house, be sure that those you have invited to attend the Memorial have transportation and that they have the time and place of the meeting clearly in mind.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Invite and Encourage Others: </strong>Jesus commanded his followers: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:24-46:11:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:24</a>) As Jesus’ anointed footstep followers obey that command, every servant of Jehovah is invited to attend and observe the Memorial celebration. Among others, you should invite Bible students, relatives, those with whom you have had Bible discussions, unbelieving mates, and business acquaintances. Make a list so that no one is overlooked.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>There will be additional opportunities for encouraging interested people at the Memorial itself. Be sure to arrive early so that you can greet new ones who are attending for the first time. If several of your Bible students attend, it may be practical for another publisher to sit with some of them during the meeting. Invite newcomers to attend the congregation’s regular Public Meeting. The elder selected to present the public talk should be well prepared to deliver a stimulating discourse.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>At the conclusion of the Memorial celebration, as we join our voices in singing song 105, “Hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!,” may we be able to look back with satisfaction on a zealous month of theocratic activity to Jehovah’s praise!</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines, as well as any brochure (except the School brochure). Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14).
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the requirement of hours, elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1, 1993, and October 1, 1992. Also, see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ The Memorial celebration will be held Saturday, March 26, 1994. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine should not begin until after sundown. Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than for field service are to be held on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Saturday, you may want to switch those to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available.
▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March and April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient literature on hand.
▪ On Saturday, May 14, 1994, the Brooklyn Bethel Home and factory, as well as Watchtower Farms buildings, will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.
▪ Another release on computer diskette is available: GetVerse. This new program allows a user to insert Bible texts directly into most DOS word processors. This is helpful in preparing talks or in making lists of scriptures. GetVerse is available only in English on one 5 1/4-inch 360-kilobyte or 3 1/2-inch 720-kilobyte diskette. To use this program, you must have a copy of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References or the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—​With References/​Insight on the Scriptures installed and working on your computer.

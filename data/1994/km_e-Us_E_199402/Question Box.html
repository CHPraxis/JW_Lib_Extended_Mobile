<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ What procedure should be followed when presenting resolutions to the congregation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A resolution is required when a decision must be made about important matters such as purchasing property, remodeling or building a Kingdom Hall, sending special contributions to the Society, or caring for the circuit overseer’s expenses. It is usually best to present a resolution for approval each time congregation funds are dispensed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As an exception, the congregation might resolve once to contribute a specific amount each month to the Society in addition to what each individual is contributing toward the worldwide preaching work already. Also, normal Kingdom Hall operating expenses, such as utilities and cleaning supplies, do not require a resolution.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When a need becomes evident, the body of elders should discuss the matter thoroughly. If the majority are in agreement that something needs to be done, one of the elders, perhaps a member of the Congregation Service Committee, should prepare a written resolution for presentation at the Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The elder acting as chairman should briefly but clearly explain the need that exists and what the body of elders recommends to care for it. The congregation is then given opportunity to ask pertinent questions. If the matter is complicated, it may be best to delay the vote until the next Service Meeting to give everyone time to think about it. The actual vote is taken by a show of hands.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Voting on the resolution is limited to dedicated and baptized members of the congregation unless legal requirements direct otherwise, as may be the case when corporation matters or Kingdom Hall loans are involved. It would not be appropriate for visitors from other congregations to participate.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After the resolution has been approved, it should be dated, signed, and placed in the congregation file.</p>

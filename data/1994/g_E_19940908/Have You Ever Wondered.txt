Have You Ever Wondered?
WHAT is one of the major stumbling blocks that separates Muslims and Jews from the religions of Christendom? It is the teaching of the “Most Holy Trinity.” What does this dogma state? The Trinity was defined in the Athanasian Creed as the worship of “one God in Trinity . . . The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; and yet they are not three gods, but one God.” Each is said to be eternal, to be almighty, with none greater or lesser than another; each said to be God, and yet together being but one God. Theologians describe it as a mystery.

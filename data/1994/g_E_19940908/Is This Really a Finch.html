<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FINCHES are known the world over. They live on all continents except frigid Antarctica. Even many ocean islands have their finch population. And they are usually quite pretty. Take the American goldfinch as an example. They “add a special liveliness to wide-​open country with their bright, yellow and black coloring . . . , their roller coaster flights over invisible hills and valleys of the air, and their sweet twitterings of <em>Just-​look-​at-​me!</em>”​—<em>Book of North American Birds.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, there is one finch that takes the prize for spectacular beauty​—the five-​inch-​long Gouldian weaverfinch, found in northern Australia, especially in the eucalyptus savannas. You might find some captive in bird cages in your country. One encyclopedia states: “This has contributed to a marked decline in recent years.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Finches have beaks that are designed internally for holding and shelling seeds. “Each seed is wedged in a special groove at the side of the palate and crushed by raising the lower jaw onto it. The husk is then peeled off with the aid of the tongue, thus releasing the kernel, which is swallowed.” (<em>Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World</em>) As for the Gouldian finch, however, “instead of taking [the seeds] from the ground it perches acrobatically on the seed heads, or picks out the seeds while clinging to a nearby twig.”​—<em>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Birds</em>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If ever you get to see a Gouldian finch, feel blessed to have witnessed such a colorful creation in such a small bird.</p>

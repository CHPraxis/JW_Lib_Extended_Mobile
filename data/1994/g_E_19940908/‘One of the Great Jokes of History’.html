<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I MYSELF am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it’s been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books in the future. Posterity will marvel that so very flimsy and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with the incredible credulity that it has.” Those were the words of British broadcaster and writer Malcolm Muggeridge (1903-90) in lectures he gave at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. He added: “I think I spoke to you before about this age as one of the most credulous in history, and I would include evolution as an example.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then why do so many scientists accept evolution? That question and many others are considered in detail in the 254-​page book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>If you would like to read this book, feel free to contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area, or write to the nearest address listed on page 5.</p>

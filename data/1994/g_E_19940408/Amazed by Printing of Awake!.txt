Amazed by Printing of Awake!
AN AWAKE! READER IN MINNESOTA, U.S.A., works for a college where marine biologist Sam LaBudde was scheduled to deliver a presentation entitled “Where Have the Dolphins Gone?” Remembering that he had been quoted in the Awake! article “Drift-​Net Fishing on the Way Out?” (May 22, 1992), she took the magazine along to the lecture.
“On the magazine I wrote a note addressed to Mr. LaBudde. I said that I thought he would enjoy knowing that this fine article was going to be distributed worldwide in many languages and that the magazine had a printing of over 13,000,000. Then I signed my name and laid the Awake! open on the podium and returned to my seat.
“Shortly I saw a man go over to the podium, pick up the magazine, and begin reading. After a few minutes, he looked up and asked loudly if the person who left the magazine was present. When I raised my hand and said, ‘I am,’ he came down and sat next to me. He thanked me for the magazine and said that he appreciates it when someone presents to him information that highlights the work or accomplishments in his field. He felt, though, that I might have made a mistake by saying that the printing was 13,000,000. He thought I must mean 13,000. I turned to the front of the magazine and showed him that it was 13,000,000. He was amazed. He was also very impressed by the number of languages the magazine was published in [now 74 languages]. He thought the magazine was distributed only in the United States, but I explained how it is done worldwide.”

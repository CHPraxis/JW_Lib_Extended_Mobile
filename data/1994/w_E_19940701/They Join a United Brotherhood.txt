They Join a United Brotherhood
It was August 7, 1993, at the Republican Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine. The more than 64,000 in attendance looked on with expectation as the moment arrived. Then, in reply to two meaningful questions, thousands called out “Da!” (“Yes!”) In this way, they made a public declaration of their faith and then went on to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah God by being baptized in one of the six pools in the stadium.​—Matthew 28:19.
Thus, on this third day of the international “Divine Teaching” Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the audience beheld an outstanding event: 7,402 were baptized and became part, not of a divided church, but of a united worldwide Christian congregation.

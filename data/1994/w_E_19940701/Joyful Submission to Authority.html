<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">“THE spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience” is shockingly evident today. It is a spirit of unbridled independence, emanating from Satan, “the ruler of the authority of the air.” This spirit, this “air,” or dominant attitude of selfishness and disobedience, exerts “authority,” or power, over most of mankind. This is one reason why the world is going through what has been called a crisis of authority.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The key to willing submission is recognition of legitimate authority. The history of mankind shows that rejection of Jehovah’s sovereignty does not bring happiness. Such rejection did not bring happiness to Adam and Eve, nor to the instigator of their rebellion, Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:16-19</a>) In his present debased condition, Satan has “great anger” because he knows that his time is short.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Yet, because of his marvelously balanced qualities, Jehovah is not satisfied with cold obedience. He is powerful, oh, yes! But he is not a tyrant. He is a God of love, and he wants his intelligent creatures to obey him willingly, out of love. He wants them to submit to his sovereignty because they wholeheartedly choose to place themselves under his righteous and legitimate authority, convinced that there could be nothing better for them than to obey him forever. The kind of person that Jehovah wants in his universe shares the feelings of the psalmist who wrote: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, bringing back the soul. The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise. The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice; the commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine. The fear of Jehovah is pure, standing forever. The judicial decisions of Jehovah are true; they have proved altogether righteous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-9</a>) Implicit confidence in the rightness and the righteousness of Jehovah’s sovereignty​—this must be our attitude if we want to live in Jehovah’s new world.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Theocratic Submission</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. (a) How might a person respect headship and yet not be really theocratic? Illustrate. (b) What does it mean to be truly theocratic?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Theocracy is rule by God. It involves the principle of headship expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>. But it means more than that. A person might appear to show respect for headship and yet not be theocratic in the full sense of the word. How could this be? To illustrate, democracy is government by the people, and a democrat has been defined as “a person who believes in the ideals of democracy.” A man might claim to be democratic, take part in elections, and even be an active politician. But if, in his general behavior, he flouts the spirit of democracy and all the principles it involves, can it be said that he is truly democratic? Similarly, to be truly theocratic, a person must do more than submit to headship in a nominal way. He must imitate Jehovah’s ways and qualities. He must really be governed by Jehovah in every way. And since Jehovah has invested his Son with full authority, being theocratic also means copying Jesus.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13. (a) What, in particular, does being theocratic involve? (b) Does theocratic submission involve obeying a lot of rules? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Remember, Jehovah wants willing submission motivated by love. That is his way of governing the universe. He is the very personification of love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) Christ Jesus is “the reflection of his glory and the exact representation of his very being.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:3-58:1:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:3</a>) He requires his true disciples to love one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:17-43:15:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 15:17</a>) So being <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>theocratic involves not only being submissive but also being loving. The matter might be summed up as follows: Theocracy is rule by God; God is love; therefore theocracy is rule by love.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>An elder could think that in order to be theocratic, the brothers should obey all sorts of rules. Some elders have made rules out of suggestions given from time to time by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) For instance, it was once suggested that for the sake of more readily getting to know the brothers in the congregation, it might be good not always to sit in the same seat in the Kingdom Hall. This was meant to be a practical suggestion, not a hard-and-fast rule. But some elders may be inclined to convert it into a rule and to feel that those who do not follow it are not theocratic. Yet, there may be many good reasons why a brother or a sister might prefer to sit in a certain area. If an elder does not lovingly take such things into account, is he himself being truly theocratic? To be theocratic, “let all your affairs take place with love.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:14-46:16:14" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Serving With Joy</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14, 15. (a) How could an elder deprive certain brothers or sisters of their joy in serving Jehovah, and why would this not be theocratic? (b) How did Jesus show that he appreciates the love expressed by our service, rather than the amount? (c) What should elders take into consideration?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Being theocratic also means serving Jehovah with joy. Jehovah is “the happy God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:11</a>) He wants his worshipers to serve him joyfully. Those who are sticklers for rules should remember that among the regulations that Israel had to be “careful to carry out” was the following: “You must rejoice before Jehovah your God in every undertaking of yours.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:1-5:12:1" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 12:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:18-5:12:18" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Whatever we undertake in Jehovah’s service should be a joy, not a burden. Overseers can do much to make the brothers feel happy to do what they can in serving Jehovah. Conversely, if elders are not careful, they can deprive some of the brothers of their joy. If, for example, they make comparisons, commending those who have reached or exceeded the congregation’s average in hours spent witnessing and by implication criticizing those who did not attain it, how will those feel who may have had a valid reason for reporting much less time? Could this not make them feel unnecessarily guilty and deprive them of their joy?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>The few hours that some can devote to public witnessing may represent a greater effort than the many hours that others spend preaching, in view of younger age, better health, and other circumstances. In this respect, elders are not to judge them. Indeed, it is to Jesus that the Father has given “authority to do judging.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:27-43:5:27" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 5:27</a>) Did Jesus criticize the poor widow because her offering was less than the average? No, he was sensitive to what those two small coins really cost her. They were “all of what she had, her whole living.” What deep love for Jehovah they represented! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:41-41:12:44" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Mark 12:41-44</a>) Should elders be any less sensitive to the loving efforts of those whose all is numerically below “average”? In terms of love for Jehovah, such efforts might well be above average!</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16. (a) If overseers use figures in their talks, why do they need discernment and good balance? (b) How can the brothers best be helped to increase their service?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Should these remarks now be converted into a new “rule” that figures​—even averages—​should never be mentioned? Not at all! The point is that overseers should strike a balance between encouraging the brothers to expand their ministry and helping them <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>to do what they can with joy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>) In Jesus’ illustration of the talents, the master committed his belongings to his slaves “each one according to his own ability.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:14-40:25:15" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matthew 25:14, 15</a>) Elders likewise should take into account the possibilities of each Kingdom publisher. This takes discernment. It may well be that some actually do need encouragement to do more. They may appreciate help toward better organizing their activity. Be that as it may, if they can be assisted to do what they can with joy, that joy will likely strengthen them to expand their Christian activity where possible.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:59:16-19:59:16" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Psalm 59:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:20:9-24:20:9" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 20:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LAST April, four years after the disastrous <em>Exxon Valdez </em>oil spill in Prince William Sound, Exxon’s scientists finally issued their findings. According to <em>New Scientist </em>magazine, Exxon said that “the damage from the spill lasted only a few months and that Prince William Sound had recovered almost completely.” Far different were the assessments of U.S. government scientists who had spent four years studying the effects of the spill: “It’s very clear that long-​term recovery is far from complete. In some cases it will take many years.” They charged: “Exxon is picking and choosing the information it is using to assess recovery.” The following excerpts from the findings of marine biologist and commercial fisherman Rick Steiner give the current conditions in the sound.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Particularly striking is the dearth of sea otters, harlequin ducks, murres and oystercatchers. . . . In inter-​tidal zones, mussel mats retain oil trapped four years ago. . . . Fishermen had to wait until last summer’s salmon return to see if the oil had harmed the progeny of the juvenile pink salmon that had emerged at the time of the spill. The return was disastrous: only one-​quarter to one-​third of what had been projected. . . . State and federal scientists have found the effects of the oil in organisms from fish to whales​—in such forms as brain damage, reproductive failure, genetic damage, structural deformities such as curved spines, lethargy, lowered growth rates and body weights, changed feeding habits, reduced egg volume, eye tumors, increased numbers of parasites, liver damage and behavioral abnormalities.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“If anything has become clear, it is that there is really no such thing as oil-​spill restoration. We simply cannot fix a broken ecosystem like we can a broken machine. For many, this realization has been a bitter pill to swallow.”​—<em>National Wildlife EnviroAction.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One government scientist states: “The way the studies are done is not impartial. The science is driven by lawyers, who decide which studies will support claims for damages​—or which will help to counter the claims.” <em>New Scientist </em>raises the pertinent question: “Is science of any use when powerful vested interests are at stake?”</p>

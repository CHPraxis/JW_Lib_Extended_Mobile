It Caused Her to Pray
Karen, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York State, said that she sent her mother the book Listening to the Great Teacher. “I gave Mom the book,” Karen wrote, “for my nine-​year-​old niece, Jamie, to read at night.” Karen explained: “I wrote Jamie a letter and said she should read it every night at Grandma’s, and she would have good thoughts before going to sleep.”
Karen’s mother, who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, later told Karen that Jamie went to bed and began reading the book. The next morning she said she had prayed for her baby brother (who was having an operation) before she went to sleep. Karen’s mother was quite moved by this because she didn’t think that Jamie had ever prayed before.
Karen wrote: “That’s a pretty powerful book if it can cause a nine-​year-​old to pray after reading only a small portion of it. This made me appreciate even more the power of this literature. I think it even impressed my mom because she said she noticed that the book asks a lot of questions and obviously teaches morals and not just stories.”

Can They Benefit You?
THE magazine you have in your hand is designed to be a source of encouragement, calling to mind Bible guidelines for stabilizing families and maintaining personal integrity. It shows that today’s troubled times were foretold in the Bible, and it highlights the solution​—God’s Kingdom government. Can you benefit from The Watchtower and from Awake!, its companion magazine?
From the Philippines a woman named Vilma wrote: “If there is any word to describe your publications, I think I would go for ‘marvelous.’ I saw and read for the first time your Awake! and The Watchtower when I was on a bus returning home from Manila. I usually carry newspapers when I travel, but this time I did not take any along.
“Sitting next to me on the trip was a middle-aged man who had your publications. After he read Awake!, he brought out another magazine, The Watchtower. I seized the opportunity to borrow Awake! In all honesty, I really enjoyed reading those magazines because the articles were all interesting, timely, and uplifting.”
The woman concluded: “I do want to receive your magazines. Please let me know how I can receive them.” The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Philippines was happy to oblige by adding this woman to their mailing list.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Most people have come to some kind of conclusion about the origin of life. Sad to say, many have been wrongly influenced to accept evolution as the answer. The <em>Creation </em>book takes an in-depth look at both sides of the issue and offers overwhelming proof in support of the Bible. How can we help sincere people who have displayed a willingness to listen? By making return visits. When we return, it is always good to have something definite in mind to say that will build faith in Jehovah as our Creator.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If the person manifested belief in the Bible, this approach might be effective for starting your conversation:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a> makes a powerful statement about the origin of the universe; I’d like to know what you think about it. [Read and allow for comment.] Jehovah identifies himself as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. What about <em>life </em>on this earth? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5</a> gives him all the credit for that too. [Read.] If what the Bible says is true, evolution must be false. Do you feel you can trust the Bible?” Refer to <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985027/">chapter 17 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book, and point out further reasons for believing in Jehovah as the Creator.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You could begin your conversation with something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “On my last visit, the question was raised, What is the future of man and the earth? Notice how the book I left with you answers that question.” Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985029/8-10">pages 234-5 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book and encourage him to read paragraphs 6 and 7. If further interest is shown, you might ask: “What dramatic changes, do you think, will take place on the earth?” If appropriate, this point can be discussed at that time or on your next visit by continuing into other paragraphs in this same chapter of the <em>Creation </em>book.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If the householder appeared somewhat religiously inclined, you might ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Have you noticed that many people today give credit to an impersonal nature or a personification called Mother Nature? [Allow for comment.] The Bible does not leave us in the dark as to the real Creator.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>. After the scripture is read, the householder may express himself. You can then call attention to a specific point or two from <a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985021/">chapter 11 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book and perhaps highlight the Creator’s purpose to make all the earth into a paradise under Christ’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Another way you could begin the return visit is by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Mankind has suffered much pain and sorrow because of evil and wickedness. Jehovah, the Creator of this earth, has promised that these conditions will come to an end. [Turn to page 196, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.] Those who recognize him as their Maker and do his will can look forward to marvelous blessings.” If appropriate at the time, continue with a discussion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4, 5</a> on pages 197-8.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Experienced publishers have come to know that it is best to schedule set times for return visits. Having definite arrangements for this work will help us to follow up interest promptly. Determine the time that is best for you and for the people living in the territory. By your sharing regularly in this work, you will find joy in fulfilling the commission to “make disciples.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Godly Fear” District Convention and for a 30-minute review of the program highlights the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</p>

By Evolution or by Creation? </em><strong>July: </strong>A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they may now have on hand. <strong>August: </strong>Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: <em>Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, </em>and <em>What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It? </em><strong>September: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.</p>

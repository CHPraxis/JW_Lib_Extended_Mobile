Helping Others to Honor Our Maker
1 Do we feel as did the psalmist when he said: “O Jehovah, . . . with you is the source of life”? (Ps. 36:5, 9) How can we in turn help others appreciate and give honor to Jehovah as our Creator? By offering Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? during June. This book is truly outstanding in that it provides solid evidence of God’s existence and clearly shows why evolution cannot be true. It also builds up trust in the Bible as God’s Word. Surely we want everyone to know how creation, not evolution, brings honor to Jehovah God.
2 Here is a simple, direct presentation.
After greeting the householder, display the picture on page 6, and ask:
▪ “How did life get started on this earth? Some say it was all by accident. The Bible gives all the credit to God. What do you think? [Allow for response.] This book provides answers that are in full harmony with the Bible and scientific facts. I’d like you to have it so that you can review all the evidence and decide for yourself.”
3 After introducing yourself, you might say:
▪ “In this modern scientific world, is it practical to believe in creation, or do you think we got here by chance? [Allow for response.] Notice the Bible’s reasoning on this matter. [Read Hebrews 3:4.] Would you not agree that every building has a builder? So, could the universe have come into existence by itself?” Show the illustration on page 114 of the Creation book, and then call attention to the thought expressed in paragraph 2 on page 115. If the householder shows interest and takes the book, tell him that the next time you call you will discuss the question, What is the future of man and the earth?
4 Or after greeting the householder, you could say:
▪ “What do you think our first ancestors looked like? [Allow for response.] Did they look like this ‘ape-man’? [Open to page 83 of the Creation book.] Notice what the Bible states at Acts 17:26. [Read.] So, on what are drawings of ‘ape-men’ based?” Draw attention to the caption under the drawing on page 89. Tell the householder that he can benefit from reading the book and learning the answer to this question.
5 Another approach might be to point to the cover of the “Creation” book and say:
▪ “Today we’re asking our neighbors, Did man get here by evolution or by creation? What do you think? [Allow for response.] Although many highly educated people accept evolution as a fact, other highly educated ones do not believe it. Notice the conclusion drawn by a former astronaut. [Highlight points on pages 122-3.] We must personally examine the evidence to see which we should believe​—evolution or creation.” If the householder accepts the book, raise a question that can be answered on your next call.
6 Do you yearn to help others learn the marvelous truths about our Creator and his loving purpose toward his creation? The Creation book can help you do that. It honors our Grand Creator, the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, by extolling his works and making known his marvelous purpose to sanctify his name and to bless mankind through Christ’s Kingdom.

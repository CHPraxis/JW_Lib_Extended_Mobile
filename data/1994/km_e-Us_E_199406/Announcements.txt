Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June: Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? July: A combination of three 32-page booklets that the congregation may already have in stock. If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they may now have on hand. August: Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, The Government That Will Bring Paradise, and What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It? September: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.
▪ Beginning on October 3, 1994, the book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! will be considered at the Congregation Book Study.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.

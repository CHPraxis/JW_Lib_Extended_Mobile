<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That arresting question is the title of a tract that is distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Last year a resident of Washington, D.C., received this tract and said that he was intrigued. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It is obvious to one who lives in our nation’s capital that the world is indeed coming to an end. Northern Ireland, former Yugoslavia, the former republics of the Soviet Union, all testify to the darkness and strife that plague this world today. Overflowing prisons, new epidemics of tuberculosis and black plague, all prove the point you make in your tract.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The man requested: “Please send me further information regarding your unique point of view, and the free home Bible study that you offer.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses direct people to what the Bible says about mankind’s future. If you would like a copy of the above-​mentioned tract or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

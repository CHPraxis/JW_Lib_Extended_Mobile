<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>CORRESPONDENT IN JAPAN</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“AS A janitorial company, we should be ashamed of ourselves, but it seems it is cleaner when you people do [the cleaning].” The man in charge of the janitorial company for the Fukuoka Dome Stadium, Japan, said this last summer concerning the preparation done by Jehovah’s Witnesses for their “Divine Teaching” District Convention. He was also involved with the Tokyo Dome Stadium the preceding year when the “Light Bearers” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses was held there, and he was deeply impressed. At the end of the conventions, the stadium was cleaner than when it had been rented out. He further said: “The conduct of the children was outstanding. I can only say: ‘Terrific!’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Last year, the “Divine Teaching” District Convention was also held in Takamatsu City. A middle-​aged man who had been observing convention delegates asked them, “Are you Christians?” and then continued: “You had a convention last year too, didn’t you? Where are your children during the convention?” When the delegates answered: “They are listening to talks and opening their own Bibles with their parents,” the man said: “That’s good! I see your people every summer and am always impressed that your children are well behaved.” He then went on to observe that although he hears a lot about the generation gap between parents and children, he can tell from the conduct of the children of Jehovah’s Witnesses that the parent-​child relationship among them is very good.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">An elementary-​school teacher, who attended a district convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses held at Makuhari Messe last year, was astounded to see the attitude of the children at the convention site. At school, where learning should progress by the students’ listening to others talk, she had felt that the children were not willing to listen. However, she saw something different at the convention. “Those children were sitting up straight for long periods of time. And what is more, they were holding their pencils tight in their hands and taking notes, writing characters correctly despite having to write on their laps. The Witness children are different from other children, even at school, in their way of speaking and listening and in their dress and grooming.” She then added: “I think it is because of their daily training, their praising Jehovah, and their families working together toward one end.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Just as the Israelites followed the divine law that said: “Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones . . . , in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn,” Jehovah’s Witnesses today, both old and young, men and women, gather together and receive the same teaching. The above scripture continues, giving the reason: “As they must fear Jehovah your God and take care to carry out all the words of this law.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>.</p>

Drugs, Spiritism, and the Bible
Paul warned first-​century Christians against the “practice of spiritism.” (Galatians 5:20) The Greek word Paul here used, phar·ma·kiʹa, literally means “the use of drugs.” “Since witches and sorcerers used drugs,” explains The Interpreter’s Bible, “the word came to designate witchcraft, enchantment, sorcery, and magic.”
Not surprisingly, drugs play a part in modern-​day spiritism. For example, alcohol and drugs have reportedly been used to induct new members into satanic cults. It has also been said that drugs may be used to make a victim more malleable about performing tasks during the satanic ceremonies. Whatever the case, Peter wrote that the Devil “walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (1 Peter 5:8) The Greek word ka·ta·piʹno, translated “devour,” figuratively means “consume,” or “overwhelm.” Drugs and spiritism do just that. This gives Christians forceful incentive to avoid any type of drug abuse.​—Compare 2 Corinthians 4:4.

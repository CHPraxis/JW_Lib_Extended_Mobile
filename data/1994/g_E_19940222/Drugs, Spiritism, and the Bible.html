<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Paul warned first-​century Christians against the “practice of spiritism.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:20-48:5:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 5:20</a>) The Greek word Paul here used, <em>phar·ma·kiʹa, </em>literally means “the use of drugs.” “Since witches and sorcerers used drugs,” explains <em>The Interpreter’s Bible, </em>“the word came to designate witchcraft, enchantment, sorcery, and magic.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Not surprisingly, drugs play a part in modern-​day spiritism. For example, alcohol and drugs have reportedly been used to induct new members into satanic cults. It has also been said that drugs may be used to make a victim more malleable about performing tasks during the satanic ceremonies. Whatever the case, Peter wrote that the Devil “walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) The Greek word <em>ka·ta·piʹno, </em>translated “devour,” figuratively means “consume,” or “overwhelm.” Drugs and spiritism do just that. This gives Christians forceful incentive to avoid any type of drug abuse.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.</p>

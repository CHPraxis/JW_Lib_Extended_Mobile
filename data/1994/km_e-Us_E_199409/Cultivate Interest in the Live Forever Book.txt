Cultivate Interest in the Live Forever Book
1 When we call at their homes, we usually find that people are engrossed in “the anxieties of this system of things.” (Mark 4:19) We are confronted with the challenge of capturing their interest with a thought-provoking presentation. Initially, most people may have little interest in what we have to say. If we can say something that will touch their lives, we may be able to stir some interest in the Kingdom message. A key to starting conversations is to select appealing talking points from the Live Forever book. What could you say?
2 You might use this approach:
▪ “If you had the power, what distressing problem in our day would you correct? [Allow for response, and if appropriate, agree that many people feel the same way.] Up to this point, world leaders seem to have little success in finding solutions to many perplexing problems of the day. But there is One who can and will bring an end to all the problems afflicting mankind. Please note what is stated at Psalm 145:16. [Read the scripture, and refer to the illustrations on pages 11-13.] Paragraph 14 on page 14 raises the question we just discussed and goes on to ask: ‘But when will this occur?’” Explain that the book will answer that question, and if there is interest, offer the book.
3 Or you could say something like this:
▪ “Perhaps you know the empty feeling that comes with losing a loved one in death. Likely it made you feel sad and very helpless. You may have pondered these questions: [Read questions in paragraph 1 on page 76.] Wouldn’t it be comforting to have the answers to these questions? It may encourage you to know that the Bible holds out a sure hope for those who have died. [Read John 5:28, 29.] This book helps us to understand the condition of the dead and what hope there is for the future.” Briefly refer to chapters 8 and 20. If there seems to be interest, give the householder an opportunity to examine the book.
4 There is a good possibility that you will encounter opportunities to witness informally. If so, you might say in your own words something like this:
▪ “The world is full of problems these days, and no doubt you have your share of them. Sad to say, it seems that the innocent ones suffer the most. Do you think God will ever put an end to all suffering? [Allow for response.] Let me point out what God promises to do for those who serve him. [Read Psalm 37:40 and then open the Live Forever book to page 99.] This book explains why God has permitted wickedness and how he will bring it to an end.”
5 If you are a younger publisher, you could use a presentation based on the illustrations found on pages 156-8. You might start by asking:
▪ “Would you like to live in a world like this? [Allow for response.] Each one of these beautiful pictures is based on a promise stated in God’s Word, the Bible. [Point to Scripture references.] This book can help you learn more about God’s promise to make the whole earth into a paradise. It contains lifesaving information and is well worth the time it takes to read it.”​—John 17:3.
6 When offering the book, be mindful of the need to make your listeners aware of their opportunity to contribute toward the worldwide work.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">YES, the time is almost upon us for the 1994 district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses. From June 1994 until January 1995, the three-day convention program will be heard in hundreds of cities around the world​—first in North America, then in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, Central and South America, Africa, Australia, and the isles of the sea.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What a thought-provoking theme​—“Godly Fear”! This is not the sick dread of someone whose life is in danger but the fear of God, a fear that gives peace of mind and joy. The Bible proverb says: “The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:4-20:22:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:4</a>) How can fearing God result in “riches and glory and life”? That will become evident as the convention theme is developed during three days filled with discourses, discussions, demonstrations, and a drama.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The apostle Paul wrote that we should not ‘forsake the gathering of ourselves together.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:25</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses take that seriously, meeting three times a week for congregation study and worship. However, the annual district convention is special. They look forward to it with anticipation and talk about it for months afterward. We warmly invite you, whatever your religion, to join them at their convention and enjoy warm Christian fellowship and vital spiritual information. A member of the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to tell you where and when the convention nearest to you will be held.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ONE of Jehovah’s Witnesses who works at Italy’s Milan Linate Airport took the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>to work with him. A number of his colleagues said that they would like to have a personal copy of this publication on the life of Jesus Christ. A few days later, as the Witness was delivering the requested books, one of his workmates told him that employees at several airlines said they would also like to have the book. So the Witness asked her to make a list of all those who wanted it. Some days later the list was given to him.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The number of books requested was not immediately available, but two weeks later the Witness had obtained them. He and a fellow Witness visited everyone on the list, and altogether 461 books were delivered! As they were being distributed, arrangements were made for 13 persons to be visited by Witnesses living nearby to start home Bible studies with them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you would like to receive a copy of this 448-​page hardcover book or to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

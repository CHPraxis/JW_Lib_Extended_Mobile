FIELD MINISTRY
Long in advance, Jehovah God, in his Word the Bible, described the present world situation, pointing out its cause and the cure. It is concerning this God of true prophecy and his purposes that Jehovah’s witnesses speak. During November they will continue to do so, offering to all persons the faith-inspiring new book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” with a booklet, for 50c.
1966 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR
The 1966 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses will be available after November 23, 1965. Each year this annual report of the Watchtower Society’s president is eagerly awaited by Jehovah’s witnesses. It contains information about the progress of the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses world wide, with a statistical report of this activity tabulated by countries. The field experiences of these preachers of the good news are stimulating and enlightening. Send for your copy of the Yearbook. It is 50c. Send also for the 1966 calendar. It is 25c.

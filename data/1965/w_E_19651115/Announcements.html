<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Long in advance, Jehovah God, in his Word the Bible, described the present world situation, pointing out its cause and the cure. It is concerning this God of true prophecy and his purposes that Jehovah’s witnesses speak. During November they will continue to do so, offering to all persons the faith-inspiring new book <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </em>with a booklet, for 50c.</p>

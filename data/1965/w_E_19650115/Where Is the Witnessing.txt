Where Is the Witnessing?
The publication Lutheran Witness of March 17, 1964, page 15, says: “Research indicates . . . that it takes 27 years for the average member of our church body to help bring another person to Christ and membership in his Church. . . . During 1962, according to official statistics, 1741 of the 5500 parishes affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod did not gain a single adult by confirmation or confession of faith.”
Other churches in Christendom, if they did the necessary research, undoubtedly would come up with a similar or even higher figure than the twenty-seven years required for a member to bring a new person to his church. True Christians, Jesus Christ plainly indicated, would be known by their regular, busy Kingdom witnessing to people of all the nations.—Matt. 24:14.

Smoking Synod
● Reported the New Zealand Herald of April 14, 1964: “The president of the 36th general synod of the Anglican Church, the Primate and Archbishop of New Zealand, . . . interrupted the morning session yesterday to allow the assembly to smoke. ‘I understand,’ he said, ‘that some of our weaker brethren cannot go through a full morning’s session without a smoke.’ The archbishop then lit a cigarette. He was accompanied by a large number of those present.”

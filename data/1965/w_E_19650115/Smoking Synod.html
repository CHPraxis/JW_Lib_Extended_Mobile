<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Reported the New Zealand <em>Herald </em>of April 14, 1964: “The president of the 36th general synod of the Anglican Church, the Primate and Archbishop of New Zealand, . . . interrupted the morning session yesterday to allow the assembly to smoke. ‘I understand,’ he said, ‘that some of our weaker brethren cannot go through a full morning’s session without a smoke.’ The archbishop then lit a cigarette.

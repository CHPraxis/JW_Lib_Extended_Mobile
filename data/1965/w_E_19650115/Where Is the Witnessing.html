<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The publication <em>Lutheran Witness </em>of March 17, 1964, page 15, says: “Research indicates . . . that it takes 27 years for the average member of our church body to help bring another person to Christ and membership in his Church. . . . During 1962, according to official statistics, 1741 of the 5500 parishes affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod did not gain a single adult by confirmation or confession of faith.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Other churches in Christendom, if they did the necessary research, undoubtedly would come up with a similar or even higher figure than the twenty-seven years required for a member to bring a new person to his church. True Christians, Jesus Christ plainly indicated, would be known by their regular, busy Kingdom witnessing to people of all the nations.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God has lovingly provided a “house of prayer” for all the peoples. It is no expression of interfaith, but is a provision that Jehovah has made for the benefit of persons out of all nations who want to worship him in spirit and in truth. The Watchtower magazine has aided tens of thousands to come to God’s house of prayer. Throughout April, Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three Bible study booklets, on a contribution of $1.

MEMORIAL
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me,” said Jesus Christ as he instituted the memorial of his death. This year the date to observe this memorial falls on Friday, April 16, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. After a Bible discourse, the Memorial emblems, the bread and wine, will be passed, separately, after Jehovah’s blessing has been asked upon each. All persons who love Jehovah God and appreciate his provision for life through Christ are invited and encouraged to attend. If you do not know where the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses is located, write the publishers of this magazine for information.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Among the churches of Christendom at least two things are prominently lacking—an interest in the spiritual welfare of the people and a successful effort to impart to their members a knowledge of the Scriptures. Note what clergyman G. Paul Musselman said about this in <em>The Saturday Evening Post </em>of November 18, 1961: “Many urban dwellers may feel that they can get along without the Church because they see it preoccupied with its own organizational affairs instead of reaching out to help people. Certainly the churchgoer’s ignorance of scriptural teachings must seem less than inspiring to the nonchurchgoer. In a survey of officers in churches, it was found that many of the leaders were not sure, for example, whether the Sermon on the Mount was in the Old or the New Testament.”</p>

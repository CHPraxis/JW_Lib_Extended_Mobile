<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True followers of Jesus Christ maintain unity of faith and work by cooperating closely with one another and with Jehovah’s visible organization, which is directing the worldwide preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. During August this unity will be manifest as they call at the homes of people everywhere to share the faith-inspiring truths contained in God’s Word. As an aid to interested persons, they will offer Bible study publications, on a small contribution.</p>

How are you directly involved? What protection is available? Read the timely and absorbing 704-page hardbound book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>Send only 75c.</p>

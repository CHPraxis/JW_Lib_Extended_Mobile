<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Faithfulness and loyalty are qualities that all servants of Jehovah God need. As they carry on their ministry, preaching God’s Word, they find that they are called on to demonstrate these qualities every day. This will continue to be true during July as Jehovah’s witnesses call on people everywhere to point out from the Bible the dangers of false religion and the blessings of God’s kingdom. To aid truth seekers, they will offer Bible-study publications on a nominal contribution.</p>

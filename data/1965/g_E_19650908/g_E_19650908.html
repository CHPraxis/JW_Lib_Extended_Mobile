<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>DO YOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WANT TO?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">D</span><span class="font1">O YOU? There are certain things we are supposed to do whether we want to do them or not, but there are also other things the doing of which is optional with us. In either case, however, success most likely will depend upon whether we </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really </span><span class="font1">want to or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An example of this is the successful laying of the first cable between Europe and the United States. It was more than a century ago, in 1854, that an American, Cyrus Field, set his heart on the laying of such a transatlantic cable. It was no small undertaking, the laying of a cable 1,950 miles long and at an average depth of 10,000 feet; few thought it possible. But Field worked at it tirelessly, enlisting the support of private enterprise, public opinion anc’ the governments of Great Britain and the United States. After twelve years of effort and four very costly and unsuccessful attempts, success finally crowned the efforts of those whom he had persuaded to undertake the project. He gained a lasting reputation for patience. He really wanted to see that cable laid and so was not easily discouraged or diverted therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How often we have wishes, desires, aspirations, ideals; how often we want to have this skill or that possession; or we may want to break a bad habit, but so often we fail to realize our objective because we do not really want to! A man may see his friend enjoying some hobby, such as photography, or a woman may see the dresses that her friends have made, and these may wish they could do the same, but that is as far as they go. If they </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> wanted to, they could develop these skills and reap their rewards, bringing pleasure to themselves as well as to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Or it may be the skill of touch-typing, being able to use all one’s fingers on the typewriter without looking at the keys, making possible both speed and accuracy. Many persons who use the “hunt-and-peck” system fondly want to be able to do that, but do they </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> want to? If so, they will take the time and effort to make this skill their own, even as millions of others have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then again, a young man, or a man not so young, may feel attracted toward a charming creature of the opposite sex and may want to have her as his wife. But merely wanting her will not be enough, nor even the making of a few timid advances. The intended may show no interest at first; she may at first not be interested. But if he really wants to have her company he will remember that “faint heart never won fair lady,” and so will call into play ardor, imagination and perseverance, remembering how many years the Hebrew patriarch Jacob served for his beloved Rachel!—Gen. 29:17-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At times the thing that is wanted is the breaking of a bad habit, such as cigarette smoking. A person may feel distressed by all he reads about the harm that cigarette smoking can do to one's health, not to say anything about its being a costly and unclean habit; but does he </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> want to break it? If he really does, he can and he will. Then he will not be like those “chain smokers” who die in their fifties when they might well have lived on into their seventies. Rather, he will make a firm resolve and then act upon it Ite will admit to himself that, while it may not be easy, it certainly is not impossible. Have not many, many thousands broken this habit? They have and they have found it was worth while doing so, although not easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This searching question may also be applied to trying to live up to one’s principles, ideals, convictions. Do you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really </span><span class="font1">want to keep honest, upright, chaste? Or have you left some loopholes? If you have left some loopholes, then sooner or later a strong temptation will cause you to yield, making your close friends and relatives wonder how you could have made such a serious mistake. No doubt the sad plight of many an unwed mother is not so much the result of a girl wanting to do wrong as it is of her not really wanting, or not wanting strongly enough, to do what is right. The Bible helps us in this respect, for it inculcates not only the loving of what is right but the hating of what is bad. If we really want to do what is right, we will hate what is bad.—Ps. 45:7; Prov. 8:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same principle also applies to the subject of prayer. If a Christian really wants his prayers answered, then, for one thing, he will persevere in prayer. He will also exercise faith that God will answer his prayers, for that also is vital. And since the Bible tells us that faith without works is dead, he will need to work at what he prays for, since it is a true saying that God does not do something for us that we can do for ourselves; he will do his part, but the one praying must also do his part. —Luke 18:1-8; Jas. 1:5-7; 2:24, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All this applies with peculiar force to the Christian ministry. A minister may wish he had more knowledge so as to be able to answer the many questions that are continually being put to him. He may wish he could give fine comments at study meetings or to give informative, coherent and persuasive Bible lectures. But does he </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> want to be able to do these things? If so, he will do what others have done to acquire these abilities; he will conscientiously apply himself to achieving these qualities, heeding the counsel that the Christian apostle Paul gave his friend Timothy: “Continue applying yourself . . . Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them . . . Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these, things.”—1 Tim. 4:13, 15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We all are limited when it comes to time, energy and means. As the saying goes, “It is never this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font1"> that but this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or </span><span class="font1">that!” The question is, Do you really want to acquire that skill, win that treasure, break that bad habit, live according to your principles? If you do, you must make room for it. But you must </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> want to!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark15"></a>WHERE riAH A °<sup>F</sup></span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>BE FOUND ?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">T</span><span class="font1">HE perils of living in this twentieth century, made so clearly evident by daily newspaper reports, magnify the need to find something that can give a sense of security. A child finds it in the strong arms of his father, but where can an adult find it? When he is confronted with distressing events that are beyond his control, where can he turn for the sense of security that is so necessary to carry him through?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Over 3,000 years ago a man that was confronted with seemingly insurmountable difficulties on more than one occasion revealed where he found the sense of security that enabled him to endure. Because of it he did not collapse in fear or compromise his integrity. That man was an Israelite king who was noted for being a composer of songs. One song in particular reveals the source of his sense of security and how he felt, because of it, when faced with trying circumstances. The stimulating words of that song are still in existence and can be found in a large book of songs contained in the Holy Bible. It is the twenty-third of 150 songs that the Bible has preserved for us in the book entitled Psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the opening verse, David identifies the basis for his sense of security as being man’s heavenly Creator, the source of the energy that forms the fundamental building blocks of the visible universe. The proper name of the universe’s Creator is given many times in the original language in which Psalms was written, and it is commonly translated into English as Jehovah. In the first verse of Psalm 23, David likens Jehovah to a shepherd, saying: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing,” Dwell on this sentence a moment and sense the soothing calm that it brings one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having been a shepherd, David was intimately acquainted with the relationship of a shepherd to a flock of sheep. A shepherd is keenly interested in the welfare of his sheep and stays close to them, giving them loving care. He leads them to places where he knows there is good grass to eat and water to drink. Under his loving care they lack nothing, for he provides for all their needs. The nation of Israel was like a flock of sheep over which Jehovah acted as a loving Shepherd. While they were wandering in the wilderness, he provided for them, seeing to it that they did not lack for food, water and other necessities of life.—Ps. 80:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pointing out how Jehovah cares for his people, David sang in another song: “Fear Jehovah, you holy ones of his, for there is no lack tcf those fearing him.” (Ps. 34: 9) In still another song, David observed: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” (Ps. 37:25) Those who are God’s people today and who look to him as their Shepherd have a sense of security that they will lack nothing that is necessary for their basic needs. Jesus Christ pointed this out when he said to his faithful followers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Never bg anxious and say, 'What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?* or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">added to you.” (Matt 6:31-33) When </span><span class="font1">persons who serve God faithfully as David did put forth a reasonable effort to obtain the necessities of life, Jehovah blesses those efforts, and they go in want for none of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Continuing with the viewpoint of sheep under the care of a loving shepherd, David says in verse two of Psalm 23: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.” Here we sense contentment, satisfaction, joy. During the heat of the day, shepherds in Bible times brought their sheep to shaded watering places where the sheep could drink and rest. In a spiritual sense, God does this with his people. He provides them with refreshing waters of truth and shields them from the scorching heat of his fiery judgments that come upon those who have refused the opportunities given them to know God as part of his flock of obedient people.—2 Thess. 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the book of Revelation, those who make up the great crowd of persons serving Jehovah today are promised that they will not hunger or thirst for spiritual nourishment. Divine chastisement will not beat down upon them like a hot midday sun, but they will be shaded from the scorching heat of God’s fiery judgments. Jehovah’s shepherd Son, Jesus Christ, who has been given the responsibility of caring for Jehovah’s flock, will &quot;shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life.” (Rev. 7:16,17) This prophetic promise is well illustrated by David’s inspired comparison of Jehovah’s people with sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because Jehovah, the Great Shepherd, provides his people with life-giving waters of truth and energy-giving spiritual food, their souls are refreshed, as promised in verse three of Psalm 23: &quot;My soul he refreshes. He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake.” Is it not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">refreshment that we long for? Refreshment</span><span class="font1"> from woes and cares that burden the soul. David felt this refreshment. When opposition from enemies of Jehovah’s people or unpleasant events in one’s life cause discouragement, the upbuilding counsel and faith-inspiring expressions in God’s Word of truth refresh one, giving him strength to continue walking the way of integrity to God. The tracks of righteousness are in a narrow road of obedience to God, with its boundaries set by God’s laws. As long as a servant of Jehovah God stays within those boundaries he walks a way of righteousness that leads to eternal life for him. Jesus Christ spoke of this road when he said: “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.”—Matt 7:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By means of his inspired Word and his devoted organization of faithful servants on earth Jehovah leads his people in the tracks of righteousness. Continually they are given counsel on proper moral conduct so they might not succumb to sexual immorality and the dishonest practices of the world. They are urged to avoid bad associations so they will not be drawn away from the tracks of righteousness. Close association with Jehovah’s clean organization is constantly emphasized. Thus Jehovah guides his people along the road of righteousness, which ultimately leads to their salvation and the gift of life. Their soul he refreshes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because of their complete trust in Jehovah, his servants have a satisfying sense of security even when faced with dangerous circumstances that threaten their freedom and put their lives in danger* Fanatical persecution by religious enemies, the hatred of political governments and popular disapproval do not cause Jehovah’s people to become fearful and stop serving the true God, Comparing their sense of security in the face of danger with the secure feeling sheep can have when their shepherd is leading them through dangerous terrain where wild beasts may be lurking, David said in verse four of Psalm 23: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” “You are with me” is the assurance that each of us wants, that God is with us, that he cares for us. (1 Pet. 5:7) With his staff a shepherd could beat off predatory animals and snakes that threatened the sheep. In the case of the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God, the use of his weapons of denunciation against enemies that seek to destroy his people are a comfort to them, giving them a sense of security,—Isa. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With verse five of Psalm 23, David shifts from the illustration of sheep under the care of a shepherd to an illustration of a generous host. For Jehovah’s people, the host that provides a sumptuous banquet for them in the midst of their enemies is Jehovah. David sang about this: “You arrange before me a table in front of those showing hostility to me. With oil you have greased my head; my cup is well filled.” The well-ladened table of nourishing foods that Jehovah provides for his people is a bountiful banquet of spiritual food. Although they live among enemies who are hostile toward them, they are spiritually well fed. This Jehovah foretold through the prophet Isaiah, saying: “Look! My own servants will eat, but you yourselves will go hungry. Look! My own servants will drink, but you yourselves will go thirsty.”—Isa. 65:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the ways a host could manifest his hospitality was to put perfumed oil on the head of a guest. This is indicated from what Jesus said when he was received into the home of a Pharisee by the name of Simon. He pointed out how Simon was a neglectful host, failing to give him water for his feet, a kiss of welcome and perfumed oil for his head. (Luke 7:44-46) Jehovah does not fail to do this for the people to whom he gives a banquet of spiritual food. As foretold through the prophet Isaiah, he gives them the “oil of exultation instead of mourning.”—Isa. 61:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At a sumptuous feast in ancient times, such as David was using for an illustration, good wine was served. This was done at the marriage feast of Cana, where Jesus performed his first miracle by replenishing the supply pf wine by changing water to wine. (John 2:1-10) We are told at Psalm 104:15 that God provides wine to make “the heart of mortal man rejoice.&quot; In the spiritual banquet of good things that Jehovah provides so generously for his people he includes a well-filled cup of joy, symbolized by the banquet cup of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the strong sense of security that comes from being able to trust in Jehovah, the Creator of the universe, Jehovah’s dedicated people are able to face the trials and tribulations of this age courageously. Because of his blessings, they can say as David did in the sixth and final verse of Psalm 23: &quot;Surely goodness and loving-kindness themselves will pursue me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah to the length of days.” Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness will pursue his people as long as they continue to walk in the steps of righteousness. They will always be the objects of his blessings and loving care. Thus it is in Jehovah God that a real sense of security can be found in this perilous age.</span></p>

Nations are spending billions of dollars to put a man on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">moon,</span><span class="font1"> yet many humans on earth do not have a decent place to live that affords privacy and protection from the elements. Cities in many places are so crowded that millions of people are forced to live in slums that are sometimes unfit habitations for lower animals. Others, who are unable even to afford these accommodations, make their home on sidewalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Describing this paradox of the twentieth century, housing expert Charles Abrams writes: “Housing progress lags far behind industrial progress in every part of the world. The technical genius that broke the secrets of speed, sound, space, and light still cannot build a house cheap enough for the rank and file. While a Soviet cosmonaut can orbit the worlfl, the state that launched him cannot establish a good housing program on the ground. A negro laborer’s family in New York and a squatter in Caracas may both have television sets, but neither can afford a decent house.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Factors Responsible</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two factors in particular are responsible for this shortage of decent housing, described by some as one of man's greatest social problems. First is the present-day population explosion. For the first eighteen hundred years of the Common Era the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">world’s population remained practically stable, the death rate nearly balancing the birth rate. But then earth’s population leaped ahead, from about two billion in 1930 to three billion by the end of 1960. Presently the rate of growth is estimated at over 175,000 persons a day, or about eighty million annually. Certainly an enormous number of persons to provide with adequate housing each year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A second major factor that is responsible for the housing problem is the tremendous migration to cities. With the coming of industrialization during the nineteenth century, the cities of Europe and America experienced such a migration, forcing many persons to sleep in the streets because of lack of accommodations. In recent years the industrial revolution has reached Africa, Asia and Latin America and, according to one estimate, 200 million people are expected to move into the cities of these continents between 1960 and 1970. Where to put them all presents a critical problem.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>When People Move to Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">People who live in rural communities generally have little difficulty with housing. Land is plentiful and neighbors work to help one another build their own homes. But when people move to crowded cities to obtain employment in industry, housing is not so easily obtained. A report made a few years ago by a United Nations Mission regarding the housing situation in Ghana is interesting in this connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Mission found that 80 percent of the houses in that African country were built by their occupants. Everyone pitched in to help, including the women, who did such work as plastering the walls and finishing the floors. Building was of particular excellence wherever traditions were undisturbed, and the builders had to live up to the quality standards established by their ancestors. So in most rural communities housing was not found to be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the other hand, it was observed that self-help and cooperation became steadily less common in the larger population centers. In the cities there was specialization in the building enterprise, and housebuilding had become involved with the money economy. Land was expensive, and even if it could be afforded people with secular employment generally did not have enough free time to do any building themselves. So, in order to get a house constructed, it was necessary to leave the work to specialists. Since few could afford this, they were forced either to sleep in the streets or to And a place in crowded slums. As a result, in Accra, Ghana’s capital city, occupancy per single house in 1960 was 19.3 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accommodating increasing urban populations is a gigantic problem faced by developing nations the world over. In his recent book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Struggle for Shelter</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">an Urbanising World,</span><span class="font1"> Charles Abrams commented on industrialization’s effect on housing, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The anomaly is that the less industrialized the country, the less apt it is to have a housing problem. The momei t it begins to develop industrially, its housing problem burgeons. The more it develops industrially, the more stubborn the problem becomes. In a primitive village, the housing problem is not critical. The moment the family moves from village to city, its members surrender the home that is usually their own, as well as the more ample space on which it stands, the freedom from noise, smoke, traffic, and danger, the proximity to nature, and their place in community life. What they get in the impersonal city, whatever the other compensations may be, is a crowded slum and sometimes not even that.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Where the Problem Is Severest</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is in the more recently industrialized countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America that the housing problem is severest. The rate of urban growth in Asia is 400 percent higher than in Western cities, and the migration is only beginning. However, already the inundation of people has resulted in almost unbelievable conditions of overcrowding. In Calcutta, India, for instance, the population has swelled so quickly that some 600,000 persons, or more than 10 percent of the population, are forced to sleep in the streets. Street sleeping is common in many countries.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the most crowded place in the world is Hong Kong. In some places there the population density reaches about 2,000 persons per acre, and people live without a water supply or any organized system of refuse disposal. If that density of population were applied throughout New York City, all the 300 million people living in Africa or all the inhabitants of North America could be housed within New York’s city limits. Imagine the tremendous problem of accommodating so many persons in such cramped quarters!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lagos, Nigeria, the capital of Africa’s most populous country, also exemplifies the problems created by an exploding urban population. One </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sector of the city</span><span class="font1"> increased from 36,000 people in 1952 to 277,000 in 1962, and now as many as eighty persons are forced to share one small house. Sanitation is one of the major problems. Human excrement is deposited daily in some 13,000 night-soil buckets, and is collected and dumped into the lagoon. The problem is reflected in the fact that about 85 percent of the schoolchildren in Lagos are infected with either roundworm or hookworm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Tokyo, Japan, the world’s largest city, a recent survey by the municipal authorities revealed that the housing shortage was regarded as the greatest grievance citizens had against the government. There the average resident has less space in which to live than before the second world war. Just recently the press reported an instance of where a taxicab driver was arrested by the police for making love to his wife in the public plaza of the Imperial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palace. But when the man pleaded that he </span><span class="font1">simply could not perform his husbandly duties at home, where their family of six was crowded together into a room nine feet by nine feet, he wets given a sympathetic release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A study made by the United Nations indicates </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the enormity of the housing problem.</span><span class="font1"> It was estimated a few years ago that more than one billion persons in Africa, Asia and Latin America, or roughly half of the population of those continents, are either homeless or live under unsafe or grossly overcrowded housing conditions. To cope with the situation, one housing expert said, the nations of these continents need to build a minimum of 24 million dwellings a year, or about ten dwellings annually per 1,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Housing in Europe and the US.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wartime bombings, the population explosion and massive movements of people to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the cities have created a critical housing </span><span class="font1">problem in Europe also. Reporting on the situation, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> magazine of July 10, 1964, observed: “A space race is on in Western Europe, but the goal is not some distant planet: it is a down-to-earth place to live. . . . Rentals have soared, and the price of private houses has shot out of reach for millions of people. . . . Monthly rent for a three-room apartment in a lower-middleclass district averages $65 in Dusseldorf, $70 in Brussels and a skyscraping $180 in Paris, Europe’s toughest town for housing. In Italy’s cities, unskilled workers have a hard time finding one-room flats for $50, which represents one-half of their monthly income.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Across the channel in England proper housing is at least as difficult to obtain. ‘Tn London alone, seven families each day become officially homeless, and the rate is rising,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> magazine of December 1, 1961, reported. According to an eighteen</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">month investigation completed earlier this </span><span class="font1">year, there are 1,500 “known homeless families” in Greater London, and an additional 190,000 families in urgent need of better housing. It was also reported that one out of every five households is without a bath, and that less than half have the private use of hot and cold water, bath, toilet, sink and stove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The United States, often considered the most prosperous nation in the world, has a housing problem too. In many of her principal cities millions of persons live in slums that, in some cases, rival the inhospitable living conditions found in cities of less </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prosperous</span><span class="font1"> countries. Not long ago housing expert C. F. Palmer told a class at Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration: “Throughout America more people live in slums than on farms.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font1"> 1956 Edition, Volume 14, page 448, noted: “The often repeated statement that ‘one third of the nation is improperly housed’ is no mere epigram; it is a fact witnessed by repeated investigation and statistics.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>What Is Being Done</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although faced with a gigantic task, many countries are making concerted efforts to relieve their housing shortage. Japan is one example. Already since World War II about 9,150,000 housing units have been constructed, 787,000 in one recent year. The rallying cry of Premier Eisaku Sato’s government has become “a home for every family” by 1970. However, the exorbitant price of land is an obstacle. In central Tokyo it sells for as much as $18,000,000 an acre, twice the top price for land in the choicest sections of New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Progress has also been made in Russia, where the policy aim is to provide houses for as many people as possible in the shortest time possible. From 1957 to 1962 about 12 million dwellings were completed in towns and workers’ settlements and 3.8 million in rural districts. In recent years Russia has regularly led the world in house production; in 1960 its output of 14 dwellings per 1,000 inhabitants far surpassed the runner-up nation, West Germany, which produced 10.5 houses per 1,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Netherlands, too, has made real efforts toward providing adequate housing. In 1964 housing formed the third-largest item in the budget, and a goal of 90,000 dwellings was set. France is another nation making strides toward meeting her housing needs. Since World War II she has constructed over 3 million dwellings, and in 1963 increased production nicely to 328,000. Italy also is moving ahead in house production, from 313,000 in 1962 to 360,000 in 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great Britain is building more houses than ever before, 420,000 being under construction by the middle of 1964, and yet the demand for housing there is still great. In the United States about a million and </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">half new homes are started each year. However, some builders argue that priority is given to requests for higher-priced dwellings. They claim that not nearly enough effort has been made to provide housing for persons in the lower income brackets. It is true that in some cities great strides have been made in replacing slums with fine housing developments, but, unfortunately, almost as quickly, other areas deteriorate into slums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In spite of efforts made and progress attained, housing problems throughout the world remain acute. Progress in some areas is outweighed by deteriorating situations in other parts of the world. While unprecedented strides in technology have been made in the past twenty years, the housing situation, viewed from an international standpoint, has become worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Clearly, to satisfy even this basic need of man, it is necessary to look beyond the stop-gap proposals of human agencies. Godfearing persons can take comfort in the promise that soon, in God’s new system of things, everyone will have what is necessary to make them happy. The Bible promise is: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.” Housing problems will then be a thing of the past.—Isa. 65:21, 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">so instead of taking a chance on dispensing the wrong drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chemical, Generic and Trade Names </span><span class="font1">Prescriptions can legally be written in a variety of different ways. They can call for either the chemical name, the generic name or the trade name of a drug. Every drug produced has what is called its</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C</span><span class="font1">AUTION: Federal Law Prohibits Dispensing Without a Prescription! These words, called the Rx legend, appear on many drugs commonly used in modern medical practice and require the pharmacist to exercise great care in the filling and refilling of your prescription. Have you often wondered why it is that you can buy some drugs without a prescription, while, with many, you must present a properly signed prescription? How can the pharmacist read that prescription that may not seem clear to you? What do those strange symbols mean? How can you save money on prescription drugs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is an old joke that only a druggist can read a doctor’s writing. In many cases this is the truth. Like all of us, doctors may write illegibly when they are in a hurry— and in today’s busy world they are often in a hurry. Generally speaking, the druggist becomes familiar with both the doctor’s handwriting and the drugs that he commonly prescribes, so that it is not usually a problem for the pharmacist to know what the particular physician wants. It is not uncommon, however, for the pharmacist to telephone the doctor to check on the matter, and it is a wise man who does chemical name. It is a name given to it to describe its chemical structure, and a chemist can construct the drug by following rules of nomenclature when he reads this name. When a new drug is produced it is also given another name. This is a shorter name and usually cannot be used to determine its chemical structure. This is called its generic name, and in contrast to the chemical name, this one is often used in prescription writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chemical and the generic names are always constant; however, each company that produces a drug has the right to give its product its own trade name. Therefore any drug that is manufactured by different companies can have a variety of trade names although they are referring to the same drug. This trade name is the one that becomes the most popular, both because it usually is shorter and easier to remember and because the manufacturer’s representative, who often visits the doctor, tries to get the doctor to prescribe his product. The doctor can write his prescription by any of these different names that he chooses, but usually he chooses the trade name, although he can, and often does, write the generic name, which can be an advantage to the patient in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the doctor calls for a drug under its trade name, it has been held illegal for the pharmacist to fill that prescription with any other product of any other company, although he may have the same drug under a different name. Naturally the manufacturer wants to protect his product and, after spending millions of dollars in advertising and promotion, he does not want the druggist to substitute another company’s product. On the other hand, this practice requires the druggist to stock a variety of different products when he would prefer to stock fewer. Naturally this larger investment requires him to charge more for the prescriptions that he fills, and the ultimate cost is carried by you, the customer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This price dilemma has become so serious in the United States that it has caused a Congressional investigation of drug prices, that is, the prices that manufacturers place on their drugs. However, it should be borne in mind that from 40 to 50 percent of the retail price to the customer can be the markup that the retail druggist puts on the prescription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One suggested solution is that the doctor write the generic name of the drug, allowing the druggist to use any company’s product. It should be stated that, to their credit, many doctors do use the generic names in their prescriptions. This often results in a saving of money for the customer. How is this? It is because not all drug manufacturers charge the same prices. Some companies do little or no research; moreover, they may not do much advertising of their products. As a result, they can offer the druggist a product at a cheaper price than can the drug manufacturers who have large expenses in developing and marketing a new drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the druggist usually bases his price to the customer on the cost of the drug, it can result in a cheaper cost for that prescription. A few years ago </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Medical Letter</span><span class="font1"> purchased samples of a drug called “prednisone” from twenty-nine different pharmaceutical companies. The tablets were tested to see whether a doctor could safely prescribe by generic name. The conclusion: &quot;The risk involved in prescribing prednisone by generic name appears to be small. Particularly where the high cost of the ‘name’ brand offers a serious burden to the patient, generic-name prescribing would appear to be in order.” The saving, it added, can amount “to many dollars on each hundred tablets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Anyone who is taking drugs over a long period of time would do well to ask the doctor to write the prescription with the generic name.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>What It Says</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How is it that the druggist can read that prescription in the first place? Contrary to popular opinion, most prescriptions are not written in Latin, at least not in the United States. The name of the drug is written either by the generic or by the trade name. The part of the prescription that comes after the name of the drug can be written in many different ways and tells the quantity of the drug being prescribed. For example, if the product comes in capsule form it may be written: caps. 24 or caps, xxiv, both of which mean 24 capsules, the latter being in Roman numerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The part of the prescription called the signature, and abbreviated as S. or Sig., gives the directions for taking the medicine. Here the doctor may use a shorthand method of writing, partially derived from Latin. As an example: caps, i, t.i.d. means to “take one capsule three times a day,” while q.i.d. means “four times a day.” Tabs, ii, h.s. becomes “take two tablets at bedtime” and a.c. means “before meals,” while p.c. means “after meals.” Therefore, the prescription’s directions written: sig. tabs, i, q.i.d., p.c. and h.s. comes out on the label: “Take one tablet four times a day, after meals and at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bedtime.” Often </span><span class="font1">the doctor will tell the druggist the number of times the prescription may be refilled by noting: “May be refilled 3X,” meaning three times.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Laws Vary by State and Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United States federal law requires a prescription for certain drugs. Almost all countries have similar laws regulating the sale of drugs, which laws may be more strict or more lenient. Then, too, within the United States, each state has the power to tighten the regulations governing the sale of drugs, which causes a great variety of drug laws in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Federal law does not say who may or who may not write a prescription, nor who may or who may not dispense a drug. It merely says that a prescription must be written by a “practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.” This allows the individual states to determine who may lawfully write a prescription and also who may legally fill the prescription. Osteopathic physicians and medical doctors are usually allowed to write prescriptions in any state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United States federal law carries a heavy penalty for those who violate its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prescription</span><span class="font1"> regulations. Under the law, any person who is found guilty of selling Rx legend drugs (those included under the law as ones that may be sold only on a prescription basis) without a prescription, or refilling a prescription without the authorization of the physician, can receive a penalty of a $1,000 fine and one year in prison for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">each separate offense (each sale </span><span class="font1">is considered a separate offense). If a person is convicted a second time, he can be fined $10,000 and be given three years’ imprisonment for each separate offense. You can readily see why your neighborhood druggist requires you to present your prescription before he will sell you the drug you may want. Those who make </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font1"> a practice to sell Rx legend drugs to friends without a prescription are playing with the possibility of a very heavy penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each country, of course, has its own laws, and even though a drug carries an Rx legend on the bottle: Caution: Federal Law Prohibits Dispensing Without a Prescription, this can easily be ignored in those countries that have different laws, and often it is. In many South and Central American countries quite a number of drugs are used that are manufactured in the United States, and it is not uncommon for people to buy a drug that would be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prohibited to them in</span><span class="font1"> the United States unless they had a prescription. In Costa Rica, for example, almost any Rx legend drug can be purchased by merely asking for the drug and paying the price. Of course, Costa Rica has its own pharmacy laws, and those of the United States do not apply.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Copies of Prescriptions and Refills</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes a person may wonder if he can obtain a copy of his prescription. Strictly speaking, the prescription is the property of the customer. He paid the doctor for writing it and it is his personal property. However, United States law requires that the pharmacist keep the prescription on file for at least five years. Therefore it cannot be returned to its owner, and if he wants a record, he must get a copy. According to the federal government, there is no objection to the customer’s receiving a copy of his prescription. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">However, the government’s</span><span class="font1"> view is that it is, of course, merely a copy and has no value for obtaining a refill. The pharmacist has the responsibility to mark it clearly as a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you need more of a prescription drug, it is common for the pharmacist to telephone your doctor while you are waiting and find out whether you should still be taking the medicine. Since, according to law, an oral prescription received over the telephone is a valid prescription, the pharmacist is, in effect, receiving a new prescription and is then legally filling it for you. Therefore, if you are planning a trip away from the area of your doctor and it would not be practical for a druggist to telephone your doctor, it would be the course of wisdom to carry your medicine with you, enough to supply you for your entire time away from home. Or you may carry a few extra legal prescriptions with you, which will usually be cheerfully supplied by your doctor if he understands why you want them. Some drugs cannot legally be prescribed over the telephone, however, and this involves those that are commonly called “narcotics.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Narcotics are drugs such as morphine or codeine. They are usually used for the relief of pain but have the serious disadvantage that they produce addiction if used over a period of time. Because of this, the United States government regulates their sale. These drugs can be dispensed only on receipt of a signed prescription, and the prescription may not legally be refilled at any time. Many pharmacists will not even give a copy of such a prescription. The patient can get the drug again only by getting another prescription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are many types of prescriptions, however, that can be refilled almost at will. Often a doctor will write on a prescription the words: Refill p.r.n. or ad. lib., meaning as often as is requested. How does the Federal government view this type of instruction? The view is that, if a doctor allows the pharmacist to refill it at will, he is violating his authority under the law, since he is the only one allowed to determine the amount of a drug to be used. What is usually done is that the druggist will call the doctor from time to time to see if the patient is still to receive the medicine, and in this way he is protecting himself from violating the law, as he is only acting in “good faith.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Drug Prices and How You Can Save</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no doubt that prescription prices are on the increase. According to a survey conducted yearly by the Eli Lilly Company, a large drug manufacturer, in 1944 the average pharmacy filled 6,343 prescriptions and the average prescription cost was $1.10. In its survey of 1963, it was found that the average store dispensed 17,320 prescriptions and the average cost was $3.39. These figures must be considered in the light of the fact that, according to this same survey, 19 percent or almost one out of five pharmacies operated at a net loss. Fifty-nine percent of all the 2,529 pharmacies in this survey operated their stores at a 5-percent net profit or less, on their invested capital. However, that survey showed that prescription costs have climbed from an average of $3.19 in 1960 to $3.25 in 1961, $3.32 in 1962 and $3.39 in 1963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many stores follow as a guide for prescription pricing the average cost of drugstore operation in their area. Often, in this case, the more you buy of the drug, the cheaper it becomes for each dose. As an example, you may be charged $1.50 for 24 tablets, but if you were to purchase 100 of the tablets the cost might only be doubled. Why is this? Because under this system of pricing, the pharmacist charges you a flat rate for the time involved in filling the prescription, and this is often the largest item in the cost of the prescription. He adds to this rate the cost of the medicine and a markup on the medicine, which is his profit on his investment. Since it takes no more time to fill a prescription for 100 than for 24, you make a large saving.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Those who are taking drugs over a long period of time can thus save money by buying in larger quantities. However, a note of caution! It is a good idea to shop in different stores to see what they will charge you for the larger quantity. Not all stores have the same policy in their prescription pricing and, if you are taking drugs over a period of time, a substantial saving can be made many times. Also, it is good to ask your own druggist for a price reduction for a larger quantity. Often he will not suggest it—he is making more money by filling it more often, and he may not honestly know that you are planning to continue to take the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ If a druggist knows that you are going to be price conscious, he usually will give you his best price when he is asked. And it will keep him honest if he thinks you may go down the street to ask there as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prices may differ considerably from store to store. It may be that one druggist has special prices from manufacturers. Also, not all druggists follow the same method in determining prescription prices. Some follow a scientifically arranged chart that gives a corresponding reduction for the quantity of a drug, based upon expenses and a profit on investment. Many druggists, however, just follow a rule-of-thumb guide and charge a certain percentage of the cost of the medicine. It is a common practice for the druggist to find his cost for the medicine you are going to receive and then to double it to get the retail price. Of course, if you are buying large quantities, you may not get any reduction under this system. In some more highly competitive areas, the profit may not be 50 percent but only 40 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How can you get the best price? First, ask your doctor if he will write the generic name; then the druggist can use any company’s product. Ask the druggist ahead of time what the price 1 will be. On highly j competitive items ! such as antibiotics 1 you will likely find that most druggists | charge about the &quot;&nbsp;same price, but in others there may be a great variety. Also ask if a prescription is required for the product your doctor has recommended; does it have the Rx legend? You may be surprised to learn that many prescriptions are written for vitamins or drugs that do not have the Rx legend. The pharmacist, not knowing the doctor’s intentions, will fill the prescription as if a prescription were required. Incidentally, he will charge you his prescription price, not the over-the-counter price, which may be considerably lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you ask for this information, the honest druggist will usually not hesitate to tell you. After all, you are a customer and his means of livelihood; and he does not want to offend you but, rather, wants to win your friendship. The druggist who is overcharging is usually the one who is reluctant to tell you the price. Naturally your druggist expects you to be pleasant as well. Often he has an aversion to the “bargain hunter,” but if you are pleasant in your inquiries, you will often find him helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Increasing drug prices may seem a bitter pill for many to have to swallow, but at least if one is aware of the possibilities of saving money, he will get more for his prescription dollar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font1">N ITS pure state, potassium is a silvery-white metal with a pinkish tinge, having radiant beauty. Its characteristics set it apart from all other minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throw some onto the surface of a pond —it will float—but at the same time you will see the amazing spectacle of water burning! The mineral begins to decompose the water, generating intense heat, which sets the liberated hydrogen on fire. This will burn with a brilliant violet-purple flame until the potassium is exhausted. At freezing point, potassium is hard and brittle, but raise its temperature to 60° Fahrenheit and you can knead it into any shape you wish or slice it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">with &amp;&nbsp;blunt </span><span class="font1">knife. When freshly cut, it quickly “rusts” because of its avidity for oxygen, forming a white film of potassium-hydroxide or “caustic potash,” which can quickly destroy your skin. Yes, this beautiful mineral in its purity must be handled with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">more than</span><span class="font1"> “kid </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gloves&quot; because it would </span><span class="font1">destroy these too!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in spite of its destructive nature, it is essential to the life of every living organism on earth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Importance of Potassium to</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Living Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like humans, plants need to eat properly. Without a balanced diet, humans can become seriously ill, and in the same way plants will suffer from a lack of certain elements in the soil. Years ago the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Indian discovered that his corn crop grew much better on land where brush had been burned. But he did not realize that the wood ashes supplied potash to the soil, which, in turn, supplied potassiuta to the corn. Yet potassium is now known to be a major nutrient for all plants and essential for their good health and yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">For yours?</span><span class="font1"> Yes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">that’s right'. For,</span><span class="font1"> If all potassium salts in the earth became exhausted, all life on earth would soon cease to exist. Plant life would be the first to suffer. Even today, plant life will warn its human caretakers when the soil becomes potassium-poor. Do you find the leaves of your young corn plants streaked with yellow and acquiring a scorched appearance on edges and tips? Do the stunted plants fail to produce ears, or at best produce poor ears that do not fill out to the tips? What about the small-grain plants that are suffering similarly, bending weakly on fragile stalks? Or the potato plant with its leaves becoming crinkled, yellow, finally dying, tubers underdeveloped and growth of the whole plant hindered or completely curbed? Eloquently, such plants are telling of their potassium deficiency!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If potassium were to become too scarce, animal and human deficiency symptoms would follow hard on the heels of those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the plant world. Signs of diminishing life </span><span class="font1">and activity would be noted everywhere. Even the waters of the lakes and seas would become strangely silent, with no fish to swarm in their depths or to break their mirrorlike surfaces. Sheep, the source of your winter “woolies,” would be quickly affected because potassium compounds are known to make up at least a third of the bulk of raw merino. The family pup would lose his bounce and zest, for dogs lacking this element have become paralyzed in neck and limbs. His master would find his own muscles responding more slowly, finally losing coordination. Even his most vital muscle, the heart, would develop an erratic beat. That potassium does have an important effect on heart action was dramatically shown by a scientist’s experiment on an animal heart that had ceased beating. When touched with his finger moistened with saliva, it started beating again. The stimulant proved to be the salts of sodium and potassium in the saliva. How vital, then, that man and beast as well as vegetation receive a constant supply of potassium!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>How Vegetation Gets Potassium</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The soil of the earth can be likened to a family larder. It should be stocked with all the necessary minerals to build strong and healthy plants. Just as the foods on the pantry shelves do not come onto the dinner table of their own accord, so the nutrients in the soil as a rule do not come to the plant, but the plant has to reach out for them by means of its root system. The plant’s water system is the food server, serving the minerals to the parts of the plant where they are most needed. In this way potassium can go to work building plant cells and. play an important part in forming proteins, cellulose, sugars and starches. It also has much to do with controlling the plant's rate of respiration. When drought comes, the potassium salts safeguard the plant from too great a loss of water and, besides this, it diminishes harm due to low temperatures. How it does all these things still baffles scientists; yet how vital it is that the larder of the soil be constantly replenished as available potassium is used up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Potassium is not fabricated into any part of the structure of plants, even though they need it for good health. As long as they live, plants retain their potassium salts, but as soon as they are cut and left on the fields, the rain quickly washes them out. In some cases, as plants ripen, the salts return to the earth. Nevertheless, as many crops are grown on a plot of ground, the tendency is for the available potash salts in the soil to be depleted. Why? Because the soil is quite close-fisted when it comes to doling out its hoard of this vital element. For example, an acre of land to a depth of half a foot may have a bank of twenty tons of these salts. Yet in some wonderful way the soil allows only a hundred to six hundred pounds of it to be usable for plant life. When that is used up, the bank cuts off the credit. Unless this credit balance of potash is restored, the plants will suffer malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is where man has a job to do in caring for the land. Fertilization of the soil is indicated. For many years, farmyard manure or wood ashes and even kelp were used to prepare the land for planting, doubtless with little knowledge of their contribution of potassium. But all these have come to be in short supply with the expanding demand for farm produce. So man has had to probe deeper into earth’s crust searching for potash, now one of the fundamental components of agricultural fertilizers. Farmers, at first hesitant about its use, began to realize its value with the advent of large-scale farming methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For small plots of ground, the adding of potash fertilizer can be done by hand. Vaster fields need specialized equipment. Such fertilizer application equipment having great capacity is available, and it is effective and precise In accomplishing the work. In fact, you might say that some of these machines are tailor-made so that no harm will be done to the seed, the roots or the foliage of the plants. In some cases the fertilizer is applied by low-flying airplanes. The bountiful harvests of Canada and the United States in recent years speak in glowing terms of the value of potassium and other fertilizers being added to the soil. Around the world the demand for potash fertilizers is rapidly increasing. Keeping abreast is steadily taxing the ingenuity of man in opening up new sources.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Available Sources</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A cause for marvel is that potassium makes up 21 percent of earth’s matter, yet the earth does not liberate for man’s use this vast hoard of the vital element without a str</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">uggl</span><span class="font1">e. A certain amount is contained in all rocks of the earth. Their disintegration over the centuries has furnished the available soluble salts in all fertile soils. The problem is that these rocks do not seem to disintegrate quickly enough to supply what is needed, and the economy of this world needs more and more. Where to get it has been the big question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The oceans themselves are said to contain more than a million billion tons of it Even though costly, seawater is being evaporated in South Africa to obtain potassium salts. Likewise, in Israel the waters of the Dead Sea are producing thousands of tons of potash to bring new life to the nutrient-starved lands of Asia. Brine wells in different parts of the earth yield their share. But the most economical sources of this mineral are the ones found deep down in the earth’s crust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mines at Stassfurt, Germany, were for many years the world’s main source of potash. World War II made it necessary for new deposits to be located in the Western Hemisphere. A mine near Carlsbad, New Mexico, became North America’s main source of supply. As the demand increased at the rate of 6 percent each year, more mines came into production. Other countries now became potash producers; the search for new sources of supply became global in extent. Chile produced nitrate of potash from its nitrate deposits. Large quantities were found in the salt mines of Kalusz in the eastern Carpathian Mountains of Russia. Then in 1943 oil exploration crews brought to light the first indications of the largest mineable body of potash ore in the world, three-fourths of a mile beneath the waving wheatlands of Saskatchewan, Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The Potash Capital of the World”—is what this area is now called, taking in eleven towns about a hundred miles east of Regina, the provincial capital. And no wonder! Because from here the ore body extends in a northwesterly direction for 450 miles, and in some places it is 50 miles wide! It is estimated by geologists that the deposit contains at least five billion tons of the mineral, enough to sustain production for centuries to come!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The world’s largest potash mine, at Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, owned and operated by International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, went into production just three years ago. It took them five years to sink a shaft 18 feet in diameter, 3,132 feet (2| times the height of the Empire State Building in New York) down to the potash. IMC describes this shaftsinking project as the “toughest ever completed in the Western Hemisphere.” But after its completion, continuous mining machines weighing 52 tons each, went to work biting out five tons of glistening crystals of halite and sylvite (potash ore) every minute. As a result, 1.2 million tons of potash are now being pourqd onto the world market every year, leaving the mine site daily in trains three-fourths of a mile in length.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Its Many Uses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ninety percent of all potash mined will go back into the soil as fertilizer. The remaining 10 percent is used in our everyday living in a great variety of ways. It is employed in the manufacture of dyes, synthetic rubber, soaps, textiles, paper, glass and wallboard. Your vitamin pills may have potash in them as well as many of the medicines you get from your drugstore. Batteries require this versatile mineral and so may the fire extinguisher hanging on your wall. If you use matches to light your stove, you can be grateful that potash is being mined, because they contain it. Without potassium you would be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">unable to enjoy the hobby of photography. </span><span class="font1">Even astronauts who have orbited the earth in recent months could not have done so without potassium-peroxide (a long-lasting source of oxygen) in their breathing mechanism. To his hurt though, man has discovered it to be useful in the manufacture </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of high explosives, gunpowder and </span><span class="font1">other weapons of war. Even though this makes it a mineral used to bring death, yet it is very evident that potassium is a vital mineral, one necessary to life, and truly this makes it a blessing to mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">extensively required years of study. Just to read a newspaper meant that a person had to learn approximately 1,300 ideographic Chinese characters. The common people had neither the time nor the opportunity to pursue the studies necessary to learn such characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Korean education in past centuries was a privilege that was limited primarily to some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">yang-bahn,</span><span class="font1"> two classes of nobility including government officials. Women had no opportunity whatever to be educated. Until the turn of the present century it was not considered necessary or proper for a woman to get a formal education. Missionaries influenced, to some extent, a revolution in this viewpoint by establishing colleges and universities for women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was back in the fifteenth century during Korea’s third dynasty, the Yi Dynasty, that efforts began to be made to produce a simplified Korean alphabet. The Korean king by the name of Sejong reasoned that a good government must be able to communicate with the common man, otherwise much of the power for good of the governing arm would be lost. With these thoughts in mind he and his associates began devising a system whereby the sounds of the Korean language could be simply, yet accurately, put into writing. His idea was to have a phonetic system that would be so effective that the lowliest farmer in the rice paddy would be able to become literate. King Sejong’s ambition led to the production of a remarkable alphabet that was ready for use by the time he reached forty-six years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When King Sejong introduced the Korean alphabet to his people, he said: “I have devised 28 letters for the convenience of every individual who should be able easily to master them.” Like the English alphabet, less than thirty letters were used to express every sound and combination of sounds in the Korean language. It was not long, however, until four of the original twenty-eight letters of Hangul were dropped. It was decided that they actually represented Chinese sound values rather than true Korean and could be absorbed by the other twenty-four characters. That is the way the Hangul alphabet stands today. Unlike Japanese, it has never been accurately or uniformly Romanized by employing Roman letters for Korean sounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whereas the ideographic symbols of Chinese writing dictate the meaning of a sentence by the order in which they appear, Korean takes its meaning frbm postpositions added to word stems. To oversimplify an involved grammatical system, we might say that there are basic sets of postpositions to follow first the subject of a sentence, then the object, plus various endings on the verb stem to indicate a question, command, levels of speech for elders and superiors, equals, children, and so forth. It is admitted that one of the shortcomings of the Korean alphabetical system is that it did not take into adequate consideration these postpositions and their sound relation to their stem word and succeeding words. Although minor changes have occurred in Hangul, it remains essentially the same today as it was the day it was released for public use in the year 1443.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite the effort that was made to get away from Chinese, Hangul was greatly influenced by it as to style of writing. Like Chinese, it is principally written vertically and from right to left, although it can be written horizontally. Like Chinese characters that are written in box form, the syllables of Korean words are also written in box shape with each box consisting of two to five characters. The boxes are then used to build up words. In English we could compare this with writing the word “alphabet” by boxing the *i <sub>pH BE </sub>syllables in this fashion nL A T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Korean characters are not uniform in size but vary according to their position in the box. A person has to learn, when studying Hangul, to make the letters small or large and to place them high or low in order to preserve the appearance of a square. Capital and lowercase letters are not used in Hangul. The names of foreign persons and places, however, are underscored, but native names are not. There have been some experiments made with writing the letters successively to build words instead of syllables but these experiments have not been favorably received because of the difficulty of being able to pick out the syllables at a glance. A person may have to hesitate and decide if a certain letter is to be sounded as the last letter of the preceding syllable or the beginning of the next.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Opposition to Hangul</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was opposition to Hangul when it was first introduced to the Korean people. Government officials should have been happy with this means of carrying on a mass education program that would overcome the backwardness and illiteracy of Korea, but they were not. As is so often the case, the upper classes were not happy about the lower classes’ becoming educated. Then, too, since Chinese was traditionally associated with the intelligentsia, the learned men considered the abandonment of Chinese characters as unthinkable. They took the view that Hangul was far beneath their dignity and, as compared with Chinese, was a crude way of writing. Letters of protest were written by Cho Man-li, in which he contended: “It is against the traditional principle of following Chinese culture. ... To discard Chinese characters is to return to a state of barbarism.” His arguments against Hangul were to the effect that it would ruin Korea’s friendly relationship with China, cause hindrance to study and inefficiency to administration. He claimed that for men of letters Hangul was “no more than literary amusement,” and would therefore be “merely a waste of time for princes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the thirty-six years of Japanese occupation, writing and speaking Korean were curbed and later banned. Japanese was what the people were required to speak under a threat of punishment. However, the publication of much literature in Hangul during the late 1800’s, before the Japanese occupation began in 1910, helped to preserve it through that difficult period. After the Korean liberation in 1945, a great wave of nationalism swept through the country, and an effort was made to regain individualism of government, language and culture. Hangul was revived and used in an adult education program. That literacy promotion campaign is regarded as the maternal basis for the present Korean system of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1953 there were 42,000 National Alphabet Diffusion Classes organized throughout the country. With this literacy effort and compulsory literacy classes, remarkable progress has been made in teaching the Korean people to read and write. Hangul bears much of the credit for reducing illiteracy to its present low level of 10 percent. Hangul is now in popular use and is the writing form used by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in its Korean Bible-study aids.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Hangul Is Practical</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aside from being a greatly simplified form of writing as compared with Chinese, it is adaptable to a Western typewriter, which makes it unique among Oriental languages. By using this simplified alphabet, syllables that require intricate Chinese- ideographs can be expressed by two, three or four strokes of the typewriter on one typewriter space. A Western typewriter can be adapted to Hangul by changing the face of the type and modifying the machine so that the keys on the right side start off the characters typed in an imaginary square by moving the carriage one space. The keys on the left side simply add characters to the imaginary square without moving the carriage. The touchtyping system can be used with speeds that approximate typing in English. Some characters must appear on the keyboard more than once, depending on whether they are used at the beginning or at the end of the syllable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite its practicalness as a simple means of making a high percentage of the Koreans literate, there are so many Chinese words peppering the Korean language that Chinese is still nationally used in writing. Elven in principally Hangul literature, a word will often be written in Korean characters followed by Chinese characters in parentheses in order to eliminate ambiguity and doubt as to the meaning of a word. It seems that for a while longer Chinese characters must be used to clarify Korean words that are spelled and pronounced the same but have multiple meanings. The newspaper employs Chinese characters to such an extent that the younger generation is unable to read the entire paper because schools have given them only a superficial and limited knowledge of Chinese characters. The desire is to eliminate Chinese from the Korean language, and the best place to start is with the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After more than 500 years of existence the Korean art of writing has come into its own, being popularly accepted and used by the Korean people. Because of its simplicity it is at last achieving what King Sejong envisioned for it back in the fifteenth century by making it possible for the lowliest farmer in a rice paddy to know how to write.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">• The size of the river Amazon, measured by its rate of flow, has been estimated by scientists to range from three to five million cubic feet per second. The estimates have now given way to measurement, A United States-Brazilian hydrologic field party measured the river’s rate of flow in 1963 at a location about 500 miles upstream from the river’s mouth, during both high-water and low-water seasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The Amazon’s average flow at that point was tentatively measured at 6,600,000 cubic feet per second. What was the calculation of the river’s average flow into the Atlantic Ocean? It was set at 7,500,000 cubic feet per second—equal to 3,400,000,000 gallons per minute! If the water expelled from the Amazon in just one day were spread over Texas, that vast state would be covered to a one-inch depth, the Hawaiian Islands to a depth of more than three feet. The new look at the Amazon’s size reveals that its flow is more than five times that of the Congo River, the second-largest river in the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">• A youthful Witness in California relates </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">this experience: “At school, in speech and £5 drama class, I was assigned to do a debate H on evolution. There were two for it and two </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">against it. I was assigned to back up the JJ theory. However, since I am not in agree- M ment with it, I persuaded my teacher to let </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">me be on the side opposing evolution. Then I went to look for information in the Watch H Tower Society’s publications. By using the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font19"> I found much information in various issues of the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">AwaJcel,• I</span><span class="font19"> also used the So- M ciety’s booklet </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus the New</span><span class="font19"> H </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font19"> dividing up the information in it between myself and another schoolmate. Each K person on the team had six minutes to de- </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">fend his side. Then after each had his turn, &amp;&nbsp;we got three minutes to refute what the q others had said.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">“The side that was to champion evolution </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">showed such little argument that when it came time for rebuttal, there wasn’t any- M thing to refute. I had to bring up some com- </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">mon arguments used to support evolution and refute them in order to fill up the three </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">minutes. When we had completed the debate, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font19">the class asked many questions. A vote was then taken among the students to determine H which side they thought had won the de- M bate. Our side upholding creation and God's </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font19">Word, the Bible, got all the votes. The teacher </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font19">had not expected that we could do much with such a deep subject; he and the class H were impressed by the information upholding the truth of the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MANY CLASSES HEAR 8IBLE TRUTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">• A Witness in Arizona writes: “I am a sophomore in high school. When we started to discuss evolution in my world history class, my teacher stated his views and then called on me to express my views on evolution. I told him what I had learned from reading the Bible and from studying the publications of the Watch Tower Society. After I had finished, he looked at me as if displeased and asked me if I could prove my statements on evolution. I answered, Yes. Then he said that he himself would conduct a debate with^ me on evolution during which, he said, I would have a chance to prove my statements.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">“During the weekend I gathered information on evolution by using the Society's </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Index. </span><span class="font19">On Monday I went to class with a Bible and other material. When the time came for me to speak, I first asked the class if they themselves believed in the Bible. They all raised their hands in affirmation. Then I began to speak, using the Bible as my main source of information and to establish what is truth. When I finished presenting both Biblical and scientific information upholding creation, my teacher stood up and said that there was no need now for him to express his views on evolution because, as he put it, ‘You have not only proved your statements scientifically but Seri pt ur ally.* He then asked me where I had learned so much about the Bible. I told him I was one of Jehovah's witnesses and that we had weekly meetings to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">“After class my teacher asked me to present my material on evolution to his other classes. Also, another teacher who taught American Problems asked me to give my information to his classes. I was asked to give a test to all of his American Problems classes on the material I presented. As a result, I was able to put in fourteen hours, teaching the different history classes, placing four books and twenty-two </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font19"> and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font19"> magazines. It was a great blessing and privilege to stand up for God’s Word, the Bible.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By “AwnkaT<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">correspondent Tn the Philippine*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is, I am very pleased to meet you. How about us getting to know each other better? First of all, let me tell you a little about myself.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">H</span><span class="font1">ELLO there!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My name is Miss Orchid. What is yours? Whatever it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To begin with, mine is a very large family, and a very complex one too. Botanists have discovered and named over 16,000 different species in my family, but there are even more of us. As they get to know my relatives the list continues to lengthen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Various members of my family thrive in most places on earth, perching atop giant trees, sitting prettily on plateaus and cliffs, or growing from lofty vertical rock faces. Often I prefer to lie in the beds of streams, or on the rich, leaf-mold floors of forests. Sometimes I choose to play among the clouds and snow high up in the Andes, or even higher up in the Himalayas, thousands of feet above sea level. Other members of my family make a home in the warm valleys of Mexico, Nepal and Java, as well as the icy forests of northern Canada. So you see, I am not as choosy about where I live as you might think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">People say that I am as temperamental as a prima donna. They say that I have to be coddled and pampered. They put me on a pedestal and think that having me is very expensive and that only a very few can cater to my whims. But this is not necessarily true. I live, I grow and I die just like any other flowering plant. Believe me, I am sometimes as easy to grow as a rose. My needs are very simple: fresh air,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">OF THE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">water, food and sunlight in the right amounts and at the right time. Anywhere you live—in Manila, Karachi, Madrid or Rio de Janeiro—you can grow me. Whether in a kitchen window, in a coconut husk, in a ship cabin, or in a garden or greenhouse, it does not matter. Understanding and consideration will help foster good relations between the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, I do not wish to sound conceited, but it is a fact that I am noted for my grace and beauty. My figure varies. Sometimes it is extremely delicate and graceful, while at other times it is not. At times I bear a striking resemblance to a graceful swan or to a gentle dove. But I come, too, in odd and not too charming shapes resembling a frog, lizard or monkey. My color ranges through every known shade and every conceivable hue. I am a photographer’s delight. How they enjoy their shutterclicking as I pose and pose and pose, garbed in all the colors of the rainbow! Besides pink or white or lavender, I can be spectacularly dressed in mustard yellow, chocolate brown, empire green, or reddish-yellow. Now, do you not agree that I am very fashionable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Am I fragrant? Yes, indeed! Sometimes I give off the most powerful and lasting fragrance. If, while visiting the Philippines, you should walk under a tree with a blooming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sangumay,</span><span class="font1"> it will leave an unforgettable impression. But, unfortunately, I also produce some of the foulest odors. It is said that some of the natives of Borneo dare not go near me because of the unendurable smell. Can you imagine that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am useful too. For food flavor and mouth-watering aroma, why not try my vanilla? Salep, the dried tubers of various orchids, is used as a baby food and a dessert. Also, if you are plagued with dysentery, rheumatism or indigestion, I can be of assistance to you.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Beauty Parade</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps you would like to see some of my model sisters pass in review. I am sure you will appreciate the sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First of all, here is Miss Bletia, a popular tropical orchid noted for the ease with which she is grown. Originally discovered in the West Indies, she also abounds profusely on the steppes of China. Her flowers are small and she comes in rose, lilac, purple and white hues. She adapts easily. Her place matters not, whether indoors, outdoors or in a greenhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the judges’ nod for the most beautiful of them all may well go to Miss Disa. Referred to as the “Flower of the Gods&quot; by the African natives, she was later nicknamed the “Pride of the Table Mountain.” Her striking scarlet or flaming-red form is truly a beauty to behold! She is a terrestrial orchid, and is one member of our family that is not so easy to cultivate. For her abode she loves to dwell on the edges of streams and on the ledges of waterfalls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Miss Disa’s beauty crown, however, is challenged by Miss Waling-waling of the Philippines. She, too, is a real aristocrat. In her lofty throne, on the topmost branches of giant trees, she is not easy to reach. Her leaves are V-shaped, and her petals come in rose and purple marked with irregular spots. She remains in bloom for more than a month, and her flowers last a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Miss Lycaste is another beauty queen. Her discoverer considered her the consummation of his lifelong search for rare and beautiful plants. She holds a record for longevity in bloom. The ones coming from Guatemala are hardy and they flower abundantly, the blossoms being deliciously fragrant</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here comes Miss Dendrobin. Once she made fortunes for plant collectors. She rates high in the world market but is a rarity, since she dies fast and has to be imported into most countries. She resembles a bamboo, and her name means “treelife.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When most people think of me they think of romance. Is it because I grace many grand weddings? Or is it because I find my way into a ballroom or party on the shoulders or in the hair of a lovely mademoiselle, a beautiful seiiorita, a graceful hula dancer, a doll-like geisha or a demure </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inday?<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark57">1</a></sup></span><span class="font1"> Whatever the case may be, when people speak of orchids, what generally comes to their mind is Miss Cat-tleya. She is known as the florist’s orchid. She comes in shades of pink, lavender and white, and occasionally in shades of chartreuse, apricot yellow and red. She stands out in a crowd for her striking appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, your own choice depends on your taste. You may prefer Miss Disa for her flaming beauty. Or perhaps you would rather have Miss Waling-waling for her exquisite shape and color. Maybe the sweet fragrance of Miss Lycaste attracts you. But whatever your taste, I know that there is someone in my family that will suit you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here I have done all the talking, and yet I have really only begun to tell you about my family. But I guess it is enough to tell you that my family in its manifold varieties simply helps one to appreciate what a man of God once said: ‘Everything God has made pretty in its time.’—Eccl. 3:11.</span></p><img src="g_E_19650908_files/g_E_19650908-11.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:116pt;">
<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font1">MONG the many provisions of the Mosaic law covenant that Jehovah made with the nation of Israel was the Nazirite vow or Naziriteship. The term “Nazirite” means one who is separated or consecrated. One came to be a Nazirite by reason of a special vow, the Hebrew root implying “the clear and solemn utterance of some expressed purpose.” All the days that the vow was in effect the Nazirite was to be “holy to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The law of Naziriteship is found at Numbers 6:1-21 and concerns itself with three basic conditions. First of all, the fruit of the vine in any form was forbidden, together with all other intoxicating beverages. Secondly, the Nazirite had to let his hair grow long on his face and head, as no razor was to come upon him during his vow. Thirdly, the Nazirite was to keep himself ceremonially clean by not touching any dead body, not even that of his closest and dearest relatives. Accidentally touching such a body would cancel the vow and require certain offerings to be made. At the end of one’s Naziriteship certain offerings were required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The three basic conditions of Naziriteship were quite meaningful. The first one, prohibiting the use of the product of the vine in any form as well as all intoxicating liquors, required self-denial. And note its practical aspects. No necessary food was forbidden, so that work could be carried on as usual and there was no excuse for going around with a long face, as did the hypocritical Pharisees of Jesus’ day. Nevertheless, the self-denial was real, for the'product of the vine is associated with gladness: “Wine . . . makes the heart of mortal man rejoice.” “Wine itself makes the life rejoice.”—Ps. 104:15; Eccl. 10:19; Judg. 9: 12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Nazirite was to find his joy in Jehovah. And the forbidding of all intoxicating liquors calls to mind that the same applied to the priests, but only when serving officially. This would seem to imply that the Nazirite had to be careful all the days of his vow, as were the priests when on active duty.—Lev. 10:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second stipulation also was full of meaning. Letting the hair grow long made the fact of one’s being a Nazirite public knowledge. There was no being ashamed of being under a vow to be holy to Jehovah. More than that, it morally obligated others not to offer a Nazirite wine or other strong drink, as well as showing why these were refused by the Nazirite. Condemning the wickedness of some, the prophet said, “But you kept giving the Nazirites wine to drink.”—Amos 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then again, since it was only those of womankind, who were in subjection to either their fathers or their husbands, that wore long hair, by this long hair the Nazirite was reminded of his submission to Jehovah. It is of interest that the vines that were not pruned or harvested during the sabbath or jubilee years were termed Nazirite vines, holy to Jehovah. Thus the Jewish commentator, Hertz, states, about Leviticus 25:5: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Undressed vine.</span><span class="font1"> The Heb. is the word for a Nazirite whose hair was to remain unshorn. (Num. 6:5) Like him, the vines were not to be trimmed during the Sabbatical year. There was to be neither planting, pruning nor gathering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And third, meaningful was the requirement of not touching anyone dead, not even one’s closest relative. Since touching a dead body made one ceremonially unclean, this regulation emphasized the importance of the Nazirite’s keeping himself clean, in a sanctified condition, as it were. Here again, we note the importance attached to this prohibition in that only the high priest of Israel had a similar one placed upon him.—Lev. 21:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a rule, the condition of Naziriteship was a voluntary one, with the individual himself determining just how long and when he wished to be a Nazirite, specially consecrated to Jehovah. However, at times Jehovah himself imposed it upon individuals, as when he commanded regarding Samson: “A Nazirite of God is what the child will become” from his birth. Likewise, Zechariah was told regarding his son John to be born, that “he must drink no wine and strong drink at all, and he will be filled with holy spirit right from his mother’s womb.” On the other hand, it might be said that Samuel’s mother determined that he would be a Nazirite, for she vowed that, if God gave her a son, she would “give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head.” —Judg. 13:3-5; Luke 1:13-15; 1 Sam. 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may be, however, that Jehovah raised up others, or at least caused his holy spirit to move others to be Nazirites. This seems to be indicated by his words: “I kept raising up some of your sons as prophets and some of your young men as Nazirites.” Jehovah’s associating the Nazirites with the prophets would seem to imply that, not only did Jehovah have a high regard for the Nazirites, but also these in some way witnessed for him, by their actions if not also by word of mouth.—Amos 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of what value to us today is this historical information? Did the Nazirite arrangement or provision foreshadow anything in particular today? In the absence of any reference to such a thing in the Christian Greek Scriptures, it would be unwise to be dogmatic. But in view of this being part of “all the things . . . written aforetime ... for our instruction,” it seems that certain helpful analogies might be drawn.—Rom. 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, even as all the Israelites were members of a dedicated nation, so all dedicated Christians today, “men of good will,” are members of one organization of persons devoted to Jehovah. And just as some back there felt the need or saw their privilege of going farther in being more fully set apart to Jehovah, so today many see their privilege, not only of leading lives of dedication to Jehovah but, to enter the full-time Christian service, for a certain length of time, as vacation pioneers, or indefinitely as missionaries, regular and special pioneers and members of headquarters staffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such full-time ministry invariably involves a measure of self-denial of the material good things that make glad the heart of man, even as Naziriteship did back there. A life such as this may also be said to represent a greater degree of submission to God and to his organization than is required of those serving part time. And even as the Nazirite vow might come between one and his closest relative in the event of death, so today, many in the fulltime service find that it means leaving one’s immediate family and perhaps not even being able to return home for the funeral of one’s closest relative because of being in a faraway assignment. Their one desire is to serve Jehovah to the fullest extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These thoughts should certainly be an encouragement to all in the full-time ministerial service and help all others to appreciate more fully the privilege of sharing fully in making known God’s Word of truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Word of Truth&quot; Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;#&gt; The series of &quot;Word of Truth&quot; District Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses continued during July. From July 14 to 18 fine gatherings were held in Vienna, Austria, and Basel, Switzerland, with peak attendances of 12,226 and 36,190. In Vienna 65 attended from Turkey, 1,250 delegates came from Greece and there were also representatives present from Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Basel, the largest of the assemblies up until then, had a real international atmosphere. The program was conducted in five languages, including German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French. From July 21 to 25 the last of the summer series of “Word of Truth&quot; assemblies in Europe was held in Berlin where a grand total of 8,916 persons were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In the United States during July, 12,059 were present in Monterey, California, 10,186 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 5,011 at Lubbock, Texas, for the “Word of Truth&quot; assemblies in those cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Pictures of Mars</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">■$&gt; On July 15 the United States spacecraft Mariner IV came within 6,118 miles of Mars and relayed photographs of that planet 134,000,000 miles back to earth. Mariner IV took over seven months to reach its destination, having been en route since last November 28. According to the series of photographs received, Mars is even more inhospitable than scientists had previously believed. Its atmosphere of air appears to be extraordinarily thin and at times blows at a terrifying velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Heaviest Man-made Satellite</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;§&gt; On July 16 the Soviet Union put into orbit an unmanned space vehicle weighing more than 26,000 pounds. It was the heaviest pay load ever launched, surpassing the weight of the 21,000-pound satellite put into orbit by the United States on June 18. Great strides in the field of space exploration have been made since the first artificial satellite weighing 184 pounds was orbited by the Russians less than eight years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Change in Greek Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">On July 15 Greek premier George Papandreou was ousted by King Constantine and Athanasiadis Novas succeeded him. Papandreou was accused of tolerating leftist penetration of the army. The change was greeted with daily demonstrations as citizens protested Papandreou's ouster. On July 21 violence broke out when the police battled 10,000 demonstrators for four hours in downtown Athens. One person was killed and 130 hurt as tear gas finally routed the demonstrators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Stevenson Dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"># On July 14 Ad lai Stevenson, the United States representative to the United Nations, dropped dead from a heart attack on a London street. Stevenson was the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952 and 1956, when he was defeated each time by Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson died with the world in even worse shape than he described in a speech in 1949. At that time he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">“Ours is a sad, disillusioned world. Too many people on this blood-soaked, battered globe live in constant fear and dread; fear of hunger and want, dread of oppression and slavery. Poverty, starvation, disease and repression stalk the world and over us all hangs the menace of war like a gloomy shroud. But everywhere people cling to their hope and their faith in freedom, justice and peace, though fear, anguish and even death, are their daily lot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">U.N. Ineffectual</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">On hearing the report of Adlai Stevenson's death, last year’s Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, commented; There is “no evidence that the United Nations under his or anyone else’s leadership has accomplished anything.” However, Goldwater was quick to add: &quot;That’s not meant in disrespect for Stevenson’s efforts. It’s like trying fo swim up Lava Falls on the Colorado River, and that’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Storms Claim Lives</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; Toward the end of July heavy rains caused flooding and landslides in southwestern Japan, claiming at least fourteen lives. Storms also battered the central and southern coastline of Chile, leaving twelve dead, scores missing and thousands homeless. Floods washed away thousands of mud-caked adobe homes. The week before floods in central Korea were the worst experienced in seventy years. On July 17 the death toil had reached seventy-four and 142,-000 were homeless. About the same time a typhoon struck the southern coast of China, sinking more than forty fishing boats and drowning some 200 fishermen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Which Report to Believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; On July 18 North Vietnam claimed that its gunners shot down three United States planes and captured two pilots during air attacks. &quot;In Saigon,” the New York </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font19">said, ‘‘United States officials reported that all planes had returned safely from the day’s strikes in North Vietnam.” Such conflicting reports are common during wartime, raising questions as to who is telling the truth. In this case, the truth may have been revealed when pictures of the downed pilots were released by the North Vietnamese news agency and appeared in the New York </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font19"> of July 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">British Crime Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; An annual report on police operations in Britain shows that indictable offenses totaled 1,066,467 in 1964, an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. Robberies were up 23.4 percent and crimes of violence rose 16.9 percent. The report said that only 40 percent of the crimes were cleared up, and in the London area only 25 percent were solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Why VD Increases</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A study by the World Health Organization identified the disappearance of the chaperon as one of the reasons for the increase of venereal disease among youths. Noting that &quot;young women no longer have to submit to the supervision of chaperones,&quot; the study said that “like other newly won freedoms, this has led to a measure of license.” Other reasons listed for the rise in venereal disease were: ignorance of sex, decline of religious faith, lack of discipline in home life, less fear of contracting a venereal disease, emphasis on sexuality in modern life, and false ideas that sexual self-restraint is damaging to the personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Airline Crashes</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; On July 8 a Canadian Pacific Airlines DC6-B crashed in western Canada about 170 miles northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia. A11 52 persons aboard were killed. It was the worst crash in British Columbia since December 9, 1956, when a Trans-Canada Air Lines North Star went down, killing 62 persons. An investigation revealed traces of acid splattered about a section of the plane, and the possibility was considered that an explosive acid was responsible for the tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">A similar tragedy was averted on July 23 when pilot A. J. Lauber brought his flaming airliner down in a wooded area near Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Both wings were sheared off by the landing and fire soon destroyed the plane, but all forty persons aboard escaped In time without serious injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Longest Auto Tunnel Opened</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"># On July 16 the two-lane highway that tunnels for 7.2 miles beneath 15,781-foot-high Mont Blanc was officially opened. It is the longest tunnel for automobile traffic in the world, and will shorten the driving distance between Rome and Paris by 125 miles in summer, and even more in winter when snows close the Alpine passes. Tolls will range from $1.10 for motorcycles to $8 for the biggest cars and up to $30 for large trucks. The tunnel was six years in construction, with France and Italy equally sharing the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Drug Bill Passes</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; On July 15 United States president Lyndon Johnson signed a bill making possession of barbiturates and amphetamines by anyone other than a legitimate manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or user a crime punishable by a two-year jail sentence, a $5,000 fine or both. A subsequent offense is punishable by six years in jail or a $15,000 fine or both. &quot;Enough goof balls and pep pills,” the president said, “are being manufactured this year to provide two dozen pills to every man, woman and child in the United States.” The bill is designed to restrict the tremendous increase of illicit traffic in these pills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Religion Evaluated</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; There exists a similarity between the religion in America today and that in Germany in the days before Nazism, said Pastor Martin Niemoller, one of six presidents of the World Council of Churches. He said that religion in America today has “fallen asleep” and he further stated that he felt the same way about religion in Germany thirty years ago. The country’s prosperity, its materialism, is the cause. “A full belly is not interested in religious life,” Niemoller remarked. “People interested in money aren’t interested in their souls in church.” Hard times bring people to God. “Times of tension and suffering make people think and when they think, they come to know God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Preachers Trade Blows</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; On July 4 two ministers became involved in a scuffle during church services at the Banner Street Trinity Church of God in Danville, Virginia. G. L. McGuire entered the church expecting to deliver the Sunday sermon, but H. E. O’Ham was already conducting the service. McGuire informed the congregation that O’Ham was out of order and told the minister to take his seat. Although there were conflicting reports about what followed, apparently blows were traded. Both ministers swore out warrants against each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Cat’s Death Enriches University</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Because a cat died in July, George Washington University is $415,000 richer. Dr. William W. Grier, who passed away in June of 1963, left his fortune to his two cats with the stipulation that when they died the money would go to the university. The first cat died in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Polio Cases Drop</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$■ From a high in 1952 of 57,879 polio cases in the United States, there has been a precipitous drop to a record low in 1964 of only 91 cases of paralytic polio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Silver in Coins</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">On July 15 the U.S. Congress completed action on a bill that will eliminate all silver from dimes and quarters and will reduce the amount In half-dollars from 90 to 40 percent. The silver shortage prompted this action. Future dimes and quarters will consist of copper and a nickelcopper alloy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Cigarettes and Immorality</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; A recent three-year study of teen-agers, 15 to 19 years of age, In England and Wales shows a direct relationship between cigarette smoking and illicit sex activity. “There is a clear association,” the report said, “between sex activity and the number of cigarettes smoked a day. Practically all the girls who smoked more than 20 a day and half the boys who smoked that number were sexually experienced.” Noted Michael Schofield, research director of the Central Council for Health Education, who headed the investigation: “The results of this research show that those who are having sexual intercourse are not a tiny minority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Butt Uttdavjjw® Surgwy</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">On July 22 the prize bull, Lindertis Evulse, sold for $176,400 in 1963, underwent surgery in an attempt to cure his sterility. If the operation is successful it may prove to be the most expensive surgical operation in history. Dr. James Hicks will receive one-third of the profits from the bull during the next two years, and these are estimated to be more than $300,000. Of course, if the operation is not successful Lindertis Evulse will probably end up on someone’s steak platter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Grace and majesty are not the measurements of the ferocity of a beast. Nor can these qualities alone measure the fitness of an organization to supply your family with needed safety and spiritual security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today, millions of sincere persons around the world are entrusting their lives to the “religion of their choice.” Yet the Bible makes a strong contrast between true and false worship of the Almighty God. It says too that God’s Adversary, the Devil, is walking around like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone, yet it also says that the Devil appears as an angel of light and concludes; “It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.” How can you protect yourself and your family against such false “ministers”? How can you assure yourself of safety and spiritual security? How can you properly discern the true quality of the “religion of your choice”?</span></p>

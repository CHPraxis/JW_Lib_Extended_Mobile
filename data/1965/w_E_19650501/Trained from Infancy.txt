Trained from Infancy
◆ A Brazilian witness of Jehovah who has ten children and whose husband is not a believer reports how her efforts to teach her children have been blessed: “Some of my children are zealous, being regular publishers, and others are very small; but even so I ask the blessing at mealtimes and consider the daily text with them. I also study with them every week. One of the greatest blessings that Jehovah has granted me is that my children already have the truth in their hearts. One day my husband took one of our daughters to the open market in the town of Cabo. At lunch time he decided to eat a delicacy, the well-known haggis, which is made of blood. The little girl who was with him is very bright and knows what haggis is, that it is made of blood. Do you know what happened? When her father gave her a plateful of haggis, the little girl said: ‘Daddy, this food contains blood. I can’t eat it, because Jehovah doesn’t like people to eat blood.’ The child is only four years old.” Truly, such a mother trains her children ‘according to the way for them.’—Prov. 22:6; Acts 15:20, 28, 29.

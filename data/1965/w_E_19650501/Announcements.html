<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses count it a privilege to carry the message of God’s kingdom to all kinds of persons. But before those hearers of the good news may themselves become public servants of God, they must abandon the false religious practices and the immoral ways of the world around them and bring their lives into harmony with the requirements set out in God’s Word, the Bible. To aid them to do this, during the month of May Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering the Bible-study book <em>“Let God Be True,” </em>with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>IS GOD’S WILL WAR OR PEACE?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">War or peace? What does the future hold? Almost since the beginning of man’s history, men have sought to look into the future without success. Yet always in that future have been war and death. Is that always to be so? Not if we are to believe the words Jesus taught us to pray: “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Do you believe those words as you pray them? Have you ever wondered what is God’s will that is to be done on earth? The book <em>“Your Will Be Done on Earth” </em>goes to the Bible itself for the answer. Obtain your copy for only 50c. Send today and receive free the booklet <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New.”</em></p>

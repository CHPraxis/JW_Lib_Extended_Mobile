<p><span class="font5">H</span><span class="font1">AS someone recently offered you a suggestion? Perhaps it was on how you should conduct your business, perform your work, decorate your home or improve your appearance. How did you react? Some people consider suggestions an insult, an inference that they lack ability to handle matters, or a challenge to their position. However, suggestions can abound with benefits, especially if they are given in sincerity and received by a person desirous of making improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who rebel at suggestions often do so because they do not truly appreciate what suggestions are. They view them as implied orders given by someone who has no authority to command. But, in actuality, a suggestion can be just a proposal presented, not to command action, but, rather, to stimulate consideration. Action is left entirely up to the discretion of the hearer. So instead of being offended when someone offers a suggestion, a wise person appreciates that the offerer has enough respect for his judgment to present a suggestion and then let him decide on its value. As has been said, 'a word to the wise is sufficient.&quot; If we are wise we will value a timely suggestion as we would gold. How true the proverb, “As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it”! —Prov. 25:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While many persons appreciate that they can benefit from a sound suggestion, it is noteworthy that the benefits can be reciprocal, shared by both the person acting on the suggestion and the one offering it. The individual whose suggestion has been accepted and successfully applied receives the satisfaction of seeing his idea benefit others. Additionally, he often receives a tangible benefit. This recently has been the experience of many workers at their places of employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For years the ‘suggestion box’ served more as a source of amusement than of improvement. Why so? Well, if, out of an honest desire to improve working conditions or reduce waste, you offered two or three practical suggestions 'that were rejected because of your employer’s pride or were never even considered, would you have a desire to continue trying to offer beneficial suggestions? But that is what has happened in countless business establishments. Consequently, suggestions were stifled. But now wise business leaders, appreciating that their employees are in position to offer practical and profitable ideas, are trying to elicit suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to encourage employee suggestions, many firms have instituted suggestion systems, offering cash awards to employees based on the expected savings for the company that result from their applied suggestions. It has been estimated that in 1960 United States companies paid $20,000,000 for such recommendations. One firm that makes electronic computers had a problem with the wheels on its tape recorders slipping. An employee suggested that a small metal shim be added when the equipment was manufactured. What was the result? The company substantially reduced maintenance and repair costs. How about the employee? He received $32,000 for the suggestion! At another firm a woman saw that the drive belt on her machine frayed rapidly and became unsightly. Motivated by her feminine sense of tidiness, she put some nail polish on the edges of the belt. Other employees convinced her that she should submit the idea as a suggestion. Outcome? The company found that the belts lasted longer if the edges were coated with lacquer. Applying the suggestion, the firm saved $43,000 the first year and paid the woman $6,000 for her idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, sometimes it is necessary to overcome personal pride or imagined selfimportance in order to accept suggestions. For instance, in the days of the Hebrew prophet Elisha, the chief of the Syrian army, Naaman, was a leper. A captive Israelite slave girl suggested to her mistress, Naaman’s wife, that Elisha could cure Naaman of his leprosy. The suggestion was passed on to the king of Syria, and he sent Naaman to Israel. When Naaman was told in a message from the prophet to bathe seven times in the Jordan River, he became indignant, feeling that at least Elisha could have personally appeared and performed some special hand-waving to cure him instead of asking him to bathe in a river that was muddier than those in his own country. He left in a rage. But when his servants suggested that he do what Elisha said, since it was such a small thing, Naaman ‘swallowed his pride,’ accepted their suggestion and was healed. —2 Ki. 5:1-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both of the suggestions that led to Naaman’s cure were offered by his subordinates, one by his wife’s slave girl and the other by his servants. Yet Naaman obtained lasting benefits by overcoming his pride and accepting from underlings suggestions that appear to have been given out of kindness and concern for a fellow human. So, if in the future someone in your employ or under your direction offers you a suggestion, consider it. Remember Naaman!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is, though, another sphere of life that is often sprinkled with suggestions; that is the family. But sometimes persons who readily accept suggestions at their place of employment are unresponsive to suggestions offered by a family member. One reason for this is that the relationship between business associates is rather formal, and emotions are not usually involved. In contrast, the family relationship involves emotions that can make it more difficult to accept suggestions. Family members may be quite sensitive about their position or duties in the home and so be reluctant to accept suggestions from another member of the family, even though they love that person. But the very fact that the one offering a suggestion is a person they love should make it easier to accept the idea and benefit from it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">For example, a husband is in position to give helpful suggestions to his wife that can result in increased happiness for the entire family. He might learn from talking with her that one of the reasons she is often tired is that she duplicates work, such as going shopping every day. Applying some of the efficient methods he uses at work, he may suggest that she try to do all her shopping in just one or two visits to the market a week. Will she be offended and feel that he is trying to dominate her every movement, or will she appreciate the suggestion and try to apply it as circumstances allow? Application of the suggestion could benefit the wife with more energy for other pursuits, and the husband with a more refreshed and energetic wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other suggestions for the wife could come even from the children. She might mentally take note of the gusto with which they eat a certain meal and wisely decide to prepare it again in the future. Or she could ask the family for suggestions as to what they would like to eat the coming week. Applying their ideas, when possible, will benefit the wife with a more contented family and will ease her chore of trying to prepare an appetizing menu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Looking at the other side of the picture, a wife also could give suggestions to her husband. But when doing so she should remember that the Bible shows that she is to be in subjection to him. (Eph. 5:22, 23) Thus, if she felt that her husband was becoming overweight, she should not proceed to give him orders as to what to do, but she could prepare meals that would assist him to lose weight and, possibly, could make a tactful comment about her reason for doing so. If she did this lovingly, her husband might appreciate the suggestion and improve his health by cooperating. Or a wife might observe a hazard in the home, such as a torn carpet on the stairs, but not be able to repair it herself. If she tactfully mentioned to her husband the need for having it fixed, and if he acted on her suggestion, a severe accident might be averted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to encourage suggestions the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">father could arrange for the entire family to share in a discussion of general family matters. While he, as the head of the household, must make the final decision on many issues, by considering suggestions from his wife and children, he would be prepared to make decisions that would bring the greatest happiness and benefit to his family. In this way the family will be drawn together as a single operating unit instead of each person considering just his own interests. And think what a fine example it will set for the children in being open-minded and reasonable. Yes, the benefits will be many from such suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are you looking for beneficial suggestions? To find them, why not directly ask for them, be observant of other people’s actions and comments, note ideas found in everyday reading and adopt methods that have proved successful to other persons? You will have to be alert and willing to make adjustments in your thinking and actions, but rest assured that you can enjoy increased happiness and success if you will benefit from suggestions.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font7">Why does the Holy Bible make this point? How does it apply to you? </span><span class="font1">in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams.”—1 Sam. 15:15, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah God is not one to let himself be bribed by sac-<sup>rifices</sup>’ <sup>So that </sup>jar &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one could will-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fully neglect God’s other requirements. Otherwise, God might become party to all sorts of wickedness and violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">N</span><span class="font1">O MATTER what a person does to compensate for disobedience, it would have been better if he had obeyed and done what is right, isn’t that so? It certainly is true of the obligations of children toward their parents, and it is true of mankind toward God the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, there are times when children think that they know better than their parents; so they ignore their instructions, perhaps convincing themselves that what they are doing is better. And there are times when individuals set aside the Word of God, ignoring what it has to say, reasoning that what they are doing may result in even greater good. But, really, do youngsters know better than their parents, and do any of us have wisdom that is greater than God’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This point was emphasized to King Saul of Israel, who was commanded by God to execute the Amalekites and to devote to destruction all their animals. But King Saul spared the choicest of the animals, intending to sacrifice them to God—a sacrifice Jehovah had not commanded. King Saul then sought to justify his disobedience on the basis that the spared animals were “for the purpose of sacrificing to Jehovah.” Reproving him, the prophet Samuel said: “Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A Case in Point—The Crusades</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">But men professing to serve God have made that mistake, thereby becoming parties to all sorts of wickedness and violence. How so? Consider an example. When enlisting soldiers for their crusades against the Turks holding the “Holy Land” of Palestine, certain popes of Rome granted those who made the necessary sacrifices to enlist in such crusades “indulgences and temporal privileges, such as exemption from civil jurisdiction, inviolability of persons or lands, etc.”<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">1</a></sup> In other words, those taking part in such crusades not only were supposed to have their sins forgiven, but were freed from accountability to any human government for their actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What were the fruits of tins policy of making sacrifices but not obeying the laws of God and of man? We are told that “seldom does history of profane wars display such scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under the walls of Antioch” by those taking part in the First Crusade. And when these finally took Jerusalem in July 1099, they not only ruthlessly and mercilessly slaughtered 70,000 Moslems, men, women and children, but then herded all the Jews into their synagogue, which they set on fire, burning all the Jews alive. And all this by ostensible soldiers of Christ!—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historian's History</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the World,</span><span class="font1"> Vol. 8, pp. 348, 352.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Fourth Crusade, which was the direct result of the vehement exhortations of Pope Innocent III, never did get to Jerusalem. Instead, it spent all its fury on the Greek Catholic city of Constantinople, regarding which we are told: “The sack of the most civilized city in Christendom ... was incredible.... Havoc and destruction became general. Robber barons, as well as Latin ecclesiastics, in holy orders, shared equally in taking whatever they could carry. . , . Finally the warriors of the Cross committed open rape, adultery and fornication and their violence did not even spare the maidens and virgins vowed to God.’’<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">2</a></sup> Regarding this event, which took place in April 1204, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font1"> tells us: “The holy relics especially excited the covetousness of the Latin [Roman Catholic] clerics.”—Vol. 4, p. 304.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were seven such crusades between the years 1096 and 1270 C.E., and concerning them a modern historian writes: “In short, the Crusades were an exhibition of unbridled, unprincipled, unrestrained savagery in the name of Christ.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Story of Civilization</span><span class="font1"> (1931), G. E. Dorsey, p. 587.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the enlisting in a “holy” cause, fancied or real, can justify disobedience to God’s laws, then men can find justification for any crime.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>A Reiterated Bible Principle</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Under the Mosaic Law, provision was made for sacrifice to atone for one’s sins. Other sacrifices could be offered as an expression of thanks or praise to God. But such sacrifices, to be of any worth, had to be coupled with respect for God’s law. There was no provision by which a person could offer extensive sacrifices to God and so be freed from his obligation to obey the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, at the dedication of the temple of Jehovah, King Solomon offered up 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep, out of his appreciation and zeal for Jehovah’s worship. However, this sacrifice did not relieve Solomon of obeying the first of the Ten Commandments, which states: “You must not have any other gods against my face.” In his old age Solomon failed to obey this law. No matter how many sacrifices he might have offered, they could not relieve him of the obligation to obey that commandment.—Ex. 20:3; 1 Ki. 8: 62-64; 11:4-6,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, indeed, a sacrifice, whether it be optional or required by God, must be coupled with an obedient heart. Fittingly, we find this principle included in the inspired proverbs: “The sacrifice of the wicked ones is something detestable to Jehovah, but the prayer of the upright ones is a pleasure to him.” The wicked are merely deceiving themselves if they think that God will overlook their wickedness because of their offering sacrifices.—Prov. 15:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By means of one prophet after another, God kept reminding his ancient people Israel that sacrifice must be coupled with obedience. The grand prophecy of Isaiah both begins and ends enunciating this principle: “Of what benefit to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? . . . Even though you make many prayers, I am not listening; with bloodshed your very hands have become filled. . .. Learn to do good; search for justice.&quot; Jehovah God says that because “they kept on doing what was bad in my eyes, and the thing in which I took no delight they chose,” he considered their “slaughtering the bull” for sacrifice as the murder of a man.—Isa. 1:11-17; 66:3, 4; Amos 5:22, 24; Jer. 6:13, 15, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pertinent also are the words of Micah: “Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of torrents of oil? ... He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?” (Mic. 6:7, 8) God was not asking only for sacrifices, as if a vast number would forever satisfy him. Apart from justice, kindness and modesty on the part of the worshiper, the sacrifices were not even wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not surprising, then, that Jehovah’s greatest prophet of all, his Son Jesus Christ, repeatedly alluded to the same principle; namely, that sacrifice must be coupled with obedience. Thus, on one occasion, Jesus showed that the religious leaders of his day had made “the word of God invalid” by their tradition of making a sacrifice to God an excuse for not honoring one’s father and mother.—Matt. 15: 5, 6.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Applicable to Christians</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">There is no gainsaying the principle that sacrifice must be coupled with obedience. It is true that Christians are not required to make animal sacrifices to God, nor are even voluntary sacrifices of animals a part of their worship; yet they do offer ‘sacrifices of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that make public declaration to his name.’ (Heb. 13:15) This is required of all who worship Jehovah God; the offering of such sacrifices is a matter of obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet the offering of such sacrifice of praise is of no value if it is not coupled with obedience to others of God’s laws. For instance, there have been some who were very active in the ministry of praise to God’s name, devoting their full time to it and truly sacrificing many things to do this; but they grew lax as to their morals, as though their zeal could compensate for wrongdoing. In the end they were cut off from God’s people. This also happened to some who, after suffering many years in Nazi concentration camps, were excommunicated because of sexual immorality. The apostle Paul was fully aware of this danger, as can be seen by his words: “I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow”; thereby making vain all his sacrifices.—1 Cor. 9:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Others may be moved by a generous heart to make personal sacrifice of a material nature to advance true worship. They contribute generously in a material way, and, as a result, they gain much happiness. (Acts 20:35) However, the making of such sacrifices does not relieve them of the responsibility to obey the commandments of God. For example, they must show love for their neighbor, even as they profess love for God. (1 John 5:2, 3; Jas. 2:8) So the apostle Paul explained, “If I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body, that I may boast, but do not have love, I am not profited at all.” They must share in the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom, doing as Jesus said: “Make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” Thus, sacrifices of a material nature do not eliminate the need for obedience to these Bible commands.—1 Cor. 13: 3; Matt. 28:18-20; 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We cannot escape it. If we would not deceive ourselves, if we would have Jehovah’s approval, we must make certain that our sacrifices are coupled with an obedient heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ifpvATING was such fun, JJ we thought that marriage would be the same,” lamented a disillusioned youngster. Another acknowledged: “We married as boy and girl, but marriage required a man and woman.” And a heartbroken young girl captured the tragedy of her marriage when she explained: “The trouble with my husband and me is that we didn’t give ourselves time to find ourselves. We married before we had any idea what we really were or really wanted—and now we’ve discovered that what we want is certainly not each other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are typical expressions of youths who have been hurt badly in the wake of today’s avalanche of teen-age marriages. The increase of these marriages has been so great that, in the United States, nearly 50 percent of the more than 1,600,000 brides in a recent year were still in their teens. A surprising number of new husbands are also teen-agers. No doubt some of these young couples have made a fine success of their marriages, but can it be said that this is the general ride? Are such young persons prepared to take on the responsibilities of courtship and marriage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The evidence indicates that many are not. Repeatedly, investigations have found that happiness in marriage is found less often in early marriages than in later ones. One investigator, for instance, reported that the “divorce rate was six times higher in the marriages where both spouses were under 21, than in the marriages in which</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19651022_files/g_E_19651022-5.png" alt="" style="width:86pt;height:45pt;">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you prepared to choose a suitable mate? Can you care for the responsibility that marriage brings?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19651022_files/g_E_19651022-6.png" alt="" style="width:168pt;height:123pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">both spouses were 21 or over at the time of marriage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is certainly sobering evidence to consider if you are a teen-ager who wants to get married. It should at least cause you to pause and think the matter over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although it is by no means true everywhere, where you live it may be the custom for a young man or woman to choose one’s own marriage mate. If so, think of the tremendous responsibility: To select a mate with whom you will live day in and day out for the rest of your life!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Prepared to Choose?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">This raises the question as to whether you, as a teen-ager, are in position to choose a marriage mate for the fully developed adult that you will in time become. True, you may have a strong desire to get married, and may even feel that a particular person is the ideal one for you. But have you stopped to analyze why you believe this person will make a fine lifelong partner?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Young people often rate prospective marriage mates according to standards that have little to do with whether they will make good husbands and wives. For example, young girls are often enamored by a star athlete, a smooth dancer, or by a boy with dark curly hair and a sleek-looking automobile. Perhaps you, too, are prone to rate a prospective mate according to values such as these. But are these the things that are really vital to a happy marriage? Is it not of much more importance that a young man have the qualities that will make him a kind, considerate husband, and a faithful provider for the family? Unfortunately, however, the emotions of young girls usually do not permit them to make such an objective assessment of prospective mates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same can be said of young men. Contrary to what many of them seem to think, a girl’s having a pretty face and charming ways does not mean that she will be a dutiful wife, loving mother and an interesting companion. You may be satisfied with just a pretty face now, but later on you will want the qualities of a fully developed woman, including intelligence and ability to shoulder responsibility. Remember, too, with the passing of years bodies and faces change, and the glow of youth that makes some girls so lovely now does not last. So if your choice of a marriage mate is based primarily on such transitory values, the union is not likely to be a happy one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many marriage authorities will not hesitate to point out that the average teenager is not prepared to make such an important choice. And conditions that exist in countries where youths are allowed free rein to select their own marriage mates tend to bear out their contention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In many parts of the world even the teen-agers themselves will readily acknowledge that they are not qualified to select a marriage mate. In fact, for centuries this important choice has largely been left up to parents. As one Indian girl explained to a well-known marriage counselor, Dr. David R. Mace: “How would we be able to judge the character of a boy we met and got friendly with? We are young and inexperienced. Our parents are older and wiser, and they aren't as easily deceived as we would be. . . . It’s so important that the man I marry should be the right one. I could so easily make a mistake if I had to find him for myself.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Sex Attraction and Romance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">What makes a wise selection of a marriage mate especially confusing for inexperienced youth is the powerful attraction that exists between the sexes. When young people, unfamiliar with these forces, are caught up in the clouds of romance they lose all sense of sound judgment. Young girls and boys are thus easily prone to confuse sexual passion with true love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further, where problems or troubles crop up, young couples who are courting often resort to hugging and kissing their way out of them. The trouble may be any one of a number of things—bad habits or mannerisms, differences in likes and dislikes, or conflicting attitudes toward religion or handling of money. But thinking that the wonderful feeling they have for each other will automatically solve such difficulties, they go ahead and get married. This no doubt explains why many teenagers, and even persons out of their teens, are so in love before marriage and so terribly unhappy afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Largely responsible are the modern movies, literature and songs that glamorize romantic love, leaving the impression that it is a sufficient basis for a happy marriage. A girl whose marriage was prompted by such a wrong impression relates: “I was elected Queen of the May and crowned in a gorgeous coronation ceremony. As I stepped down from the stage after being crowned, Don met me at the foot of the stajrs. He asked me for a date, and I agreed to go out with him the next week. On that date he said when he saw me being crowned queen, he knew he loved me.” The twp were quickly married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But rather than living happily ever after, the couple did not get along at all. She said: “He thought my standards foolish and called me highbrow. He really wanted nothing in life beyond a car and a good time. When he hurt me, he never apologized.&quot; The attraction that drew the two together was not genuine, unselfish love. It was sufficient for a pleasurable romance, but not for a happy marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Would it not be wise, then, for you to consider whether sex attraction and romance are the primary reasons you want to marry a certain person? Is it her radiant smile, laughing eyes or beautiful form that make her irresistible to you? Or is it the way that he holds you in his arms and kisses you that makes you certain he is the one for you? If your desire for a person is based almost exclusively on sex appeal, be cautious. Do not confuse this romantic feeling with the type of love needed for a successful marriage.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Ready for Courtship?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The first question to consider, however, is whether you, as a teen-ager, are ready for courtship. In other words, are you in position to take on the responsibilities of married life with which courtship culminates? If not, is there any valid reason for going out alone with persons of the opposite sex and showing interest in them in a way that would naturally be expected to lead to marriage? Is it wise to “date&quot; before you are old enough to get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, if you live in communities where “dating&quot; by even very young persons is the custom, you may see nothing wrong in it. In fact, you may accept it as the natural and proper thing to do. But simply because something is popular, and “everybody does it,” does not mean it is wise. The question is: What is the fruitage of such a custom? Does early unchaperoned dating lead to honorable, successful marriage? Is it good training for youth in eventually choosing a mate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You probably are aware that teen-agers who “date” regularly often get romantically involved and do a lot of necking and petting. What does this often lead to? You know. All too often the girl gets pregnant, and they enter a marriage for which neither is prepared. They did not plan it that way; they may have realized that fornication is wrong, but they lost control of themselves. Sociologists agree that 30 to 40 percent of the teen-age brides in the United States get married because they are pregnant, which means there are now 300,000 to 400,000 teen-age wives who were literally forced into marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even worldly authorities recognize the inadvisability of early dating. Noted the internationally known expert on marriage and family life, Dr. Margaret Mead: “Boys should probably not start courting girls until they have got their growth; until they have some sense of themselves as people; and until a girl a couple of years younger than they are is old enough to be courted.” Unchaperoned dating by young teen-agers simply is not wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rather than being a form of teen-age entertainment, dating and courtship are for mature people who are ready for marriage. It is a time, not for sexual experimentation, but for serious contemplation— when one makes the momentous choice of his lifelong mate. This calls for taking a good, hard, realistic look at the other person, seeing him in as many situations as possible, particularly difficult and unglam-orous ones. Learn what the person is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">reaUy </span><span class="font1">like. Consult your parents. What do they think of the person? Listen to their advice, for generally they are in a much better position to judge qualities of personality than you are.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Responsibility Involved</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">But regardless of whether your parents choose for you or the decision is your own, the question still remains: Are you prepared to care for the responsibility involved? And, too, is the one you plan to marry ready?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unfortunately young persons often have a very unrealistic view of marriage responsibilities. They simply do not know enough about what is involved when two people agree to live together. For instance, do you have a realistic view of what it costs to live? Have you paid your own bills, done your own shopping, handled insurance and taken care of other family matters? It takes training and experience to run a household. Have you had such training?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you are a girl, you may reason that that will be your husband’s responsibility. Well, then, is he qualified to handle such matters? Does he have the necessary experience, or do his parents still support him? If he has never been on his own and taken care of himself, how can you expect him to support both himself and you? Is it wise to entrust yourself into the hands of such inexperience? You will want to determine this </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font1"> getting married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A wife, too, has responsibilities. Are you sure you are ready to care for them? Do you know how to wash, iron, cook, clean the house, and do the many other things that are so necessary for a pleasant home ? True, you may be able to heat a can of beans or put TV dinners in the oven, but can you expect your husband to be happy with a steady diet of such meals? Hardly. To care properly for washing, ironing and cleaning also takes practice and interest. For instance, you can be sure that your husband will not be pleased if he learns that you ruined his new white shirts by putting his colored socks in the same wash with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inexperience can lead to much unhappiness. One young married girl recently admitted: “Like so many girls, I had never learned to cook or keep house. I didn’t even know how to iron a blouse. And Ralph’s mother had always done everything for him; he’d never had to pick up his bath towels or put the toothpaste away.&quot; The two were completely unequipped to handle the everyday responsibilities of married life, and the marriage failed. The same thing can so easily happen to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And what if you should become pregnant? Would you know how to care for yourself during pregnancy, and for the baby after it is born? Or would your feelings be those of the inexperienced teenage wife who explained: “When I first began to realize I might be pregnant, I was shocked. All I could think was, . . . I’ve never held a baby. How can I possibly take care of one?” This is a serious matter, for the early care of a child has a great effect on its well-being in later life. Would your husband be mature enough to meet the situation? Would you feel secure and confident in his care?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are matters for serious consideration, because they are responsibilities that go with marriage. So if you are nearing adulthood and realize that you are not yet equipped to care for the obligations that go with it, now is the time to do something about it. Benefit from the experience that your parents have had; they will be glad to share it with you. Show yourself willing to help with the work that has to be done at home, in this way gaining the training and experience that you will need in years to come. Make the best use of your opportunities now, so that, when you are ready to choose a marriage mate, you will be equipped to contribute your share to a happy home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">BY &quot;AWAKE!&quot; CORRESPONDENT IN SWITZERLAND</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">MY poor head!” “I’m all edgy \_z today!” “There’s such a pressure in the air that I can hardly breathe!” “What’s the matter—I keep making mistakes!” “I know—it must be the foehn!” Someone will look knowingly up into the sky and respond, “Yes, there’s a foehn in the making.” With a sigh of relief all the aches, pains, human inadequacies, tempers and tensions are piled on that old scapegoat as he fills his nostrils, gathers force and blows his way down the valleys of Switzerland. Then we stop and think, “What would we do without the foehn to blame for everything?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To hear us, you might think that Switzerland has a monopoly on the foehn, but not so. Our Austrian neighbors of the Tyrol region share the Alpine foehn with us. Going westward around the globe, we observe that the mountainous terrain of Greenland helps to create winds also called the foehn. Farther to the west, the plains east of the Rocky Mountains in Canada and the United States experience an impressive manifestation of winds similar to the foehn, but there they are called the chi-nook. Nevertheless, whether they are encountered in Switzerland, Greenland or Canada, these winds are a phenomenon to remember.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT THE </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">loehn?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>What Is the Foehn?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">It is a warm, dry wind that pours down one side of a mountain range—in our case the Swiss Alps. In the past it was erroneously thought that the heated air of the Alpine foehn came from the hot Sahara desert, across the Mediterranean Sea, up the Italian side of the Alps, and down into our peaceful Swiss valleys. But with increased scientific understanding of meteorology, study of the atmosphere, and the establishment of weather stations in the Alps, much more is now known about the how’s and why’s of our strange, windy companion, the foehn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What are those how’s and why’s? They involve answers to such questions as, How is it that the coming of the foehn can change the weather from below-zero winter to balmy spring in just twenty-four hours? Why are headaches and discomfort so common when the foehn is here? Why do the mountains appear so picturesquely bright and near on those days? You can answer those questions with just an outline knowledge of the mechanics of the unusual foehn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The buildup comes when the atmospheric pressure is low on the northern side of the Alps and high in the southern region around Italy. The warm, moist air south of the moutains slowly begins to move, creating winds heading toward the low-pressure zone on the other side of the Alps. When they reach the mountains, they are forced to rise, billowing up the ridges and peaks. The moisture condenses over the cooler land of the mountains, and beautiful, lens-shaped clouds are formed. Much of the moisture falls as rain and snow on the Italian side of the mountains. The condensation further warms the moving air. As it descends the northern side of the Alps, the air is additionally heated by compression and flows down the valleys as a mild, arid wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spring foehn brings rain and sometimes floods to the plains of the Po River in Italy and thawing and evaporation to the snow-covered slopes of Switzerland. To some persons it is a terrifying enemy, but to many others it is a magnificent friend.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Why Is It Dreaded?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">You might say, though, “There are winds everywhere. Who has not heard of the trade winds, the oppressive sirocco winds of Sicily and southern Italy, and many others? Why, certain parts of the earth endure hurricanes and cyclones!” Yes, that is all true, but the reputation of the foehn is such that many people consider it second to none in the category of eccentric weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who have never experienced the foehn should not imagine it as just a warm, gentle breeze. Often it is that, but at other times the winds plunge down from the ridges with gale force. At one weather station in Greenland the wind-recording device vanished when the gusts of a foehn wind topped 125 miles an hour. But the speed of the wind continued to increase until the whole weather station was vibrating like a tuning fork in a steady wind estimated at 170 miles an hour. Here in Switzerland the foehn does not attack us with such ferocity, but its force is still something with which to reckon. The roofs of many of the cabins and stables in the mountains have to be weighted down with several rocks that could weigh 70 kg (about 150 pounds) each or more. Even at that, some of the structures come crashing down under the pounding gusts of the foehn. Often trees are uprooted or snapped off with ease by the blasts of wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the warm winds pass over the peaks that are heavily laden with winter snow, quickly the crisp, strong snowfields are converted into weak masses of wet snow. Then begin the dangerous avalanches and slides, transporting tremendous quantities of snow to the lower slopes and sometimes bringing destruction and death. Mountaineers and skiers are warned to keep to the foehn-free areas or to the higher altitudes. So the foehn is not welcomed by those engaged in winter sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For many persons down in the cities the worst thing about the foehn is its effect upon the body. The wind is prevalent from March to May and again in the fall in October and November, though it varies from year to year. When it quickly follows a cold winter season, the sudden rise in temperature and increase in atmospheric pressure bring apathy, exhaustion, dizziness and headaches to some people. In Montana, in the United States, this type of wind once raised the temperature 34° F. within seven minutes. The rapid change produces a physical and emotional strain as the body struggles to adapt to the new weather. Then many will say, “It must be the foehn,” and start to reach for the headache pills. Even members of the animal kingdom are aware when a foehn is brewing. Bees and other insects demonstrate increased irritability, and cows become restless.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Irritation or Blessings?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Let us take time, though, to consider the foehn fairly. Many of the very things about it that cause irritation to some persons are counted by others to be blessings. Numerous individuals are thankful for the foehn and look forward with anticipation to its coming. But why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The snow-melting effect that is a cause of grief to the skier is a source of joy to the Swiss farmer. In March and April, after the heavy snowfalls of winter, the advent of the foehn brings a tremendous change. The warm, dry winds that thirstily lap at the snow have received the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Schneefresser</span><span class="font1"> (snow devourer). Life begins to stir mightily. Where only yesterday, it seems, there was an ocean of snow, today there is a gorgeous field of alpine crocuses. The foehn treats the farmers impartially, clearing the snow from the fields on the shady side of the mountains at the same time that it cleans those on the sunny side. Thanks to the foehn, the tilling can begin early in the year. Because a foot or more of snow can disappear in a few hours under the warm breath of the Chinook wind, ranchers in Alberta, Canada, can graze their cattle in winter areas, where it would be impossible were it not for the foehn-type winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Swiss husbandman welcomes the fall foehn that will aid his grapes to ripen. He even calls it the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Traubenkocher</span><span class="font1"> (grape cooker). In the ‘foehn oasis,’ vineyards can be planted at heights that would be out of the question in areas without the helpful foehn. The warm, dry weather of the foehn produces grapes of superior quality, and naturally the resulting wine is vastly improved. Corn or maize can be cultivated and brought to harvest in northern Alpine valleys of Austria with the aid of the warm foehn. The chestnut trees, a speciality of Ticino to the south, thrive on the ‘foehnoasis’ slopes of Lake Lucerne, growing at altitudes not achieved in surrounding territory lacking the foehn. Yes, the people of these Alpine valleys have good reason to ask, “What would we do without the foehn?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even the wind itself brings benefits to the people of Switzerland. Just prior to the coming of the foehn, atmospheric pressure may keep exhaust fumes near the ground in some of the cities, but when the foehn sweeps down the valleys, stagnant air and smoke are quickly replaced with fresh, clean breezes from the mountains. The wind speedily dries the housewives’ hanging wash, brings joy to the hearts of young boys with their kites, and spreads the seeds of southern flora over the Alps, especially clothing the lower passes with a blanket of glory. With grace and ease the yellow-billed alpine choughs wing their way playfully into the rising air currents, bringing pleasure and wonderment to all who observe them. Even the glider pilot appreciates the power of the foehn as it carries his light craft to exceptionally high altitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If your specialty is photography, you too have good reason to be thankful for the foehn. With the clear foehn air the scenic Alps take on added beauty; they really put on a show! Peaks and ridges, cliffs and crevices, the majestic mountains present scenes of awe-inspiring splendor on every hand. Reflected in the sparkling lakes, the autumn colors of the trees and flowers, with the snow-covered Alps in the background, are subjects for color photography that are unequaled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why, we have made quite a case in favor of that old vagrant of the mountains, to use but one of his uncomplimentary titles. But, no matter how you look at it, just what would we do without the fierce and friendly foehn?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ This experience comes from the state of 7 Washington: “As part of an English class x assignment calling for an oral report on the part of all students, my English teacher, who i knew I was one of Jehovah's witnesses, approached me after class and gave me a special assignment. It consisted of an oral report on Emanuel Swedenborg, spiritist and philosopher of the eighteenth century. He presented me with two of Swedenborg’s philosophical works and asked me to comment x on them in my report. I was greatly helped Z in preparing my report by the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font17"> A article ‘Spirit World Guided Swedenborg.’ 4 My talk covered key points such as whether all religion is good or not, the ransom sacri- </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;4 </span><span class="font17">flee, the false teaching of the immortality £) of the soul and the right understanding of / Jehovah in relation to his Son. My talk lasted 7 fifteen minutes; then questions poured in X for the last forty-five minutes of the period, My classmates seemed amazed to see one oppose false concepts of men and to stand up in defense of Jehovah’s Word. But most amazed of all was my English teacher, him- &lt;&nbsp;self a minister for ten years. The next day X I gave my report in all five of my English jS teacher’s classes, with similar results.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TEACHER USES REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ A Witness in Louisiana tells how she was able to make an effective report: “My Civics teacher told me to select a subject from a list and write a fifteen-page report. I selected the subject of ‘Juvenile Delinquency.’ I went to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index, </span><span class="font17">knowing this would help me find the best material available. After doing much research in the Society's publications, I wrote the report, pointing out, among other things, that the ancient nation of Israel did not have this problem as long as families were closely united in the worship of Jehovah. I gave the report to my teacher. Then the following week he asked the class why they could not write a report like this one. He began reading the report to the class, stopping after every three or four pages to elaborate on what he had read. This went on for a couple of days, then one afternoon he invited another teacher in to listen. This teacher also Wanted to read the report to his classes. The report was returned to me with a big TOO’ marked on the front. When asked where I collected the material, I replied, ‘The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> magazines.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BIBLE STUDY STARTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ At a circuit assembly in Chicago, Illinois, a Witness recently related this experience; “I am in high school and am required to take a course in government. When we came to the subject of civil rights, the teacher asked me if I would give a report on Jehovah’s witnesses. I could have the whole period of fifty-five minutes. Thanks to the Society’s publications, such as the book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,</span><span class="font17"> I was able to give a report, with good results. In fact, I ended up giving my report to all three of my teacher’s government classes. After one of these classes, a girl asked me where she could learn more about Jehovah’s witnesses. Arrangements were made for a sister who goes to school here to study with her. Since neither can stay a full hour, they study on two evenings after school for thirty minutes each. I am happy to be part of Jehovah’s organization that so thoroughly equips us to know how and where to find needed information along with the best way to give it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">17'OR more than twenty years Americans J? debated whether they should adopt a system of compulsory health insurance. Now the matter is settled. For on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare-Social Security bill into law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bill expanded the thirty-year-old Social Security insurance program to provide hospital care, nursing-home care, home nursing services and out-patient diagnostic services for all Americans sixty-five years of age and older. It also set up a supplementary program of Federal insurance covering doctors’ bills and some other health costs of persons in this age-group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now that medicare is law in America, just what does it cover? How much will it cost the average taxpayer? How does the American program compare with the health services of other nations? Why did many American doctors oppose the plan?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Plan at a Glance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Who is going to benefit by medicare? Those eligible for, benefits are all persons sixty-five years old and over, with a few exceptions. For example, aliens with less than five years of residence in the United States, also aliens without status as permanent residents and Federal employees eligible for government health insurance under another law are </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> embraced by the medicare law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Insurance is provided under two plans: one known as “basic” and the other as “supplementary.” Both plans become operative July 1, 1966.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Basic Plan</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The basic plan automatically covers those who are sixty-five years old and over, with the aforementioned exceptions. It applies regardless of income. It benefits people still working, as well as the retired. A person qualifies whether covered by Social Security or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Benefits under the basic plan include hospitalization up to ninety days for each spell of illness. The patient pays the first $40 of hospital costs. After sixty days, he pays $10 a day up to the ninety-day limit. Under the plan a spell of illness starts with the first day of hospitalization and ends when the patient has spent sixty consecutive days without hospital or nursing care after being discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Benefits cover cost of semiprivate room and board, plus usual hospital services such as nursing, drugs and supplies. Not covered are fees for most surgery, a private doctor or a private nurse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nursing-home care, effective in 1967, will be provided for up to a hundred days in each illness but only after a stay of at least three days in a hospital. The patient pays nothing for the first twenty days in the nursing home. Thereafter he pays $5 daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another benefit is home nursing up to a hundred visits by nurses or technicians in a one-year period following the patient’s discharge from a hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tests and related diagnostic services that are normally provided by hospitals to outpatients will also be available. The patient, however, will pay $20 of the charge for each diagnostic study by the same hospital in a twenty-day period. The patient also pays 20 percent of the charges above $20, and medicare covers the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are just some of the major provisions of the “basic&quot; plan.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Supplementary Plan</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The supplementary plan will be available on a voluntary basis, with participants paying $3 a month in premiums. Social Security pensioners who enroll in this plan, may, if they wish, arrange to have their $3 premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security checks. This may be arranged at the time of enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This plan supplements the basic plan by covering most other major medical expenses, except those for dental services, medicines and drugs. It covers physicians’ fees, including surgery, whether performed in or away from a hospital. It also takes care of charges for various services and supplies, such as X ray, radiological treatments, surgical dressing, whether provided in or out of a medical institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the $3-a-month premium, a participant in the supplementary plan pays $50 of his annual costs for the services and supplies covered. He also pays 20 percent of the yearly cost above $50.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>How Financed?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Who will pay for the basic plan in medicare? This plan will be financed by increases in the Social Security payroll taxes over the next twenty-two years, starting January 1, 1966. The tax, shared equally by employers and employees, is now </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11 </span><span class="font1">percent. Under the bill, the combined employer-employee rate is scheduled to rise in seven steps to 11.3 percent in 1987.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1950 Americans spent about $12,000,000,000 on health; immediately prior to the passing of the medicare law the figure was more than $33,000,000,000. With medicare this figure is expected to rise considerably. The average manufacturing worker now makes $5,600 a year. His Social Security taxes will go up $60 next year. In 1964, half of all American workers had earnings of about $5,200. The Social Security tax of these wage earners will go up next year about $55. So for the bulk of the working population, the Social Security tax increase will be no small matter. There will be some loss of purchasing power. But those over sixty-five will experience some gain.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>What Medicare Does Not Do</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Despite the heavy cost , medicare’s basic plan does </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> do many things. It does not cover the doctor’s bill, or bills for drugs, except when these are supplied by a hospital. Nor does the plan cover dental bills, the buying of eyeglasses, hearing aids or artificial limbs. And, of course, it does not apply to anyone under sixty-five years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here are some examples to help you see what the basic plan will and will not do. For example, a man, 65, ruptures himself. He calls the family doctor, who consults a surgeon, who sends the man to a hospital. Except for a small charge, medicare pays all the hospital bill, but does not pay for the family doctor, the surgeon or any of the drugs that the man might have to take after leaving the hospital. If the man had enrolled in the supplementary plan and had paid his $3 a month premium, this plan would cover the bills from his doctor and the surgeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Say a man seventy-two years old has fainting spells. A friend calls a doctor. The doctor suggests that he go to a hospital for observation. The man prefers to be treated at home. All the doctor’s fees must be paid by the patient, unless, of course, he is a participant in the supplementary plan. Then these bills would be covered. However, had he agreed to hospitalization, the hospital bill and the diagnostic service would have been covered by medicare under the basic plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A young couple, for example, with two children try to care for the wife’s grandmother, who is eighty. The wife feels the strain, but they cannot afford a maid or a nurse. They place the grandmother in a nursing home. The couple call on medicare to help pay the cost. Their appeal is rejected. They are told that under the basic plan only after a patient has been released from a hospital to a nursing home does medicare apply. Since the grandmother was not hospitalized, medicare does not apply. The couple, or some other agency, must pay the nursing-home bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A seventy-year-old retired carpenter enters a hospital for a cancer operation. He remains in the hospital a full year, and then dies. Medicare pays, within its provisions, only during the first three months. As outlined in the plan it covers a maximum of ninety days in the hospital, with the patient paying a part of that bill. The final nine months must be paid for by his estate, his family, or some other agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A diabetic, in his seventies, applies to medicare for help in purchasing drugs and medicines that he must take the rest of his life. His appeal is turned down. Medicare does not supply medicine under the basic plan except to patients hospitalized. The supplementary plan would cover this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How, then, is medicare a saving? A hospital bill of $7,300 could be covered by medicare and the supplementary plan to the extent of $6,000 and more, leaving the patient with only a $1,300 bill. But an accurate estimate is impossible to arrive at because of varying circumstances and costs in each case. Much depends on location, hospital and services rendered. Nevertheless, there definitely are savings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since medicare benefits do not become available until July 1, 1966, insurance experts bid the elderly to keep up their present insurance policies.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Health Plans of Other Nations</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">How does the United States medicare plan compare with the health services of other nations? Today it is claimed that some sixty nations provide medical care for their people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On July 5, 1948, some 50,000,000 people, alien residents and tourists in the United Kingdom, were given access to various kinds of medical care under the British National Health Service (NHS). The present system is compulsory for everyone. There is no age limit, and it is available to both alien residents and citizens. On occasions people in need of expensive surgery have flown to Britain, the cost of the flight being less than the cost of the operation in their own country. The British believe their system has won them many friends, and no doubt it has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The average Englishman pays about £30 ($84) each year for his social security, which includes £8 each year toward the NHS. Only 4 percent of the NHS’s income is from fees paid by patients using the Service. Drug costs are not levied on hospital patients. The patient pays 2 shillings (about 28c) for each item prescribed, regardless of its cost. Dental treatment is free to children and expectant mothers. The rest pay a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other nations have similar health plans, which for all practical purposes embrace all the people. However, the manner in which the plans are financed may differ slightly in each country. Some health services are a part of a nation’s social security arrangement; others are embraced by industrial or farmers’ insurance or other agencies. The systems as a rule are quite complex. But they do ensure that no individual need bankrupt himself as a result of his own or his family’s ill health.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Doctors’ Opposition to Medicare</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Why did many American doctors oppose medicare? Dr. George M. Fister, president of the American Medical Association, a 200,000-member association, which represents 90 percent of the practicing physicians in America, stated, in 1963, that he believed that the medicare plan was “detrimental to the public welfare.” He also believed that medicare would “seriously undermine professional freedom.” “Doctors want to be free to give their patients the best medical care they are capable of giving,” Fister said. “With few exceptions, they are convinced that only if medicine remains a free institution can it serve the people of America to the limits of its capacity.” Fister claimed that the government-controlled health-care programs would be wasteful and unnecessary and at the same time potentially harmful to the nation’s health. Of course, time will tell whether these fears were justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shortly after the signing of the medicare bill, the Association’s executive vicepresident, Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame, said: “We were fighting a legislative battle, as was our right. Now that it’s become law, it’s up to the individual physician to decide” whether he wants to oppose the medicare plan or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some doctors fear that medicare will mean control. The medicare law, they believe, has placed the government in position to impose and enforce arbitrary rules and regulations governing the administration and the practice of medicine in the nation’s hospitals and it has made it possible for government men to make medical decisions affecting the health of 18,000,000 of its aged citizens. This, many doctors do not like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is obvious that the American medicare plan will not solve every aspect of the nation’s health problems, not even for those over sixty-five. It does not and cannot guarantee good medical care to all its citizens, not even to its beneficiaries. The extent to which the good that it promises becomes a reality will depend, not only on what is set out in the law, but also in large measure on the spirit manifest by those who administer it.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Youthful Smokers</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• New York City educators have estimated that up to 50 percent of that city’s high school seniors are smokers, and that 10 percent are beginning to smoke at age fifteen. New York City girls apparently smoke almost as frequently as do boys. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(Young People and Smoking,</span><span class="font17"> Dr. Arthur H. Cain, p. 56) A report of the British Health Ministry indicates that 3 percent of Britain’s pupils who are seven years of age are habitual smokers. A poll taken among thirteen- to fifteen-year-old smokers showed that, on an average, they formed the habit at nine years of age. Of those graduated from school more than half are smokers. Health experts have been seriously considering how they can most effectively call the dangers of smoking to the attention of youth still in school. Obviously nrueh of the responsibility must lie with the parents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awok*l&quot; correspondent in the Netherlands Antilles</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SIGN that is common to homes the world over appears in three languages here in Curasao in the Netherlands Antilles. In Dutch, Papiamento and English, visitors are warned, “Beware of the Dog!” Some signs add emphasis to the warning by stating: “He bites.” Still others have a picture of a tierce-looking dog on it, but this usually is unnecessary because the dog is at the gate, giving meaning to the sign. If he is not, he will probably be standing on the “welcome” mat in front of the door glowering at you in a most unwelcoming manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dogs may be a joy to their owners, but to mailmen, milkmen, meter readers and other persons engaged in work that requires them to call at the homes of people, they can be an unpleasant problem. Thousands of mailmen in the United States alone are prevented from completing their appointed rounds by unfriendly dogs. In fact, in 1963 approximately 7,000 mailmen were bitten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In areas where thievery is commonplace, householders have a good reason for keeping a watchdog in the yard. In Curasao a watchdog is regarded as a working dog. This was made very evident when a visitor to a home asked the householder, “Does your dog bite?” The reply: “Sure he does; that's his work.” In the tropics, windows and doors are left open to let in any breeze there might be. So a watchdog is kept in the yard to discourage thieves from being tempted to enter the house. Some thieves are so bold that they even try to get in during daylight hours unless there is a dog in the yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A dog does not necessarily have to be vicious to scare off thieves. One that will bark noisily at strangers can often accomplish as much and not be a threat to innocent visitors. Of course, some fearful persons feel more secure if they have a real watchdog around the house to protect them. Others have dogs, not for the purpose of protection, but because they like pets. Although such dogs may not be a threat to persons calling at the house, they may cause visitors to be hesitant about approaching the door.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>What to Do When Confronted by a Dog</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Oftentimes a visitor approaches a house that has no warning sign and finds a dog in the yard. If you were such a visitor, what would you do? When a dog shows no indications of being dangerous, the best thing to do is to ignore it and walk up to the house as if you owned the place. If you are in doubt about the dog, you would be wise to determine whether the dog is friendly before you go too far into the yard. You might give a whistle or speak quietly to it in a low and friendly tone. If the dog is friendly, it will usually respond by wagging its tail, laying back its ears and barking a little once in a while. If it is suspicious, it will probably continue staring at you and perhaps bark. A dangerous dog will growl low in its throat and try to get behind you to attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Never hold out your hand to a suspicious or unfriendly dog, as it may resent your familiarity. If you have children with you, do not permit, them to pet, embrace or even approach a strange dog. Children usually do not realize that strange dogs may not be as friendly toward them as is their own dog, and they may be severely bitten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon being faced with a growling dog that does not retreat, you had better think about retreating yourself. Do not be ashamed to yield ground to such a dog, but do so slowly. Never run, as that would invite immediate attack. A mail carrier will put his big leather- bag between himself and the dog, so if you have a briefcase, it would be well for- you to do that too. As the dog circles you, keep facing it. Do not permit it to get behind you. If you do, it will sink its teeth into your leg. Avoid making sudden moves, as that might startle the dog and cause it to attack. Back slowly out of the yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kicking the dog or throwing something at it is not a wise thing to do, as that may make the dog think it is being attacked. Some mailmen spray a noninjurious chemical in a menacing dog’s face with good results, but this is liable to antagonize the dog’s owner. In order to maintain good relations with a householder, the best thing to do is to retreat slowly from a menacing dog, warding off any attempt it may make to attack you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When you come to a home that has a sign warning: “Beware of the Dog!” should you heed it or ignore it? Some people have a sign but no dog. Others may have a sign but nothing more than a harmless poodle, while still others actually do have a snarling watchdog. It is best to be a cautious visitor under- such circumstances, rattling the gate, calling out, whistling or scraping your feet to make your presence known. If a dog is running loose in the yard, such noises should bring it running and barking to the gate. You can then look at it and evaluate your chances of reaching the door of the house without getting bitten. In many instances, however, just the barking of the dog will be sufficient to bring the householder into the yard, where you can speak with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, it is unnerving to venture into a yard when no dog responds to the rattling of the gate and find that the dog was sleeping and did not hear you until you rang the doorbell. Then the dog may come bounding around the corner of the house and stand growling between you and the gate. If no one is at home, you now have the difficult problem of trying to get back safely to the gate, which the dog may not want you to do. The only thing you can do is to try to edge past the dog, being careful to face him all the time.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>When Bitten</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">A dogbite can become a serious matter if the dog has rabies. For this reason doctors recommend immediate treatment. In countries where pets are required to be vaccinated for rabies, there have been very few cases of people getting rabies from dogbites. In fact, there was only one known case of death from rabies in the United States in 1964, and this was a ten-year-old boy who was bitten by a rabied skunk while sleeping in a tent. Although he was given the usual rabies vaccine, he died in a little more than twenty days. His brother, who also was bitten and who was given the vaccine, showed no symptoms of the disease. In the Netherlands, however, rabies in dogs caused a number of deaths in 1964, and in Venezuela there were eighty-two from 1956 to 1960. If a bite breaks the skin, it is best to get treatment promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Once a dog has bitten someone, it usually is put on record as a vicious dog. The owner will be held responsible for any future attacks. Of course, the circumstances are usually taken into consideration, and if the dog bites someone while fulfilling its duty as a watchdog its actions will not necessarily be held against it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Consideration for Legitimate Visitors</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Mailmen, milkmen, meter readers and other persons who have a legitimate reason for coming onto a person’s property in broad daylight must be protected from the dog by the owner. It is his obligation to safeguard legitimate visitors to his home. Having a sign warning people to beware of the dog does not necessarily relieve him of liability, but his legal responsibilities in this respect will vary from one community to another. In Curasao a dog owner is responsible for damage done by his dog even in his own yard if the gate is not locked. If he knows that his dog bites, he is obligated to keep it tied or muzzled. Putting up a sign &quot;Beware of the Dog!” implies that he knows that his dog is dangerous, making him even more responsible for its actions. If he should command his dog to bite someone because of spite or malice and not because of being threatened with attack, he would, in many places, be guilty of assault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States a mailman that is threatened by a dog is not required to leave mail at that house. He can return it to the post office, where the dog owner must go to get it. Mail delivery might even be suspended to that house until the dog owner provides protection for the mailman. In view of the difficulties and legal problems a dog can cause, a dog owner has good reason to provide protection for legitimate visitors to his house. This can be done in a number of ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A bell could be placed on the gate that enters into the yard where a watchdog is roaming about. By means of it the legitimate visitor can summon the householder without having to risk being bitten. The dog could be kept chained, if a bell is not feasible, or kept in a fenced-off section during the day and then allowed to run freely about the yard at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even if the law in your country does not favor the dog and its owner, it is best to be cautious when approaching a house where there is a dog. Some dog owners, it is true, may show little or no consideration for legitimate visitors to their home; but suing a dog owner is poor consolation for the nervous upset and injury caused by a dogbite. So take reasonable precautions when you see the sign “Beware of the Dog!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">KEEPING THE EARTH CLEAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• On one occasion, in Kenya, George G. Goodwin, associate curator of mammals, the American Museum of Natural History, checked the time it took for a dead animal to be disposed of. He writes: “Five minutes after a zebra had been shot and killed, the first scout vulture came. In ten minutes there were thirty vultures feeding on the zebra, and twenty minutes later only the bones and the hide remained. About this time—it was late in the evening—two hyenas located the kill. By next morning nothing was left of the dead zebra.”—</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Animal Kingdom,</span><span class="font17"> Frederick Drimmer, editor in chief, Vol 1, pp. 550, 551.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">O</span><span class="font1">N THE land, in the air and even in the deep depths of the oceans living creatures have for millenniums been producing their own light. And what a wonder these living lanterns are! In the average electric light bulb, for example, only about 3 percent of the electrical energy goes into visible light, most of the rest is lost in heat; but the Creator’s living lanterns are virtually 100 percent efficient! Therefore, their light production, referred to as bioluminescence, is also accurately termed “cold light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the best known of these living lanterns are the so-called fireflies, or lightning bugs, and their larvae which are called glowworms. They are not really flies at all, but a group of beetles with a special built-in, light-producing system. On warm summer evenings people in many parts of the earth watch in fascination as these zooming live sparks flare, go out, and flare again. It is now generally accepted that these are lights of love, being used as communication signals between the males in the air and the females concealed in the grass below.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Lanterns of Various Lands</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">In Japan fireflies are greatly appreciated, and firefly festivals form a part of Japanese tradition. Fireflies are sometimes released to beautify restaurant gardens, or to brighten the scene for an outside party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A most remarkable spectacle witnessed in parts of Thailand, Burma and other countries of southeast Asia is the rhythmic</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">flies congregate in certain trees, and they all flash on and off in unison, as if operated by an electric switch. What a wonder to see whole trees sparkling with light! Although it has not been established for a certainty, it is thought that the fireflies in one tree may be all males, and those flashing in unison nearby, but out of step with those in the first tree, may be all females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another living lantern that certainly excites wonderment is the cucujo beetle of the West Indies. Two brilliant spots of greenish luminescence are located near the head, and on the underside a powerful yellow light shines intermittently in flight. This is one of the brightest lights of any insect, and in flight is likened by witnesses to a shooting star. It is reported that native girls used to tie these inch-long beetles to their feet to illuminate their path at night. Girls use them today as living jewels, attaching them at night to their hair or dress. It is even claimed that, during the Spanish-American War, a Dr. William C. Gorgas performed a surgical operation from the light of a bottleful of them when his lamp failed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But perhaps an even more fascinating living lantern is the Central and South American beetle commonly called the “rail</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">flashing of thousands of fireflies. The fireroad worm,” because it looks so much like</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a lighted train. The </span><span class="font1">larvae, which are sometimes as long as two inches, and the adult female are the luminous forms. The larvae are decorated with pairs of bright greenish-white lights that form two parallel rows running down their sides, plus a big red light on their heads. The side lights are operated in pairs, so at any one time a varying number of them may be on, or all of them can be switched on and off at once. The bright red head light is operated independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Across the Pacific Ocean in New Zealand, living lanterns in certain caves make one of the most spectacular sights seen by man. From the ceilings of these caves, notably the one at Waitomo, hang glowing larvae that are said to rival even the Milky Way in beauty. In the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Strangest Creatures on Earth</span><span class="font1"> one visitor writes of people who have seen many natural wonders in scores of lands, “but none of us could recall anything possessing the same breathtaking impact of sheer loveliness as the glowworm grottoes of the Waitomo Caves, 200 miles north of Wellington.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These glowworms can keep their bluish-green lantern lighted continuously or can dim or extinguish it. A British biologist, F. W. Edwards, describes the wondrous sight: “Our wanderings deep underground brought us to the edge of a pool. The guide made a speech about the glowworms which adorned the roof over the water, pointing out the long, glistening cobweb threads let down singly by each worm that dangled from it. Vibrations of air carried by talking or sound of shuffling paper affected the worms, which thereupon put out their lights. After due admonition to keep quiet and to leave all maps behind so they wouldn’t rustle, we tiptoed in single file down to a lower level. . . . Then, putting out all our lights, we gradually became aware that a vision was silently breaking on us. ... A radiance became manifest which absorbed the whole faculty of observation—the radiance of a mass body of glowworms as cannot be found anywhere in the world, utterly incalculable as to numbers and merging their individual lights in a nirvana of pure sheen.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Lighting the Living Lanterns</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Do you wonder how these living lanterns are lit, and how they are turned on and off? This has been a question that has puzzled humans for thousands of years. In the past eighty years, however, man has learned a great deal about the substances involved in bioluminescence. Back in 1887 the French physiologist Raphael Dubois identified the light-causing material and called it luciferin, a name he coined from Lucifer, meaning shining one or light bearer. Another substance, which acts as a catalyst, enabling the luciferin to unite with oxygen to produce light, is an enzyme Dubois called luciferase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both of these materials are contained in the fireflies’ myriad of microscopic light cells. Minute tubes supply the necessary oxygen to these cells to make possible the combustion that produces light. Interestingly, if luciferin and luciferase are extracted from fireflies and are united together, they will produce a flash of light, but only one. After that, the mixture is unable to light again. However, when another substance, adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for short, is added, the luciferin is regenerated and will flash as often as it is empowered by ATP. This substance is a high-energy compound found in the muscles of all living things, including man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chemical energy apparently, therefore, is what revitalizes the luciferin after each flash and makes it ready to flash again, However, there is no agreement as to how this flash is triggered or controlled. And neither is it fully understood just what delicate chemistry is responsible for the resulting glow. Man yet has much to learn concerning the light of the living lanterns of creation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Lanterns in the Depths</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the most fascinating of these living lanterns are in the depths of the oceans, and some of them man has only learned about in recent years. One small deepwater Mediterranean squid produces a luminous secretion that completely envelops the owner in a cloud of fire. The depthdwelling angler fish is equipped with a long filament protruding from its foreparts, at the end of which hangs a lure of other tiny filaments. These lures of some anglers are luminescent, perhaps an aid in attracting smaller living creatures for food. Mention should also be made of California’s “singing fish,” which may possess nearly 800 light organs in its sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Luminous fish of the depths are generally comparatively small, around four to ten inches, and they have huge eyes that can pick up the dimmest pinpoint of light. Each kind of these deep-dwelling fish wears the same number of lights, making it possible for them to recognize one another in the dark. These lights do not remain on continuously, but are under the control of the fish and can be lit up or turned off at will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are also lanternbearing creatures closer to the surface or in shallower water. For example, seagoing passengers on ships at night have frequently observed great sparkling balls of light on the water’s surface. This was probably a party of jellyfish in evening dress. Some form of direct stimulus of either a mechanical, chemical or electrical nature causes the jellyfish to secrete luciferin through glands, with the beautiful light-yielding result. Here is one of creation’s electrical signboards wearing light as an external garment.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19651022_files/g_E_19651022-12.png" alt="" style="width:119pt;height:141pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Though not always so spectacular as this, all light producers do have their gift of glamor. Sea pens and sea pansies, very simple animal forms dwelling on the ocean floors, are relatives of the jellyfish, with the same luminous traits. A sea pen near Japan is known to rise erect at night after a day of groveling on its “face.” In its splendor it then emits a luminous slime from its outer surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another interesting luminescent creature is a water flea found in the seas of the Orient. At night it emerges from the sand and secretes a luminous mucus as it moves about. Even after these creatures die, their dried bodies, when ground into a powder and mixed with water, will produce light. During World War II, Japanese soldiers used them as a source of low-intensity light when they did not want to risk using a flashlight. A small quantity of the powder placed in the hands and moistened provided enough light for reading a map or a message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wondrous creatures indeed are the many varieties of living lanterns! Truly, with respect to the light of these living lanterns the Great Lightmaker, Jehovah God, has created a wonder, about which man yet has much to learn.</span></p><img src="g_E_19651022_files/g_E_19651022-13.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:117pt;">
<p><span class="font5">E</span><span class="font1">VERY day multitudes qf religious people raise their voices in prayer to persons whom they regard as saints. They sincerely believe that these persons, long dead,' can intercede for them with God. Those who are thought to be saints were often martyrs and persons officially proclaimed as saints by religious organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font1"> James Cardinal Gibbons expressed the Roman Catholic view regarding prayers to saints when he said: “When we address the saints, we beg them to pray for us through the merits of Jesus Christ, while we ask Jesus to help us through his iown merits. . . . By Invoking their intercession, instead of one we have many praying for us. To our own tepid petitions we unite the fervent supplications of the blessed and ‘the Lord will hear the prayers of the just.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is true that the prayers of righteous persons that are offered to God through Jesus Christ are heard, and the Scriptures give many examples where such persons prayed in behalf of others. Abraham, for example, prayed in behalf of Abimelech, Job for his critical “comforters,” and Moses for wayward Israelites. In the days of the apostles, Christians frequently prayed for one another. On one occasion the apostle Paul asked the congregation of Thessa-lonica to “carry on prayer for us, that the word of Jehovah may keep moving speedily.” (2 Thess. 3:1) Praying for the welfare of others is a Scriptural practice. But is there not a difference between having living persons pray in your behalf and praying to dead persons to do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the eyes of the apostles of Jesus Christ, the practice was not the same, because there is no record of their praying to dead holy men such as the highly respected prophets Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah and Jeremiah. And yet they encouraged Christians to pray for one another. If they had thought that praying to righteous men who had died was the thing to do, would they not have prayed to Elijah, Elisha and other prophets whose prayers God had answered during their lifetime? Is it not significant that the apostles asked no one that had died to intercede for them with God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the reasons they did not is the Scriptural statement at Ecclesiastes 9:5, which says that, as for “the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” Their being conscious of nothing would make prayers to them useless, would it not? At Psalm 146:4, it is pointed out that, when a person dies, “his thoughts do perish,” How can a dead person without thoughts hear your prayers, much less frame a prayer of intercession for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prayer to saints is based upon the assumption that man has an immortal soul that continues his conscious existence after death, but instead of confirming this view the Scriptures frankly state that “all have sinned” and that &quot;the soul that is sinning —it itself will die.” (Rom. 3:23; Ezek. 18: 4) So, rather than being immortal, the human soul dies and ceases to be conscious of anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is true that the apostles hoped in a resurrection of the dead, trusting God’s promise to raise some persons to life as spirit creatures. The apostle Paul speaks of this hope at 1 Corinthians 15:42-44. Although such resurrected persons are privileged to rule with Christ in the heavens, there is not even a suggestion in the Bible that prayers should be directed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prayer is effectual only when it is in harmony with divine instructions regarding it. If it is presented for a wrong purpose, for example, it is not heard, as the Bible writer James points out: “You do ask, and yet you do not receive, because you are asking for a wrong purpose.” (Jas. 4:3) It is likewise ineffective if it is presented in the wrong manner. As pointed out at Isaiah 8:19, praying to dead persons is not the manner God has approved. “In case they should say to you people: ‘Apply to the spiritistic mediums or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping and making utterances in low tones,’ is it not to its God that any people should apply? Should there be application to dead persons in behalf of living persons?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But what about those Christians that have been resurrected to immortal spirit life and are associated with Christ in the heavens? Would it not be effectual to pray to them to make intercession with God for us? On the surface that might seem a wise thing to do, but in actual fact it is praying in a wrong manner, because the Scriptures specifically point out that no one but Jesus Christ can be a mediator between us and God. Jesus said this himself when he was on earth. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) Also Paul, an apostle of Christ, said: There is one God, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">one mediator</span><span class="font1"> between God and men, a man Christ Jesus.”—1 Tim. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inasmuch as Christ Jesus is the only mediator between man and God, we are Scripturally required to approach God in prayer through him alone. That is the right manner of praying. Nowhere do the Scriptures command that we make our petitions to God, the Father, in the name or through the mediatorship of anyone but Jesus Christ, his Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Venerating other persons popularly known as “saints” is just as wrong as praying to them. Jesus pointed this out when he said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matt. 4:10) When the apostle John attempted to worship an angel, he was rebuked by the angel, who said: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus. Worship God.” (Rev. 19:10) Certainly if a mighty angel refused adoration and insisted on being regarded as just a fellow slave of God, would not Christi</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ans </span><span class="font1">that have been resurrected from the dead and given life as spirit creatures likewise reject veneration if it were directed to them? Like the angel, they would not want to be adored and prayed to, for that is not the manner of worshiping and praying that God has laid out for us. They would, instead, want to be treated like Christian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When persons in ignorance pray to images of saints, as if the image itself had special power, they compound their mistake. Just as an unresurrected dead person has no consciousness and is unaware of persons that pray to him, so an image of a saint cannot hear prayers. Note what Psalm 135:16, 17 says: “A mouth they have, but they can speak nothing; eyes they have, but they can see nothing; ears they have, but they can give ear to nothing.” (In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font1"> this is Psalm 134.) What good, then, are prayers directed to such images? They fall on deaf ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With a keen desire to have our prayers heard by God, we should sincerely strive to present them in the manner he approves. The only way of approach to him in prayer is in the way he has opened and that is through Jesus Christ. No one else can intercede for us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp; In </span><span class="font17">Cairo, in early August, it was held that marriage between a Moslem girl and a Communist would be null and </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">void in </span><span class="font17">the eyes of the Islamic religion. Since Islam bans marriage of a Moslem girl to a polytheist (that is, a member of Christendom who believes in the trinity), how could it permit the marriage of a Moslem girl to an atheist who de</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">nies </span><span class="font17">the presence of God? the Legal Opinion Committee of Al Azhar University asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope and the U.N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Pope Paul VI is scheduled to deliver a peace appeal before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on October 4. He is also to conduct a public mass in New York's Yankee Stadium, and then return to Rome the same day. This historic first trip to American soil by a Roman Catholic pope has caused many to see the Roman Catholic leader’s close affiliation with the political heads of the world. In this role many view the pope as a politician and not as a vicegerent of Christ, for Jesus Christ said that his followers would be “no part of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">People’s War</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Communist China’s Defense Minister Lin Piao in a major declaration on September 3 called upon Leftist revolutionaries to strike against United States’ forces without fear of nuclear retaliation. The American “colossus,” he asserted, could be defeated “piece by piece” by what he termed “people’s wars” in Asia, Africa and Latin America. How can the seeds of peace take root in such soil?</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; For the first time in Chile and, it is said, in all of Latin America a Roman Catholic cardinal spoke in a Jewish synagogue on a purely religious theme. Chile's cardinal, Radi Silva Henriquez, also archbishop of Santiago, gave a discourse on &quot;The Respect to the Human Person in the Old Testament” to a crowded synagogue in Santiago the last week of July, This new attitude, he saidj was due to the new criterions arising from the Ecumenical Council in Rome. Commenting on the discourse, Rabbi Lowenstein stated: “I make bold to say that not much time will pass before we will be integrated at last in a Jewish-Christian brotherhood which, of course, will in no way affect the principles of either.” How could this be true? Is it that both groups are willing to put the traditions and philosophies of men above the Holy Bible?</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Identical Triplets Born</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The miracle of birth seems to compound itself when twins or triplets are born, and even more so when identical births take place. The odds of a woman giving birth to identical triplets are said to be a million to one. On September 3 Mrs. Carmen Plaza, 24, of New York, proved to be the one in a million. She gave birth to identical girl triplets. For the purpose of identification the babies at the hospital were called A, B and C, because the surprised parents had as yet no names for them. All the father could say is that he was “very excited.” Little wonder!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Thoughts on Church Union</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some who have been swept along in the popular enthusiasm for church mergers* are having second thoughts about the matter. In late August in Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria, 5,000 Methodists passed a resolution declaring that they did not think it wise to join such a movement until the purpose and details of the movement had been fully explained and accepted by all concerned. Although a decision had earlier been made that they would participate, they asked that it be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Occupation in Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; A published United Press International dispatch tells of a Londoner wanting a telephone, but he saw no reason why he should tell the phone company his occupation in order to get one. So in the space marked occupation, he wrote: &quot;Thief.” &quot;Owing to your rather precarious position,” the company replied, &quot;we must ask you to pay a deposit of $280 before we install a phone. Then you won't steal it.” The man rapidly reconsidered. Ue changed his listed occupation and the phone was installed for the standard $28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Teen-Age Syphilis</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;§■ Venereal disease among teen-agers in America has risen 230 percent in recent years despite the use of modern miracle drugs. In the 20- to 24-year age-group, syphilis was up 267 percent. Other figures for the lower age-groups resulted in the average of 230 percent. Death from syphilis was also increasing generally. The trend was not confined to any race, sex or geographic area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Infiltration Warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; John Newington, in the Rhodesian parliament this summer, stated that he believed Communists were infiltrating Christendom’s churches in Rhodesia. He said that Christianity had survived, not because of the established church or its leaders, but because of Christ. “I would go so far as to say that Christ has survived despite the Church and the antics of some of its leaders. When I sec a bishop, at a cocktail party, with his silks rustling in the comfort of luxurious surroundings and worldly material wealth, I am reminded of the Christ whom they are supposed to be following, who had nowhere to lay his head.” The report claimed that there was ample evidence of Communist infiltration in the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Dope Peddlers Warned</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Soviet Union has made it a criminal offense to entice youths under eighteen to drunkenness or narcotics addiction. The move was made to curb an upsurge of juvenile delinquency in Russia. Under the law, it is also a crime to grow or cultivate Manchurian or Central Asian hemp. Violators can receive a three-year sentence for growing the hemp, while those inducing minors to drunkenness can get a jail sentence of .five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking and Illicit Sex</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">According to a three-year study of teen-agers in England and Wales, it has been established that there is a relationship between cigarette smoking and illicit sex activity among boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 19. Reports on the study of some 1,900 young people showed that by the age of 18, 34 percent of the boys and 17 percent of the girls have had sexual experience. &quot;Practically all the girls who smoked more than 20 a day and half the boys who smoked that number were sexually experienced,” the report said. What is the connection? Both smokers and fornicators have little regard for human life, whether their own life that they endanger with disease or that of their potential offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A Quiet Throng</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An overflow crowd of 74,649 Jehovah’s witnesses and their friends jammed Yankee Stadium in New York on August 29 to close their six-day “Word of Truth” convention. The throng listened quietly to Nathan H. Knorr, president of the Watchtower Society, speak about mankind’s only hope —the Kingdom of God. Knorr said that only Jehovah God can provide a government powerful enough to correct the problems on earth. That heavenly government is the kingdom of God. On August 27, 1,361 men, women and youths were baptized in symbol of their dedication to God. One onlooker from Manhattan was moved to write: &quot;Regardless of what people may feel about the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, it must be admitted that they’ve proved one thing —that the Bible sure works when applied to the field of human relations. What with racial tensions being as they are, it’s a pleasure to see that some people can live together as just one race, the human race. We all can learn a lesson from that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">At War</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Appeals for India and Pakistan to halt the war between them have gone out from many nations. On September 7 U Thant, secretarygeneral of the United Nations, left by air for India and Pakistan in search for a peaceful solution. &quot;I have no illusions about this mission,” Thant said on his departure. &quot;The issues arc infinitely complicated and difficult and the situation out there is extremely grave.” Moscow too had urged India and Pakistan to stop fighting and had offered its offices in seeking a settlement of their dispute over Kashmir. In En</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">gland, some </span><span class="font17">87,000 Indian immigrants and 80,000 Pakistani immigrants have been living in peace and mutual regard. Yet so intense has the war become that thousands of these Indians and Pakistani in England reportedly are going home so that they can fight and kill one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">All-Digit Dialing</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The digit dialing system will be fully enforced in Britain in three to four years to make room for more exchanges, said the Postmaster General, Anthony Wedgwood Benn. In this twentieth century when highly technical machines are doing more and more of man’s work, too many Britons, said the postmaster, still regard the phone as a &quot;contraption” rather than a “precision instrument” that should be approached as a space pilot approaches his capsule or a racing driver his car. If such an approach were made, there would be greater efficiency, fewer mistakes and less waste,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Wann Arctic</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•$&gt; Once Canada’s Arctic was warm. In fact there is evidence of a shallow tropical inland sea, where the water once must have been at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit because several samples of coral fossils have been found that cannot exist at lower temperatures. Discoveries are being made about 1,500 miles north of Edmonton, which is only 1,200 miles from the North Pole. These findings give evidence that before the global flood of Noah's day the entire earth enjoyed a uniformly warm climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Twinkle, Little Star</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;&amp; Early in life children learn that stars actually do not twinkle, that the twinkling effect is caused by a layer of atmosphere above the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, not until recently has this theory been confirmed scientifically. Rocket tests have confirmed that the layer of atmosphere that causes about 80 percent of the twinkling is that of the tropopause, which is located at an altitude of about 35,000 to 40,000 feet, depending on the time of the year. The other 20 percent of the twinkling is caused above and below this layer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Pollution Kills Fish</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On July 3 the United States Public Health Service reported that about 18,400,000 fish were killed by water pollution in 1964. This was a tremendous increase over the estimated 7,900,000 fish that died in 1963. Part of the estimated increase was said to be due to improved reporting practices. Forty states reported a total of 486 instances of fish kills, the worst being a 7,800,000 kill because of industrial pollution near New Miami, Ohio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Jesus opened a new way of life to the people of his day. This made his work and teaching highly controversial—so much so, in fact, that most of them failed to respond, or actually opposed him. The Bible record reveals, though, that there were many who “heard him gladly.” These were the ones who really listened &quot;to what he had to say and who accepted it with honest hearts. They were able to identify the things he spoke as truths because they were from God, “things in which it is impossible for God to lie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today we must be just as discerning in reading the Bible. We must not be misled by the popularity of those religions that have become a part of this world. Be sure of Jesus’ words and teachings. Read</span></p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God has lovingly provided a “house of prayer” for all the peoples. It is no expression of interfaith, but is a provision that Jehovah has made for the benefit of persons out of all nations who want to worship him in spirit and in truth. The Watchtower magazine has aided tens of thousands to come to God’s house of prayer. Throughout April, Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, with three Bible study booklets, on a contribution of $1.
MAKE TIME COUNT
Time means more than money. Money spent can be replaced, but time once lost can never be regained. Use time wisely. Choose your reading with discernment. Make every minute count. You can if you read The Watchtower. It contains counsel and instruction from God’s Word the Bible. Time spent in this pursuit can lead to life. It takes just a few minutes a day. Try it for one year. Only $1. Send now and receive free three timely booklets.

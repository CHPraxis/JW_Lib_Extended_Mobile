<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God has lovingly provided a “house of prayer” for all the peoples. It is no expression of interfaith, but is a provision that Jehovah has made for the benefit of persons out of all nations who want to worship him in spirit and in truth. The <em>Watchtower </em>magazine has aided tens of thousands to come to God’s house of prayer. Throughout April, Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>with three Bible study booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

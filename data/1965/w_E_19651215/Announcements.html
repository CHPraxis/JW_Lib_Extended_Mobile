<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The year 1965 is closing and a new year is beginning. Will it bring the joys you anticipate, fulfill the hopes of which you dream? Begin each day with the heartwarming experience of instructive and inspiring Bible reading. Do this by considering the Daily Texts and Comments found in the back of the 1966 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>Send 50c. Another daily reminder and companion to the <em>Yearbook </em>is the 1966 calendar, which displays the year’s Bible text and additional Scriptural themes. It is only 25c. Send today.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One who obeys the commandments of Jesus Christ fears, not men, but God. He knows that, not men, but God is the one who will award everlasting life to his faithful servants. To enable others, in addition to themselves, to gain that blessing, they publicly proclaim the truths of the Bible, and that in spite of any opposition they encounter. During December, as Jehovah’s witnesses talk to people about the Bible, they will also be offering them the modern-English <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>along with the new book <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </em>on a contribution of $1.50.</p>

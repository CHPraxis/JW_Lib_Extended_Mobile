<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Drawing great consolation from the written Word of “the God of all comfort,” the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society of Pennsylvania announces herewith the death of Brother Hugo H. Riemer on March 31, 1965. After years of service as a pioneer publisher in the field, he was called to the Society’s Brooklyn headquarters in 1918, since which time he served with the Society’s headquarters till his death at eighty-six years of age. He was on the boards of directors of both the Society’s Pennsylvania corporation and its New York corporation, also serving in the official capacity of assistant secretary-treasurer of both corporations. Thus, after his dedication to Jehovah God in 1904, he served for the greater part of his long life in the direct, full-time service of his heavenly Father, as one of the anointed remnant of Christ’s followers. After a funeral service attended by 239 on Saturday morning, April 3, interment of his earthly remains took place at the private burial plot of the Brooklyn Bethel family at Huguenot Park, Staten Island, N.Y. We are happy at his entering into the heavenly happiness spoken of in the promise of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:13-66:14:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 14:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Have you ever wondered why Jesus taught us to pray to God, “Hallowed be thy name,” or, “Let your name be sanctified”? Is this just a statement of praise to God on our part? No, there is more to it. Read the 384-page book <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified.” </em>Send only 50c.</p>

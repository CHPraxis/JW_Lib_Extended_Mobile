“Word of Truth” District Assemblies
Have you made definite arrangements to attend? If not, now is the time to do so. From June through August assemblies focusing attention on God’s “Word of Truth” will be held under the direction of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Each will provide a four-day spiritual feast for those in attendance, and in New York the program will be expanded to six days.
The program will begin at 2 p.m. of the opening day at each assembly, and it will conclude on Sunday at about 6 p.m. Plan to be on hand for every session.
The assembly locations for the entire United States, Canada and Bermuda are listed below, along with the rooming headquarters for each city. Five weeks before the opening day of the assembly you plan to attend you may write to Watch Tower Convention at the rooming address given for the assembly city, and they will be glad to help you to obtain rooming accommodations.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>DURING THE LUNCH HOUR</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● One of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil worked on the construction of a bridge with some 250 other persons. During the lunch hour he would share Bible truths with another worker, and placed with this man the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </em>“The book was lent to one after another,” he reports. “This enabled me to place 14 books with my fellow workers during lunch hours, resulting in a home Bible study with one of them.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>HIS QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● A Witness in Michigan related this experience at a recent circuit assembly: “Some months ago a young man walked into our Kingdom Hall in Cassopolis and stayed for the meetings. Afterward, I welcomed him. A Bible study was started in the booklet <em>‘Look! I Am Making All Things New.’ </em>The events that led to this man’s coming to the Kingdom Hall are interesting.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“He works in a mobile home factory, and some time ago two Witnesses who are full-time ministers came to work part time at this same plant. The Witnesses were assigned to the same department with this young man. They set good examples in their work and witnessed to him whenever possible without doing an injustice to their employer. The young man scoffed, but an impression was made on his mind. Shortly thereafter he began taking an interest in some Seventh-day Adventist literature left at his door. His mother had died, and now he was interested more in the Bible. The more he studied the Seventh-day Adventist literature the more questions came into his mind. He looked around for someone who could answer them. He decided to approach the two Witnesses with whom he worked. For the next few months he would discuss matters with the Witnesses at break times. Sometimes the discussions would continue after work hours. Later, this man admitted: ‘Everything I had learned and offered as proof for the understanding I was gleaning from my personal studies, Jehovah’s witnesses were able to knock away with a few scriptures and replace it with such logical explanations that one would have to be a small baby not to be able to understand.’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Time passed and one of the Witnesses went to work elsewhere and the other moved to the Watch Tower Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. Before leaving for New York, however, this minister gave him one of the Watch Tower Society’s Bible-study books. He read this book through three times and then decided it was about time he should approach the Kingdom Hall and find the Witnesses to see what more he could learn. He now attends the meetings regularly and has said that he is convinced that he has found the truth.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● In 1959 one of Jehovah’s witnesses was hired by a man starting a new shop to electroplate automobile bumpers. He soon was able to get his brother (also a Witness) on the job. As the work expanded, more and more men were hired. The two Witnesses, by witnessing to their workmates at appropriate times, were able to help five men to learn and accept God’s truth. At present a man and his family are having a home Bible study and are attending meetings. When the Witnesses wish to attend a convention, the employer finds out when they will be off and closes the shop for vacation.</p>

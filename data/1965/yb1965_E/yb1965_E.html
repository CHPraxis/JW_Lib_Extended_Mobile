<p><span class="font5">The peoples of all nations are flooded with nationalistic propaganda through their own newspapers, magazines, radio and television. Hemmed in by boundaries and censorship, the peoples’ thinking is confined to their own nation, to worshiping it, to idolizing it. This controlled thinking affects almost everyone’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font5"> says: “Nationalism is a state of mind which can be, and often is, induced by governmental and private propaganda. It can be the creature of ambitious leaders who wish to form certain patterns of opinion which they expect to use, for their own purposes perhaps, or for ends they consider to be in the public interest.”<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark152">1</a></sup> Under the heading “Irrationality” it states: “The ability of governmental and civic leaders to spread the ferment of nationalism among the masses is greatly facilitated by its highly irrational character. The extreme patriot is largely impervious to rational argument. Even in free countries, he may never hear the truth, especially if he reads only tendentious newspapers or tunes in his radio to biased, chauvinistic [blind, enthusiastic] commentators. Moreover, it is difficult to see how adults can consider the international problems facing their nation with any de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">gree of objectivity if as young children their minds were formed by history books that were one-sided and biased.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Analyzing these comments by worldly observers, ask yourself the question: Does nationalism take first place in my life and all my time and thinking or does my worship to God come first? Remember, the Bible is a book to be studied too. In it you learn about God and what your worship of him should be, and it sets out the history of man from man’s very creation. It even describes the conditions that exist in the earth today, and tells us about new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to His promise, and in which righteousness is to dwell. (2 Pet. 3:13) If the Bible does that, then why not think, too, on what its author, Jehovah, says about man and what our relation to him should be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Think carefully now! Does the nation in which you live give you all the things you possess? Did your government give you the sun, stars and moon above? Did your nation create the snowcapped mountains, the wooded slopes, the fertile valleys, the rushing streams? Did it bring forth the green grass, the fresh air, the babbling brooks? When you stand on a hilltop and look over the landscape, are the things you see, the blossoms of fruit trees, the waving grain, things that the government gave you? Is it your national government that created the vegetation and the cattle on a thousand hills? The rulers in government may have had something to do with the management of the productive land, but who created the heavens and the earth? Who made it possible for there to be people? Did not God make man with reproductive powers? Surely the State has no control of these!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Read what God said in his book the Bible through the apostle Paul to the Athenians: “The</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">* The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font2"> Volume 19, page 756, 1956 edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God that made the world and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples, neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed seasons and the set limits of the dwelling of men, for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.”—Acts 17:24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God gave us “life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men.” Nationalism did not do that, nor did Caesar. The Jewish Pharisees, proud religionists of Jesus’ day, tried to catch Jesus in his speech by having him say something against Roman nationalism. Jesus Christ had the reputation of speaking the truth freely, but it was always God’s Word he spoke. So the Pharisees said: “ ‘You teach the way of God in line with truth: Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not? Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?’ Detecting their hypocrisy, he said to them: ‘Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius to look at.’ They brought one. And he said to them: ‘Whose image and inscription is this?’ They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’ Jesus then said: ‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.’ ’’—Mark 12:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was not against orderly government, nor the paying of taxes. But rulers must recognize, too, that there are certain things that belong to God. Not everything is Caesar’s! Remember, it was Jehovah who created man to dwell upon the earth. Jehovah the Almighty God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.” And God went on to say to newly created man and woman: “Here I have given to you all vegetation bearing seed which is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. To you let it serve as food.”—Gen. 1:26, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was Jehovah God who provided all these things for humankind. They were all here in plenty before any nations were formed, before nationalism was heard of. So again we ask, Does your worship to God come first? It should!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nineteen hundred years ago the nationalistic Jews were under Roman rule and definitely rejected their God, Jehovah, as well as his Son, Jesus Christ. This is what happened after the Jews turned Jesus, their prisoner, over to Pilate. Pilate brought Jesus outside before the crowd and said to the Jews: “See! Your king!” “However, they shouted: ‘Take him away! Take him away! Impale him!’ Pilate said to them: ‘Shall I impale your king?’ The chief priests answered: ‘We have no king but Caesar.’” (John 19:13-15) These Jews showed their extremely nationalistic spirit. They had rejected and forgotten their God and despised his truth-speaking Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This action, however, did not make Jehovah lessen his love for mankind. “For God loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) No ruler of any nation, not even Caesar, has been able to give anyone everlasting life. The message of Jesus during his three and a half years of ministry was one of life for all mankind through God’s kingdom, but the nationalistic ones among the Jews were not listening. They wanted nothing to do with God’s kingdom. Those individuals who listened and believed took up Jesus’ message and preached the good news of God’s kingdom under very adverse circumstances. Finally, governments opposed them. Jesus had warned them well in advance as to what would happen if they became followers of him. He had told them: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name. It will turn out to you for a witness.”—Luke 21:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither the Jews nor the Romans appreciated the message of good news that was being delivered by Christians. However, the apostle Paul, though a Jew by birth, put Christianity and his worship to God ahead of nationalism. He put his life in Jehovah God’s hands. So he could say: “Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in cases of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.” (2 Cor. 12:10) Paul had a work to do and he did it! He knew that his eternal life was not dependent upon his service to any nation or its ruler. His everlasting life would come from Jehovah God through His arrangements. Paul believed Jesus when this one said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.”—John 14:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNAFRAID OF DEATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over the centuries many Christians have been killed for not bowing to the State. Paul was, it is believed, beheaded in Rome. Christians have not been afraid to die, because they know God is the Giver of life and they are well acquainted with Jesus’ words: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”—Matt. 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Government is a necessary and good thing when it serves the people, but when it is oppressive, the people suffer. Good government is needed, especially today when there are over 3,200,000,000 peo-pie in the world. But must the government be worshiped by the people? Must it be superior to all other loyalties of the people? If man’s laws conflict with God’s laws, then what? The apostles had to answer that question to the Sanhedrin. “Peter and the other apostles said: ‘We must obey God as ruler rather than men.’ ” Because of their devotion to Jehovah God the rulers “flogged them, and ordered them to stop speaking.” After that what did these do? “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:29, 40-42) So even though government is necessary, it cannot stop, and has no right to stop, persons from telling the truth, which is good news for all peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But how does nationalism begin? Certain groups of people, usually of the same family head, live closely together and have a deep sense of belonging to one another. They form the same habits and have the same way of life. Their loyalty is to the group and they want everyone in the group to contribute to the welfare of one another. There is certainly nothing wrong in people loving one another and wanting to enjoy one another’s association and being interested in the well-being of one another. This is a God-given commandment, loving your neighbor as yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, as these groups get larger, often certain individuals talk up national patriotism. Now their national group is told it is superior to all other groups, and the leader tries to show their group’s superiority over other groups by aggression and conquest. Ignoring the thinking ability of some who want to live as the Bible directs, the dictator of a group will try to force all the people to rally around him, to do obeisance to a manmade ensign, flag, image or a symbol of the group’s way of life. When that happens their nationalistic spirit is being pushed too far. Godfearing men know that Jehovah “made out of one man every nation of men” and so will not go along in the worship of the State through its emblems. Then the minority suffers for not going along with the majority. Jesus and the apostles were in the minority but were right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the other factors that bring about nationalism are language, race, religion, territory and political way of life, besides economic factors. When we examine true world history we can see that many national groups have been formed from very small groups. In fact, all the human family since the great deluge have come from Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth. The Bible plainly says that “these three were Noah’s sons, and from these was all the earth’s population spread abroad.” (Gen. 9:19) First there were family groups, then tribes, later the living together in cities. Thus came Nimrod’s kingdom. (Gen. 10:9, 10) Over the centuries great nations have expanded across territories in conquest of other nations. We have thus had world empires, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome. Since then, in recent years, we have seen many nations push forward into prominence. You remember Mussolini of Italy, who wanted to be a conqueror of parts of Africa. He allied himself with Hitler of Germany, who tried to take over all of Europe, Asia and Africa. He really wanted to be the ruler of the world. What a butcher he turned out to be! Following the failure of his schemes to conquer the nations, there have been many national groups seeking independence, and they have shown intense patriotism and loyalty to certain leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Strife” has been the newspaper’s headline, especially since 1914, to this very day. Aggressive nationalists are demanding certain rights and territory for certain groups of people. So new governments are formed. In the past four years in Africa alone some twenty-four new countries have been set up. And since World War II this continent has produced some thirty-six new states.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark153">2</a></sup> </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font5"> makes this statement: “Since World War II, nationalism has continued to play a major role throughout the world. The Hitlerian techniques were developed still further by Joseph Stalin, who proved himself an apt pupil of fascist nationalism. ”t However, in discussing nationalism the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Americana</span><span class="font5"> says: “In early times, man’s supreme loyalty was centered on his religion. Today this place has been taken by the nation.”.!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font5"> magazine of December 7, 1962, page 20, said: “The feudal lords of the Middle Ages gave their allegiance to king, not country, and French barons fighting on the side of invading English kings were considered faithful vassals, not collaborators. Writes historian Carlton Hayes: ‘Nationality has always existed. Patriotism has long existed, either as applied to a locality or as extended to an empire. But the fusion of patriotism with nationality and the predominance of national patriotism over all other human loyalties—which is nationalism—is modern, very modern.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Nationalists came to learn that their creed contained bad seeds as well as good. The nation demanded supreme loyalty from its citizens, insisted on its superiority over other nationalities, fostered pride in the national character and destiny. Carried too far, these convictions played a part in World War I and, in a perversion of nationalism, loosed the Nazi terror on the world, piling the earth with corpses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nationalism: A Religion,</span><span class="font5"> Roman Catholic author Carlton Hayes also makes this statement, on page ten: “There are degrees of nationalism as of any emotion. Our loyalty to nationality and national state may be conditioned by other loyalties—to family, to church, to humanity, to internationalism—and hence restricted in corresponding degree. On the other hand, nationalism may be a paramount, a supreme loyalty, commanding all others. This usually occurs when national emotion is fused with religious emotion, and nationalism itself becomes a religion or a substitute for religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIANITY AND NATIONALISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless, let this be known: Christianity and nationalism do not mix. Christ Jesus never mixed them. But what about the Catholic and Protestant religions of Christendom? They go all out for nationalism and support each country in which they have adherents. The clergy of all these religions even campaign for political leaders and some run for political office themselves. In time of war the clergy take the lead in encouraging the young men of their nation to engage in murder against their own denominational members in another country, even though the Bible, which they claim as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a basis for</span><span class="font5"> their religious belief, says you should not kill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What have the clergy of these religious organizations become? What have they made of their parishioners? James, a footstep follower of Jesus Christ, said this: “Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) You must know where their loyalties are. Can they not understand that either one is faithful to one master, while hating the other, or vice versa? Jesus forcefully said: “No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” (Matt. 6:24) Are you a Christian? If so, what comes first in your life? You have a right to choose for yourself. But do you have a right to condemn and punish another Christian who chooses his Creator as his Master rather than the State?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Christian dedicated to the doing of Jehovah’s will is going to do what Jehovah teaches him to do. Jehovah has revealed himself and his will through his written Word, the Holy Bible. The more one becomes acquainted with the written Word the better one understands what to do. Jesus took his stand—so did the apostles and the early Christians—not against Rome, but for Jehovah, their chosen Master. He was their God. Other persons, the majority, chose Caesar. That was their privilege, but why persecute the minority, the believers and worshipers of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There comes a time in everyone’s life when he has to decide where to keep his loyalties. To be loyal to Jehovah does not mean one is unfriendly to his neighbor, not even to the nation in which he was born. Jesus taught that we should love both our Father in heaven and our neighbor. (Luke 10: 27) But that does not mean that we have to do what our neighbor does. Jesus advised in his Sermon on the Mountain: “You heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you; that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.” (Matt. 5:43-45) So you can love your neighbor, even your enemy, but that does not mean you have to do the wicked things he does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HISTORIC EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a moment let us move farther back into history to 617 B.C.E. In that year Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, took many Israelites captive to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar chose certain ones of the children of Israel, of the royal seed, to get special training in his court. The best ones were selected, the ones with good appearance, those having insight into all wisdom, and being acquainted with knowledge and good discernment. These were to stand in the palace of the king. Instructions were given to teach these young folks the writing and the tongue of the Chaldeans. In order that they might receive good food, “the king appointed a daily allowance from the delicacies of the king and from his drinking wine, even to nourish them for three years, that at the end of these they might stand before the king.”—Dan. 1:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the specially selected children there were four boys, probably ranging in age from fourteen to eighteen years. They were of the tribe of Judah. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah, Mish-ael and Azariah. Each of their names had an interesting meaning: Daniel meaning “God Is Judge”; Hananiah, “Jah Has Favored”; Mishael, “Who Is What God Is?”; Azariah, “Jah Is Keeper.” Changing their names very evidently had something to do with the desire of Nebuchadnezzar to draw them away from their God and to get them to think the Chaldean way rather than the Hebrew way. Daniel’s name was changed to Belteshazzar, which means “Prince of Bel,” or “The Lord’s Leader.” Hananiah’s name was changed to Shadrach, the meaning of which is obscure, but some say it means “The Servant of Aku” (the moon god). Mishael was called Meshach. The meaning of Meshach is not known, but some tradition has it that it is possibly the name of a Babylonian deity. Azariah’s name was changed to Abednego, meaning “Servant of Nego [or Mercury].” Thus they were to be servants of gods other than Jehovah. Did the changing of their names change them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These young men were not flattered at the change of their names or by the special attention they were getting from the king. They were devoted to the Almighty God Jehovah. Even though they were in captivity in Babylon, they wanted to live by God’s law as written in his Word. “Daniel determined in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the delicacies of the king and with his drinking wine.” (Dan. 1:8) He, along with his three companions, kept requesting just vegetables to eat and water to drink. Daniel had quite an argument with the court official providing the food, but he finally convinced him to bring that kind of simple food for ten days. Daniel and these young lads with him were likely recalling to mind the words of Deuteronomy 6:4-7: “Listen, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah. And you must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force. And these words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They knew the Ten Commandments and Jehovah’s ordinances concerning eating. They had inculcated in their minds Moses’ words: “And now, O Israel, listen to the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live.” (Deut. 4:1) They had an abhorrence of unclean and forbidden food. Refusing to eat meat and drink wine very likely offered to idols, they ate vegetables and “at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the children who were eating the delicacies of the king.” (Dan. 1:15) This, of course, pleased the court official who was looking after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. It pleased Jehovah, too, because, “as for these children, the four of them, to them the true God gave knowledge and insight in all writing and wisdom; and Daniel himself had understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams.”—Dan. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During their three-year training course they learned the Chaldean language and the other things taught, but they never forgot their God and the things they had learned in Judea concerning Jehovah’s laws. Even when being brought in to stand before the king, they were not overawed. Daniel, by God’s help, interpreted dreams, received many gifts from the king and was made ruler over the jurisdictional district of Babylon and was made the chief prefect over the wise men of Babylon; but even this did not turn his head. His loyalty to Jehovah still held first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Daniel, being now in such </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> high position, “made a request of the king, and he appointed over the administration of the jurisdictional district of Babylon Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, but Daniel was in the court of the king.” (Dan. 2:49) These four Jewish men stayed close to one another and together in their worship. Still they took care of their assigned duties, for they were slaves in Babylon. However, these four lads with great knowledge and responsibility were not going to become nationalists and be worshipers of the State and forget their love for God. They refused to render more to the State than was the State’s and nothing to God. Certainly they were not going to render anything to the State that was God’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All servants of Jehovah God will face tests sometime or another. Jesus said to the Christian witnesses of Jehovah that they too would face opposition and persecution for Christ’s sake. So it was with these four Hebrew children; someday they had to face the issue as to their loyalty and devotion. Would their loyalty prove to be to their God or to the State? Would they worship the nation and renounce their God? Would they bow to the State if it became a life-or-death matter? The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bible account in Daniel, chapter three, gives us the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FACING THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">King Nebuchadnezzar had a great image of gold made. Its height was sixty cubits (ninety feet) and its breadth was six cubits (nine feet). It was built on the plains of Dura in the jurisdictional district of Babylon, a place approximately six miles south of Babylon. “Nebuchadnezzar himself as king sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the police magistrates and all the administrators of the jurisdictional districts to come to the inauguration of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.” (Dan. 3:1, 2) This command of course would include Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who were appointed as administrators over the jurisdictional district of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was a deliberate attempt on the part of Satan the Devil, Babylon’s real god, to get these three Hebrews to bow down to the State, the State’s image, be it a monument, standard or flag. The golden image was representative of the empire of Babylon. All the appointed rulers of the countries that Nebuchadnezzar had conquered were to be there at the same time and bow down to this image. The nationalism of Babylon was being forced upon the Judeans, Assyrians, Egyptians and all whom Nebuchadnezzar had conquered. They came together. “And the herald was crying out loudly: ‘To you it is being said, O peoples, national groups and languages, that at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, you fall down and worship the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. And whoever does not fall down and worship will at the same moment be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.’” (Dan. 3:4-6) The command was, Bow to the image, worship the State! Nationalism! All the peoples, the rulers large and small, must now worship what Jesus called Caesar, or his image, Nationalism!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But look! There are three men standing! They are not bowing down! Can you imagine it! These three men had gone along with all the others to the plain of Dura at the command of the king, but they were not bowing down. Why? They went as far as they could. They assembled with the others, but now the test came. They made the right decision. The three Judeans, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, called to mind the words of Jehovah spoken to Moses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. You must not have any other gods against my face. You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation, in the case of those who hate me; but exercising loving-kindness toward the thousandth generation in the case of those who love me and keep my commandments. You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.”—Ex. 20:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That was understandable to these three Hebrews. They gave their God exclusive devotion. They would not bow down and worship a manmade image or standard. They loved their life and believed that their God would save them. But if they were not kept alive, then there was no reason to fear death, because they believed in a resurrection of the dead. When Nebuchadnezzar heard what happened, he went into a rage and fury and ordered an investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These three Hebrews were brought before Nebuchadnezzar, and he said to them: “Is it really so, O Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you are not serving my own gods, and the image of gold that I have set up you are not worshiping?” (Dan. 3:14) It was disturbing to the king to have these fine servants of his step out of line and not do this little thing, ‘just bow down, that is all.’ So Nebuchadnezzar said he would give them another opportunity. His words were: “Now if you are ready so that when you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, and the bagpipe and all sorts of musical instruments, you fall down and worship the image that I have made, all right. But if you do not worship, at that same moment you will be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is that god that can rescue you out of my hands?” —Dan. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It did not take these three Hebrews even a moment to decide. Their minds had been made up. From the time they were young men, from the time that they were being fed in the king’s private school for nobles, they knew whom they would serve. If they would not break Jehovah’s laws on eating food, would they now break his law on image worship? So without hesitation “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered, and they were saying to the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we are under no necessity in this regard to say back a word to you. If it is to be, our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand, O king, he will rescue us. But if not, let it become known to you, O king, that your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.’ ”—Dan. 3:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Faith! Loyalty! Where have we since heard such a powerful decision? Remember when Satan tried to get Jesus to “do an act of worship” to him? Jesus was not slow in his answer either. “Then Jesus said to him: ‘Go away, Satan! For it is written, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” ’ ”—Matt. 4:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIVERANCE TO THE FAITHFUL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nebuchadnezzar knew full well whom these three Hebrews worshiped. But would they break under pressure when bound and ready to be thrown into the furnace? Would they then bow to the State and become nationalistic? Would they try to serve two masters? Would they render to the State things that did not belong to the State?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These three men ‘did not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.’ Rather, they were like true Christians today who really appreciate the fine example of the three Hebrews who were “in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (Matt. 10:28) They watched Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury and with his very expression changed toward them. The king commanded, ‘Throw them into the fiery furnace, now made seven times as hot.’ They were thrown into the furnace heated so hot that when the men who were commanded to throw the three Hebrews into the furnace did so they themselves were killed by the intense flames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Nebuchadnezzar saw a frightening thing. He rose up in a hurry and said: “Was it not three able-bodied men that we threw bound into the midst of the fire?” Those with him said: “Yes, O king.” But Nebuchadnezzar in his excitement said: “Look! I am beholding four able-bodied men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt to them, and the appearance of the fourth one is resembling a son of the gods.” Then Nebuchadnezzar called out to the three men in the fire and told them to step out and come to him. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego stepped out from the midst of the fire. It was truly amazing. The fire had had no power over their bodies, not even a hair on their heads had been singed. Even their mantles had not been affected and the smell of fire itself had not come upon them! These men had gone through some experience and proved their faithfulness.—Dan. 3:24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experience shook Nebuchadnezzar, for he said: “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants that trusted in him and that changed the very word of the king and gave over their bodies, because they would not serve and would not worship any god at all except their own God. And from me an order is being put through, that any people, national group or language that says anything wrong against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego should be dismembered, and its house should be turned into a public privy; forasmuch as there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.” (Dan. 3:28, 29) Do you today likewise believe that there “does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR FINAL DECISION BEING FORCED TODAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nationalism today shows its authority too and can be very cruel to Christian worshipers of the true God Jehovah. The historian Arnold J. Toynbee, on page sixty-nine of his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity Among the Religions of the World,</span><span class="font5"> said: “The collective power of Athens was worshipped by the Athenians in the form of the goddess Athena. . . . In the renaissance of Hellenism in the modem Western World in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, this Greek idolatrous attitude towards one’s own country, one’s own fatherland, was imported from the Ancient Greek past back into our modern Western life. Only, unlike the Greeks, we have flinched from openly admitting that we are practicing this form of idolatry; and consequently we are even more at the mercy of this idolatrous type of Nationalism than the Greeks were at the mercy of their more frankly avowed idolatrous worship of their local states.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some persons may say, ‘Well, that is not so bad.’ But are not these persons rather shortsighted? Just go back thirty years to the days of Hitler’s Germany. Remember how he demanded that everyone worship the State? Anyone who would not heil Hitler with his arm raised to the swastika was sent off to a concentration camp, there to die. He had his own fiery furnaces, his gas chambers, his starvation program. In the book entitled “My Story,” written by Gemma La Guardia Gluck, she says this, in chapter eight: “Now I shall describe briefly the Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] in the camp. They belonged to a religious sect that believes in the words of the Bible as literal truth. I did not know of the existence of this sect before I came to Ravensbruck. . . . Most of the Bible Students in Ravensbruck were simple, honest wives and mothers, a very hardworking lot. In this camp they were generally employed as servants, doing the heaviest labor. They told me they had been among the first prisoners at Ravensbruck and have been used for all kinds of construction jobs when the Nazis began to build the camp. I admired these women for their strength of character. They had a stanch will and faith. They had been in prison for eight, ten, or twelve years, right from the beginning of Hitler’s regime in 1933, when members of their sect refused to answer or acknowledge the official Nazi greeting, ‘Heil Hitler.’ Bible Students insisted on the right to remain neutral in political matters and not to be forced to salute a power that had been created by man, not God. ‘Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are His’ was their credo. The authoritarian Nazi regime could not stand for such disobedience, and thousands of Bible Students were arrested and sent to the camps. At one point the Gestapo had announced that any Bible Student who renounced his beliefs and signed a statement to that effect would be given his freedom and be persecuted no longer. It is difficult to believe, but it is true, that not one of them signed such a statement. They preferred to go on suffering and patiently waiting for the day of liberation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gemma La Guardia Gluck, the elder sister of the late Fiorello La Guardia, former mayor of New York City, wrote her story in 1961, telling what she and others lived through in the concentration camps of Hitler. She thus adds to the testimony that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah in Germany, some of whom are still living today, were offered a second chance to change their minds and bow down, just as the three Hebrew friends of Daniel were. All they had to do was sign a statement and heil Hitler and they would be free from further persecution. Like the three Hebrew men, they refused “to bow.” They obeyed God as ruler rather than men. They were not fearful of those who could kill the body but cannot kill the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEARLESSNESS TOWARD MEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, the days of Hitler are gone. But how about the nationalistic spirit engendered worldwide? East Germany, now under communistic influence, has its strong nationalistic spirit opposed to the right worship of Jehovah God. Recently a young schoolgirl, a witness of Jehovah, had done very well in her examinations at school in East Germany. She was assigned to write on the subject “Why Is the Worker’s Class the Only One Entitled to Lead the Nation?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believing that God’s kingdom, for which she prayed, was the one to rule all nations, she could not think of any reasons to support a nationalistic answer. So she wrote an article showing that God’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind and that Christ Jesus is its righteous Ruler, and that the laboring class through its dictators was not meant to take Jehovah God’s place in government. After her paper was read, she was immediately called before three persons who strongly disagreed with her article and ridiculed her faith in God and told her that she would have to expect a very low grade unless she did the paper over. She explained that this was what she believed and she was not going to compromise. They asked the question. She gave her honest answer from God’s Word. Before school ended, the board finally mentioned that she distinguished herself in honesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It takes courage for a young Christian to stand for Bible principle. The three Hebrews also took that stand. They trained their minds from childhood by studying the truth. Setting the right example in true worship must be done before all mankind, since every nation and tribe and tongue must “fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.” (Rev. 14: 7) This is the day for decision. What will you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Behind the Iron Curtain the disseminating of Bible truths in printed form or by word of mouth by Jehovah’s witnesses is forbidden. Over the years thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned for talking about the Bible. Recently three of Jehovah’s witnesses who had received life terms in prison for preaching the good news of God’s kingdom were released by the Communists from prison after fifteen years of confinement. One of the three is seventy-four years old. He had been imprisoned for nine years under the Hitler regime and for fifteen years under Communist rule. Think of it! This man spent twenty-four years of his life, nearly a third of his lifetime, in prison because he dared to preach the Bible. He refused to heil Hitler and his Nazism or nationalism. He refused to deny his God for the Communists. Truly there are still those who say, “Your gods are not the ones we are serving”!—Dan. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On June 10, 1964, there were two young girls, Jehovah’s witnesses, who had traveled from their village to the capital city of Madrid, Spain, to do some shopping. As opportunity afforded they talked about the good news of God’s kingdom to persons that they would meet. Did not Jesus say: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations”? (Matt. 28:19) After having talked to quite a few people and having bought the things they needed, they started home on the bus. Police agents got on the bus and ordered them off and told them to go with them to the police headquarters. These two young girls were interrogated from eight o’clock in the evening of June 10 until eleven o’clock on the morning of June 11; fifteen hours. Is this Catholic state afraid some persons in Spain will find out what the Catholic Bible used by these girls says about God’s kingdom? The father of the girls is an overseer in a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in a small town outside of Madrid. So they were taught the truth and were not afraid to tell it out. What satisfaction the father must have had to see his girls fearlessly standing on God’s side even though arrested and fined; and for what reason? “Because of belonging to the sect of Jehovah’s witnesses and making trips to the capital to carry on proselyting activities for the Jehovah’s witnesses sect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dictatorial, nationalistic country of Spain says, ‘You may not worship your God, you may not express your views about God’s Word in this country!’ But arrests and fines and a jail record will not stop genuine Christians. Their worship of Jehovah comes first. In 1950, in Spain, there were only 93 persons talking to those that had ears to hear, and today, in 1965, there are 3,502 witnesses of Jehovah still preaching, including these two young girls. Persecution has not dampened the zeal of Jehovah’s servants in Spain, has it? And persecution has not dampened it in other countries either. What are you doing to bring the message of salvation to those of mankind in your community?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These experiences are not isolated cases. Much information has been published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines about the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain and Portugal, both strongly Catholic dictatorial countries. But to give you another incident, on April 2, 1964, police agents forced their way into a home in Spain. There they took Bibles and Bible literature and the keys of the house and arrested a twenty-sevenyear-old minister of Jehovah’s witnesses. He had been arrested previously, in June 1963, and on that occasion spent thirty days in jail for “proselytism,” preaching from the Bible. While the police were making their search another young minister called at the house. He was seventeen years old, and he also was arrested. Both were thrown into prison, held twenty days and then released. Such harassment has not stopped the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom in Spain. Young men and women and the older folks who are witnesses of Jehovah in Spain will continue preaching. While the Catholic clergy tell the people to give all to Caesar, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to give Caesar only what is his, but God’s things to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Cuba nationalism is sung from the housetops through television, radio and the press. Loyalty to the nation comes first, say its rulers. So to be a Christian there takes courage. Two of Jehovah’s witnesses were going from house to house preaching God’s kingdom as taught in the Bible. For doing this they were sentenced to four months in jail. Two circuit servants, traveling ministers, spent a month in jail for preaching God’s kingdom. In another part of Cuba six congregation servants were taken to jail, some for three months, some for four months. So it goes if one freely speaks the truth about God and what he has done and will do. Jehovah’s witnesses were all told to stop what they were doing and get in line with the State’s teaching on communism. But how can a Christian do that when God’s Word says: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come”? (Matt. 24:14) Whom would you obey?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Africa much violence has been brought to bear against Jehovah’s witnesses because political parties are trying to force them to sign up with their nationalistic groups. If a witness of Jehovah refuses to buy a political card from a certain political group, then his house is stoned or broken up and often the occupants are brutally beaten. It takes real faith to stand for Jehovah God and his kingdom against such political violence. An overseer and several Kingdom publishers in Africa were so badly beaten that they had to go to the hospital. Their crops were burned too. In another place Jehovah’s witnesses had their houses, Kingdom Halls and grain storage places all burned to the ground. They were driven from the community and some who were caught were severely beaten by the political party. The cause for such persecution is that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to engage in politics and worship the State. On the other hand, the false religious organizations, all of which belong to the world empire of false religion, Babylon the Great, do not hesitate for a minute to ride along with the nationalistic trend and “fall down and worship the image of gold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rulers today do not like this information to be publicized, but really the world of mankind is no better off than it was in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of ancient Babylon. They have the same spirit and say: ‘If you do not bow down and worship the nationalistic image I have made and do as directed you will be thrown into the burning, fiery furnaces by the mob.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These hardships true Christians endure. These few examples show what is going on in all parts of the world today, and they should be a warning to us. The Christian witness of Jehovah cannot compromise. In Communist countries they must preach underground. This means that for Jehovah’s witnesses to meet as a congregation of God they have to do it secretly. Most people say, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses are foolish to go to such extremes. They just bring trouble on themselves.’ But it is not that they want to be persecuted. It is a clear matter of whom do you worship—the State, “Caesar,” or God, Jehovah? You will have to make the decision someday if you want everlasting life under God’s kingdom. Better it is to do it now than to put it off. “Before there comes upon you the day of Jehovah’s anger, seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth.” (Zeph. 2:2, 3) May your decision be to serve Him now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WORSHIP THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is necessary to learn what the Christian knows, that men can kill only the body, but they cannot kill the soul. (Matt. 10:28) In Jehovah God’s written Word he has promised a resurrection of the dead, and today the same Holy Scriptures that the Hebrews in Nebuchadnezzar’s day believed we still have and they are still true. The three Hebrew friends of Daniel knew what their ancestors taught them. For example, Hannah the mother of the prophet Samuel said: “There is no one holy like Jehovah, for there is no one but you; and there is no rock like our God. Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.”—1 Sam. 2:1, 2, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Believers in God’s Word know that God can bring up from Sheol, the common grave of dead mankind. That is something man cannot do. There will be a resurrection of the dead, the three Hebrews believed. So to die as martyrs in the fiery furnace meant to them to die and be kept in secret, asleep, for a time indefinite to them, but after that a resurrection. They knew of Job’s hard experience and likely recalled his words: “O that in Sheol [the grave] you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” (Job 14:13) Job was not afraid to go into the grave or Sheol, because he knew there would be a resurrection from it in God’s promised due time. Jehovah said to Abraham that through him and his seed all nations of the earth would be blessed. How could that be without the resurrection of the peoples of all nations? Abraham, Job and the three Hebrews knew, as do honest students of the Bible today, that the grave is where mankind in general goes and that those there are in an unconscious state. David, in support of this, wrote: “In death there is no mention of you; in Sheol who will laud you?” (Ps. 6:5) The psalmist said: “Hear this, all you peoples. Give ear, . . . Sheol rather than a lofty abode is for each one.” “From the hand of Sheol I shall redeem them; from death I shall recover them.” (Ps. 49: 1, 14; Hos. 13:14) A thousand years later the apostle Peter knew that David was still in the grave resting as in sleep, awaiting the resurrection. Read Acts 2:29, 34, 35 and Hebrews 11:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David was sure his God Jehovah would redeem him from the grave. Jehovah made provision for this through his Son Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all. (1 Tim. 2:5, 6) In due time David along with billions of others, including the three Hebrews and Daniel, will stand up and live in the new system of things after the battle of Armageddon. The last words of Daniel’s prophetic book are: “And as for you yourself, go toward the end; and you will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.” (Dan. 12:13) Daniel and the three Hebrews knew that, while one is living, this is good advice: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.” (Eccl. 9:10) They knew the condition of the dead, just as Christians today do. They read Isaiah’s prophecy, and it gave them hope when the three Hebrews were cast into the fiery furnace and when their friend Daniel was thrown to the lions. They read Jehovah’s words: “For here I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.” (Isa. 65:17) This would be the day for which Christians pray in saying, “Your kingdom come,” when the earth will be brought to a Paradise condition and there will be the resurrection of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now Christians are definitely assured of the resurrection because of Jesus’ own words. He said: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28, 29) When these three faithful Hebrews are resurrected in the new system of things, with new heavens and new earth, they will undoubtedly do good things during the reign of Christ Jesus. Then, because of their continued faith and loyalty to Jehovah their God, they will get the fulfillment of God’s promise.—Heb. 11:34, 39, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just how far-reaching is this resurrection Jesus spoke of when he said: “All those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out”? It certainly must be far-reaching, because the apostle Paul stated: “I have hope toward God, which hope these men themselves also entertain, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24: 15) However, does that mean that even those practicing vile things after their resurrection are going to keep on living in this new system of things? It appears from the Scriptures that those who do not want to change and do good things after being resurrected on earth will be cut off before too many years pass. Certainly they will be given the opportunity to know the truth through others’ teaching them God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Isaiah, who wrote about Jehovah’s creating new heavens and a new earth, also said about the shortness of life of sinners in comparison with everlasting life: “One will die as a mere boy, although a hundred years of age; and as for the sinner, although a hundred years of age he will have evil called down upon him.” (Isa. 65:20) It will be just as the apostle John stated: “Death and Hades gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.” (Rev. 20: 13) So if their deeds in the “new earth” show they exhibit no faith and love of righteousness and they strive to practice vile things, then their portion will be in the lake that bums with fire and sulphur. This means the second death.—Rev. 20:14, 15; John 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus it seems that those who do not develop an appreciation of life under the new system of things when Christ is king will not be permitted to live indefinitely. Those returning from the grave, young or old, to begin with, will have to make progress in the right direction after they are told what happened and what the conditions of living are then under God’s kingdom. After having an opportunity of understanding Jehovah’s Word, and being given information on the effects of sin upon mankind over a six-thousand-year period, and how the ransom of Christ Jesus makes it possible for them to gain everlasting life, if after all this they refuse Jehovah’s provision for life, then they will be condemned to everlasting destruction. Thus their resurrection will prove to be “a resurrection of judgment” because of their doing vile things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who, during their present life, have acquainted themselves with God’s Word and who are withdrawing from the evil practices of this wicked system of things will certainly make far smoother progress when they are resurrected from the dead, because they will want to continue doing good things. They will be striving to make theirs a “resurrection of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A tremendous educational program will be in operation during the thousand-year reign of Christ. All coming forth from Sheol or Hades will have an opportunity to learn, but there will be those who prove incorrigible, who will not adopt right worship. That will be their responsibility. But still they will first have an opportunity to decide on choosing either life or adverse judgment. Only those will get life who are doing the will of God. Remember, Isaiah said: “As for the sinner, although a hundred years of age he will have evil called down upon him.” Some may feel that a hundred years is a rather long time to prove a man right or wrong. But Jehovah is patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We read in the Scriptures: “Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad. Although a sinner may be doing bad a hundred times and continuing a long time as he pleases, yet I am also aware that it will turn out well with those fearing the true God, because they were in fear of him. But it will not turn out well at all with the wicked one, neither will he prolong his days that are like a shadow, because he is not in fear of God.” —Eecl. 8:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So during the rule of the kingdom of God very likely this principle will be applied. If one wishes to prolong his days he will have to do good things. Those who do bad things even a hundred times early in life or when nearing one hundred years of age will certainly be proving themselves habitual sinners. Then, when God chooses, his judgment will be called down upon such ones. So they will die as mere boys, although some of them are a hundred years of age. Just how long people will be given the opportunity to practice vile things we cannot say, but it will be long enough to determine that the individuals do not want to do the will of God. There will be many who will not prove rebellious and vile until the end of the thousand years, when Satan the Devil is loosed a little while to test all then alive on earth. (Rev. 20:7-10) Those who do good things will live to the end of the thousand years. If then they pass the final test of perfect obedience to God, they will prove to be “those who did good things” and their resurrection will turn out to be a “resurrection of life.”—John 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why, therefore, get steeped in wickedness now, continuing with this wicked system of things that will be destroyed at the battle of Armageddon? Why not get acquainted with God’s Word and study it daily, taking advantage of sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word? Paul says: “Working together with him, we also entreat you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose. For he says: Tn an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.’ Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.” —2 Cor. 6: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many persons today find it quite easy and pleasant to go along with the false religious organizations that encourage them to compromise with the State and even to worship the State. But God’s written Word says: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues. For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind.”—Rev. 18:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely now is the time to flee from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. If you do not want to go down in the destruction that God is bringing upon false religion, then flee! There are millions of people today who are hearing the message concerning God’s kingdom and they are being urged to study the Word of God. But most of them push it aside as of no account. In Jesus’ day he preached for three and a half years and he sent his disciples out to preach too. Be sure that you do not get yourself into a situation like those persons who lived in Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum. They had an opportunity to hear the truth, but they would not change their course of action. They could have become disciples of Jesus back there, but they missed out on the calling to share in the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today you can become his followers too, true Christians, and share in the preaching of God’s kingdom. Read the account in Matthew 11:20-24, and you will see what Jesus said about consequences. There he said that in the resurrection it will be much better for the people of Tyre, Sidon and Sodom, to whom Jesus never preached, than for those persons to whom Jesus did preach in Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum. It was in these cities that Jesus did many of his powerful works, but they did not repent and follow him. Now, when the resurrection takes place for all these people, as it will for the thief who heard Jesus say, “You will be with me in Paradise,” what is going to happen? Jesus gave the answer to those of Chorazin and Bethsaida: “It will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgment Day than for you.” And to those in Capernaum: “It will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day than for you.”—Matt. 11:22, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It appears from Jesus’ statement that those of Tyre, Sidon and Sodom will repent and accept the provisions to gain life more quickly than will the Jews who had seen the powerful works that took place in their cities when Jesus was there with them. What about the people in Christendom and elsewhere today in this twentieth century? What are their prospects?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE EDUCATION FOR LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never in the history of mankind has such a tremendous witness been given concerning the kingdom of God as in the last twenty years. Jehovah through his Son Christ Jesus declared that “this good news of the kingdom” would be preached, and Jehovah’s witnesses feel their responsibility and have gone preaching. Twenty years ago throughout the earth there were only 128,976 persons telling out the good news of the Kingdom in 6,727 congregations located in sixty-two lands. In the service year of 1964 throughout the earth there were on the average each month 1,001,870 who shared in that same proclamation work, and a new peak in Kingdom proclaimers of 1,075,523 was reached. These witnesses of Jehovah were located in 194 different lands. They spent 162,808,312 hours preaching the “good news of the kingdom” from God’s Book of truth, the Holy Bible. Further, they made 55,954,267 return visits to the homes of the people and also conducted 741,367 home Bible studies each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to help the people get better acquainted with the Word of God, Jehovah’s witnesses left with those interested 4,553,282 books and 13,181,871 booklets. Additionally, they obtained 1,551,436 subscriptions for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines and placed a combined total of 127,055,165 individual copies of these magazines. The Society’s printeries produced 111,194,768 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and 104,003,980 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That people listened to their message is evidenced by this fact: 1,809,476 met on Saturday, March 28, 1964, for the celebration of the Lord’s death, the Memorial, in 23,483 congregations throughout the world, though only 11,953 partook of the Memorial emblems, signifying they were a part of the remaining members of Christ’s bride here on earth. For the detailed report on what has been going on in different countries of the world, please see pages 36-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this you see thousands upon thousands of persons that withdrew from Babylon the Great. They are fleeing. They do not want to wait until the Judgment Day to make then first their decision on whether they will serve God or not. By delay they could be caught in Babylon’s destruction and be destroyed forever with her. So they are hearing the “everlasting good news” and doing something about it. They have taken up the ministry. Just last year there were 68,236 persons baptized, showing that they have dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will. They want to preach as Jesus preached. Therefore, they repented of their evil ways and turned around. They do not want to be like the people of Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum, whose reforming after their resurrection will be more difficult than that of those coming back from Sodom and Gomorrah. Maybe, because of their stubborn disposition then when Jesus was on the earth nineteen hundred years ago, they will show an even worse disposition when raised from the dead and they will be more resentful of what is taking place. That will not be disturbing to those who want to do good things so as to have their resurrection, when they are brought forth from the memorial tombs, prove to be one of life.</span></p>

But the sinner, doing bad things one hundred times, or as long as he pleases, will be permitted to go</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">strong in Jehovah and be determined to do his will. What is your answer to the question: Does your worship to God come first? If it is Yes, then you will be able to say to the whole world: “Your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.” Why so? Because you are not “fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul,” but, rather, you are fearful of “him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“FRUITAGE OF THE SPIRIT” ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The yearly convention for Jehovah’s witnesses is one of the outstanding events of each year. In the summer of 1964 “Fruitage of the Spirit” was the theme of the convention program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first assemblies were held in Luton, Bedfordshire, in the British Isles, and in Siegen, Germany, June 11-14. From then on in different parts of the world these four-day assemblies brought great joy to God’s servants. The series of “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies in the United States began late in June, the 25th to the 28th, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with a public meeting attendance of 32,433.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Week after week throughout all of North America and Europe thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses would converge on the cities selected for the assemblies. In the continental United States alone there were thirty-six such assemblies, the last one being held in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in the latter part of August. In just about two months there was a total attendance of 305,619 at the public meetings. Thrilling to all in the United States was the baptismal service, where 4,327 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. In Germany there were 25 assemblies and the total attendance was 82,397. Canada had 26 assemblies, with 57,769 in attendance. These were all small conventions held during the summer of 1964. At the time of going to press reports were received from 49 countries that had 231 assemblies, and 10,672 persons were baptized. The total attendance at all these public meetings was 681,550.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding was the program itself, which was the same at each convention. On the opening day, Thursday, love, joy, peace and long-suffering, fruitage of the spirit, were discussed. During the evening session an excellent service meeting was presented. This was followed by another program using the Society’s publications to find answers to Bible questions. Some excellent proof was given to show how the Greek Scriptures support the Hebrew Scriptures. On Friday morning, in most places, there was a baptismal program, and a special meeting arranged for district and circuit servants as well as for pioneers was held. Other fruits of the spirit, such as kindness and faith, were discussed. Following the theocratic ministry school came one of the outstanding talks, “Jerusalem—‘A Burdensome Stone to All the Peoples.’ ” This was a thrilling discourse, and the information has been printed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> for our careful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saturday afternoon everyone’s interest was aroused when talks were delivered on the subjects “Passing Over from Death to Life” and “Out of the Tombs to a Resurrection.” It certainly was a new thought that the scripture, “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment,” indicated that on earth there would be just two general classes distinguished from each other by the outcome of their course of action </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font5"> they are resurrected. It will be the things that they do on earth after resurrection into the new system of things that will determine whether they were resurrected to life or to adverse judgment. This caused many lively conversations right after these talks. All wanted to know more, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> will soon bring out more information on this matter of the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saturday evening the talk “Keeping the Organization of Public Servants Pure, Chaste” made parents sit up and take notice as well as their teen-age children. Everyone in attendance received some very straightforward, practical information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday the outstanding feature of the convention was the public address “ ‘Peace on Earth Among Men of Good Will’ or Armageddon— Which?” This lecture has already been distributed by the millions all over the world through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and in booklet form. It has brought great comfort to those who are now “men of good will” as Jehovah’s ordained ministers. A number of translations of Luke 2:14 were read that gave this thought: ‘Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased.’ So it is that Jehovah God is pleased with his servants in the earth who have publicly symbolized a complete dedication of their lives to their God by water baptism. What a good thing it is to know that we have become God’s “men of good will,” enjoying his peace!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having this wonderful series of assemblies in all parts of the earth in the smaller cities gave the message of God’s kingdom and Jehovah’s Christian witnesses wide publicity. Many remarks were made by public officials about our fine organization, such as this one by the mayor of Great Falls, Montana. On visiting the Fairgrounds during the convention he said: “Your organization is tremendous. I am very impressed. What a lot of good hard work and what a vast change was made in the interiors of these rooms!” Of course, Jehovah’s witnesses did a lot of scrubbing down of the walls and thoroughly cleaned the facilities, because they always like to meet in clean buildings to praise their God Jehovah. In Jacksonville, Florida, the captain of the police force said he had been on duty in that city for nineteen years working with religious gatherings, Catholic and Protestant, and handling evangelistic meetings, and that he usually found that such gatherings gave his men a great amount of trouble. But he said: “Jehovah’s witnesses have not so much as spoken an unkind word to anyone of the officers.” An opportunity was afforded to explain why Jehovah’s witnesses are so different and a splendid witness was given. The mayor of Columbus, Ohio, said in a letter: “It was an honor to have the Watchtower Convention in our city. You brought a lot of wonderful people into our city and I know your efforts lifted the spiritual moral fiber of our community.” In El Paso, Texas, the management of the grounds used by Jehovah’s witnesses asked if Jehovah’s witnesses would consider conducting a regular Bible service each Sunday with their employees. It seems that for about six months during the year there are over three hundred trainers, grooms and helpers who live at the race track and who are restricted to the stable area, with no visitors allowed. So the manager thought it would be a fine thing if Jehovah’s witnesses came in there at least once a week and studied the Bible with these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assemblies certainly provided a rich blessing for all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Not only did they enjoy the spiritual food provided at the conventions through Jehovah’s visible organization, but they enjoyed the wonderful association with their fellow workers in Kingdom service, all of whom are striving to bring forth the fruits of the spirit. When these fruits of the spirit are shown, as they are in the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses, it certainly makes Jehovah’s witnesses’ conventions different from worldly conventions. Assemblies are a real asset, and year by year the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania arranges for conventions in different parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now we look forward with keen interest to the 1965 assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERSEERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a religious corporation and has been in operation for over eighty years, ever since November 12, 1884. Each year the members of this Society elect a board of directors, and the board of directors elects the officers. The president of the Society appoints branch servants and other servants in various nations of the earth so that the work can be directed there in the respective languages of the nations. Thousands upon thousands of congregations have been established in the cities around the world, and overseers, or congregation servants, are appointed to direct the work of the publishers, the ministers of God who preach the good news of the Kingdom everywhere. The organization is theocratic in structure. Everyone recognizes Jehovah God as his Teacher, just as Jesus Christ did: “It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me.” (John 6:45) Jehovah’s witnesses around the world look to Jehovah God for guidance and direction, and this they know will come to them through their very careful study of the Bible. One thing that distinguishes Jehovah’s witnesses from all other people is their firm belief in the Word of God, their very careful study of it and their living by its principles. Outstanding in the Bible is the message that the only hope for mankind is God’s kingdom. This they preach with the same earnestness that Jesus did, declaring that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The overseers, be they branch servants, district servants, circuit servants, overseers in congregations or book study conductors in the congregations, all of these along with the congregation of ministers preach the good news. The only difference between an overseer and the other ministers in the congregation is that the overseer has more responsibility. But all of them together are God’s ministers. All of Jehovah’s witnesses are ordained by Jehovah God to be his ministers. Believing in Christ Jesus as the Son of God and accepting the ransom sacrifice that he provided, they come under the same charge that Jesus came under, as expressed in Isaiah 61:1, 2: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, for the reason that Jehovah has anointed me to tell good news to the meek ones. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to those taken captive and the wide opening of the eyes even to the prisoners; to proclaim the year of good will on the part of Jehovah and the day of vengeance on the part of our God; to comfort all the mourning ones.” This Jehovah’s witnesses do in the same manner that Christ Jesus did nineteen hundred years ago. What a glorious work all the ministers of God are engaged in and what a happy time they have under the organizational arrangement of overseers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no end of the training that these ministers of God receive in the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world. In all congregations there is in operation the theocratic ministry school. Here every minister of God gets special training in how to present the good news of the Kingdom. He gets counsel as to his manner of speech and how to present Biblical, logical arguments supporting the truth. This is a school that every one of Jehovah’s witnesses in all countries attends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there is another school called the Kingdom Ministry School, especially organized for the training of overseers. And there is Gilead School, which the Society operates in order to give special training to individuals who enter the missionary field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On November 25, 1963, the 38th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead graduated. It was time for them to turn their minds homeward, or to a new missionary assignment. There were fifty-three married brothers in the class whose wives had agreed that they could attend this school alone for ten months in order that they might advance in privileges of service as far as God’s Kingdom work is concerned. The wives of these brothers continued working in their own countries as special pioneers or in the branch offices, and now they would soon be united again to carry on their ministry together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The graduation day was an outstanding event for all the 103 students. On Monday afternoon, November 25, at three o’clock the Kingdom Hall at 107 Columbia Heights was packed out. The president of the Society opened the meeting. The Kingdom Hall looked different because of the beautiful floral decoration that had been arranged on the platform. There was a large world map covering the wall to the right of the platform, showing the land areas. The map was watched constantly during the distribution of the diplomas because these students had come from fifty-four countries and now they were assigned to sixty-seven different lands, and some to the islands that also appeared on this large-scale map.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After brief counsel and farewell messages from the four Gilead instructors and from the factory servant and the Bethel servant, who had worked closely with the students in the practical training program, Brother F. W. Franz, the Society’s vice-president, spoke on the destruction of Babylon the Great and the urgency to help persons flee from it now while God allows opportunity before he destroys it. Then Brother Knorr gave the graduation talk on the need to “pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us,” especially now when God is speaking to us by means of his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things. Then each of the 103 graduates came to the platform to receive an envelope, 92 qualifying for diplomas of merit. After the regular Bethel </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study that evening, the students gave farewell comments and enacted a few scenes typifying everyday life in their countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A resolution presented by the graduating class expressed appreciation for the Gilead School instruction, and it also described the unity and integration of the school course with the practical training at headquarters as it went on to say: “We think ... of those who so patiently and kindly trained us in the factory, office and the home, ... in one way or another, every member of the Bethel family has had a share in our training and education, and . . . we would like to thank all of them . . . for the putting up with our efforts in love.” It concluded with the resolve that, “with Jehovah’s help, . . . the benefits of the Gilead School will reach to many more than just the 103 students of this class, ‘in order that,’ as Paul expressed it, ‘the undeserved kindness which was multiplied should abound because of the thanksgiving of many more to the glory of God.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During the next few days practically all the students were on their way to their foreign assignments. While these were leaving, many of the students for the next class were coming in, especially those needing help in English. Members of the Bethel family, both brothers and sisters, volunteered to teach them evenings every week and on Saturdays and Sundays so that they might get special training in English for approximately eleven hours a day. The two months spent studying English moved fast and soon all the other members of the school were arriving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Monday, February 3, 1964, found all the scheduled students of the 39th class, 104 in number, on hand from 54 lands. Most arrived several days ahead and had become settled in their rooms and were familiar with the general Bethel routine. They had also been taken on a tour of the Bethel home and factory by Brother Knorr on the previous Wednesday. So this opening day was occupied in outlining the courses and getting acquainted with one another. The students gave short talks in the classes. Brother Knorr addressed the student body at the regular lecture period after dinner. In the evening all enjoyed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, which was followed by an informal presentation of comments and experiences from the new students. The 39th class is a mature group, averaging 35 years of age and 16.5 years in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special treat for the 39th class was two days at the World’s Fair. These visits constituted two of the ten or more tours of interesting and educational places in New York City that are arranged each school term. In these tours members of the Bethel family serve as experienced guides and after each tour conduct an oral review on things observed. Then the school gives a written examination as part of the practical training to increase powers of observation and broaden the scope of the students’ knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of the service year was the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assembly at Atlantic City. The class attended for the four days and a good number participated in the talks and demonstrations on the program. Those from foreign lands helped the convention news department to present the international aspect of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses to the public by taking part in several radio interviews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The students of each class and the congregations in New York City share a fine interchange of encouragement and upbuilding as they unitedly carry on their ministry in this metropolitan city. This year the students were assigned to work with twenty-six of the New York City units of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom Ministry School in the United States has now completed five years of instruction, 1959 to 1964. During this time a grand total of 4,456 have completed the training course. Of these, 366 were sisters and 4,090 were brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom Ministry School is still in operation in England, Germany and a number of other countries where all the congregation servants and some special pioneers have not yet gone through the training. The one-month special course on spiritual as well as organizational matters has been most beneficial to the overseers attending, and what they have learned has been reflected in the congregations of Jehovah’s ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many brothers send letters to the school expressing their appreciation. One writes: “It seems just like two weeks ago that I was at the Kingdom Ministry School, but really it was two years since I was there. What a wonderful thing Jehovah has provided in this school! My mind goes back to the very first evening when all the class were welcomed. I wondered how we would be able to retain all the information that was going to be given to us, and that we did receive in the next four weeks. We were told to pay attention and to absorb as much as we could and then the holy spirit in the days to come would bring these things to mind. How true this has been! Many of the ideas, illustrations, principles and thoughts on the many subjects discussed come fresh to the mind almost word for word as the need arises. How thankful we are to Jehovah for his goodness!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many more interesting letters have been received along this same line, expressing appreciation. Congregation servants who have gone to the school have learned one thing in particular, that they must keep up to date week by week on all the new things that come out through the Society’s publications, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> and other publications of the Society. Jehovah’s witnesses are a forward-moving organization. They do not stand still. Those who attend the congregation meetings throughout the world are alive to their privileges of service and all are grateful for their overseers, and especially for the extra help that the Society gives to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 315,568 Population: 187,589,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 594</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A tremendous witness was given in the United States of America during the 1964 service year. The quickest way to observe this is to look at the number of hours spent in the field ministry, namely, 47,452,222 hours of preaching. This was accomplished because there were more special pioneers, more regular pioneers and more congregation publishers in the field work. Jehovah’s witnesses had the opportunity of working nearly a full year with the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!,</span><span class="font5"> and it appears that the publishers took delight in distributing this. More bound books were placed than during the previous year, and another outstanding figure was the total number of new subscriptions obtained and the total magazines distributed. The more the brothers do in the field work preaching the good news, the greater is the activity at the Bethel home in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family was very happy to be kept so busy by the requests for literature that came from around the world as well as the United States. Here are some experiences that have come in with the United States of America branch report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some large cities apartment houses are difficult to work. Tension, fear and crime cause people to refuse to open their doors. Often, too, superintendents will not allow apartments to be worked. Desiring to work an apartment house, a brother and sister in Massachusetts decided to contact the superintendent and request permission to work the apartments. The superintendent was receptive to the brief witness and explanation of the importance of our ministry. Taking advantage of his favorable attitude, the publishers asked permission to witness in the apartment building. The superintendent said: “I have no objection to your calling on the people, but it won’t do any good. They are so afraid they won’t open the door for strangers.” The first thought of the publishers was that this was an excuse. However, he went on to say: “Perhaps if I went along with you it would help. Would that be all right?” Surprised, but happy, they accepted his offer. At each door he would knock and say: “I have some people here who have a good message for you. Perhaps you might like to listen to them.” Doors opened! A brief witness would be given. For two hours the superintendent accompanied them to a total of sixty-four doors. Twenty-eight magazines and six booklets were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man studying at a Chicago theological seminary was contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses in the early spring of 1963. Before this he had had difficulty trying to harmonize traditional church teachings with the Bible. Reared a Methodist, he had from early childhood looked for a religion in which to pursue a career of the ministry, investigating everything from Congregationalists to Mennonites. He was able to recite long passages of Scripture and, when one of Jehovah’s witnesses called on him and opened up to him an understanding of the Scriptures, he readily recognized the truth. It took only one visit to the Kingdom Hall to convince him that he had found the truth that sets men free. The congregation was preparing for an assembly. He was invited. At the circuit assembly a pioneer invited him to go in the field ministry. That was the beginning. In June 1963 he was immersed. The first six months as a dedicated brother, as a regular publisher he devoted 80 hours each month in the field service. He started pioneering in January 1964, and his monthly average for eight months is 135 hours, 139 magazines, 72 back-calls and 8 Bible studies. He serves where the need is great in Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes the question is asked, Is the truth strong enough to aid drug addicts to overcome the habit? One of many experiences to show the power of the truth in this regard is that of a young man in New York who had been taking dope since he was sixteen years old. He had turned to drugs to escape the problems of the world and his own personal problems. After being addicted, he tried to break the habit, but without success. One night he met an old friend who had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. For two hours they talked, and a Bible study was arranged that lasted a few months. A couple of years later, high on drugs one day, as he wandered along a crowded city street he saw a sister doing street work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> brought back memories. He approached the sister, took a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and told her he used to study. The sister made arrangements to call on him with her husband. A study was started. Two months later he stopped taking drugs and after eight months of study he dedicated his life to Jehovah and was baptized. As a result of his breaking the habit after nine years of drug addiction, his brother and sister-in-law became interested in the truth and studied. The sister-in-law is now dedicated and baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have been minor interferences with the Kingdom preaching in seventeen states. Very few of these developed into arrests. In fact, there were only seven arrests, but many threats of arrests. Only one arrest resulted in a conviction. The decision by the Federal District Court of Arizona on the national anthem case at the close of the 1962-63 service year was used effectively in dealing with similar cases in other states. The Society won some fine decisions in the courts of Georgia and Washington in connection with building Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blood issue was in the front lines. Two cases were taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jones</span><span class="font4"> case in Washington, D.C., and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Anderson </span><span class="font4">case in New Jersey. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear these two cases. Except for these minor skirmishes, we can say that Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States have a free course to preach the good news of the Kingdom, and the brothers are taking full advantage of their opportunities. In this we rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING ACTIVITIES IN BROOKLYN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the zealous activity on the part of the publishers worldwide, there was a steady hum of machinery in the Society’s publishing plant in Brooklyn. In fact, it was necessary to install two new high-speed web rotary printing presses in our Brooklyn plant this year. These were ordered over three years ago and were delivered just this past fall. These will come in handy, because during the past year the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine production in Brooklyn alone increased over nine million copies. While there was a slight drop in the production of bound books, the demand for books was very great, and our shipping figures show that 344,000 more books were shipped out of the Brooklyn plant than during the previous year. This reduces our inventory and gives us a little more space for operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> is still going very well, and during the year we had the privilege of printing 895,497 copies, bringing the grand total for this book up to 4,220,222 since its release in June 1961. Due to the demand in the field, it became necessary to complete 1,643,471 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font4"> books. Another item of interest concerns the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font4"> It was necessary to print another two million copies this year to supply the demand, and now the total production has grown to the amazing total of 43,446,072 copies printed in the Brooklyn plant alone in over eighty languages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Carloads of raw material continue to flow into our plant. We used 9,141 tons of paper in our factory. We made 237,891 pounds of ink and 187,357 pounds of paste and glue, besides making our own rollers for our presses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one looks at the work that has been accomplished in the plant one is truly amazed that, on the average, 673 persons, brothers and sisters of the Bethel home, were able to take care of all the activity. Of course, not everyone runs a press, nor does everyone work in the bindery. Many of the workers are in the offices, kitchen, dining room, laundry and in the housekeeping departments. All know their work and are trained to handle it efficiently. Along with this large family there are 101 Gilead students who go to school every day but who also receive special training in the Bethel home, factory and offices. All the members of the Bethel family belong to one of the 156 congregations in New York City, and many enjoy privileges of service as congregation servants, ministerial servants or study conductors, and they keep themselves very busy in the field in addition to the eight hours and forty minutes they spend each day at their work in Bethel. The Bethel family is very grateful for its privileges of service. They delight to serve their fellow ministers worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT ON OTHER TERRITORIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is good to see another fine witness given in some of the outlying territories under the jurisdiction of the United States branch. Here are some experiences on what is going on in Bermuda, Guam, Saipan and Sudan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 108 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 463</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many times persons are helped in some indirect way as they study the Scriptures with Jehovah’s witnesses. A person who had a bad speech problem had to write her name before it could be understood. However, magazines were placed and a study started. It was quite noticeable that the woman stuttered less and less each week and was finally able to express herself more clearly. She was soon attending meetings, and after four months of study she was participating in the house-to-house ministry. Now she has no difficulty in giving a good magazine presentation and makes many placements. Due to her interest, a study is also being held with her sister, who now attends meetings regularly and has started publishing the good news. As this publisher expressed herself: “I feel that the truth has really given me courage and a reason to overcome my problem.” She is looking forward to being baptized at our next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After a year without assemblies, the two held in 1964 were greatly appreciated. The last one was a district assembly at which the final day’s attendance of 208 represented almost double the number of publishers in Bermuda. On this occasion the Society’s new film was shown to over 300 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44,892</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 67 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 670</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the first call the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> was placed with the husband and subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> were obtained. Of course, the brother called back to bring the magazines until the man’s own copies came through the mail. This brought opposition from the wife, and it grew until the husband wrote a letter to the brother telling him not to call anymore. However, some time later the missionaries met the husband again and a study was started. Then the missionaries moved to another assignment, which made the wife very happy. Soon, though, the missionaries returned and the study was resumed. During all this time the husband showed patience and kindness toward his wife. He knew his wife had a good heart, because whenever he went to his study or to a meeting his clothes were laid out for him, ready to wear. Every night the wife would pray before her images and she would call her husband to join her, but he would not do so. Now the wife began to pray along these lines: “If my husband is wrong, call him back to the Catholic faith. If I am wrong I will go with him to Jehovah’s witnesses.” Her prayers were answered. She attended the circuit assembly, and after this a study was started. The whole family was together now. Although the missionaries conducting the study were sent to another assignment, the study was continued by another missionary. In August 1964, seven years from the time of their first association, these folks symbolized their dedication by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our report would not be complete without telling of the visit of the Guam overseer to the outlying islands in the Trust Territory. This brother and his wife have done excellent work while serving in the South Pacific, witnessing to people on twelve different islands, orally and with the literature, and placing many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font4">books. During this trip, which took fifty-three days and covered 4,749 miles, the Society’s film was shown many times, much literature was placed, public talks were held and a good witness given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAIPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,404</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,401</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A back-call was made on a young person who showed interest. Many of her neighbors were there when the call was made, so the publisher took advantage of the opportunity to give a witness to all present. One of the neighbors invited the publisher to visit her home. On the initial call the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book was placed and a Bible study was started. She was always punctual and studied regularly each week, not even letting sickness interfere with her studies. This neighbor progressed very well and discussed the truths with her husband. One day she told the publisher that her husband was also interested in what she was learning each week. Knowing this, the publisher made it a point to study with both the husband and wife. Even though this interested person has been a devout Catholic she has accepted all the truths of the Bible taught her thus far and has already accepted the fact that images are not a part of true worship, even though she has prayed to images many times to get well. Obviously, they did not help her. Now she knows why. Both this woman and her husband have already witnessed to many of their relatives and friends, who have, in turn, shown much interest and have started studying the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SUDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,470,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 283,409</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports continue to come through regularly from the little congregation of Kingdom publishers in Sudan. During the year it was possible for a traveler to visit the brothers and work with the group as circuit servant for a week, and this was a great spiritual encouragement to them all. He reported that the brothers have been doing little door-to-door work, to avoid difficulties during the time the government was forcing various mission groups out of the country due to suspected political activity. However, the brothers have been encouraged to continue the house-to-house activity tactfully, avoiding becoming involved in discussions with those objecting to the good news. As a result, the work continues and the brothers are in good spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The congregation showed some good increase during the year, and for the Memorial they were able to gather in a good hall, where fifty-three came to hear the talk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The day before Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in Alaska to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal the south-central portion of Alaska was rocked by one of the most violent earthquakes on record. Notwithstanding this disaster, 859 of the brothers and their Bible students and other interested persons came together to observe the Memorial of Christ’s death. Most of them assembled under emergency conditions, using coal-oil lamps or candlelight in their Kingdom Halls or assembly places. All were grateful to Jehovah for this privilege to gather together in memory of their Savior’s death and to prepare to go out from house to house and share the life-giving message that they had with others who need so much comfort in these trying times. Our brothers in Alaska enjoyed many interesting experiences, and here are a few that were sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At one of our circuit assemblies in the spring when the Society’s film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” was featured much interest was shown. Attendance on Saturday evening was 471, with about 200 of these being strangers. This means that nearly half the audience was people who came to see and learn about Babylon, that city in ruins, and how its history has affected their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publicity attending the film showing did not go unnoticed by the clergy. One of the interested persons reports on a meeting conducted by the local Catholic priest the following Monday night. Here the question was raised as to where the Witnesses get their zeal. In answering the question the priest confessed he did not know where such zeal came from, or how they could stand on street corners at forty degrees below zero. Nor did he know how they could be talked to rudely and continue to smile. He then read to the group the newspaper article about the assembly that gave the attendance at the film and at the public talk on Sunday. He said he could not help but be astounded “at the number gathered just to see a movie, in a town this size.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes the brothers in Alaska gather the fruit that others have planted, as the following experience relates: When an interested person arrived in Juneau the first thing she wanted </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> do was to see the Kingdom Hall. Arrangements were made to continue the study in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font4"> and in time her husband joined the study. In the meantime the interested person was doing incidental witnessing among her neighbors, placing the New World Translation Bible with one. Since the next lesson dealt with the right motive for serving God, the publisher invited her to go in the service with her. She was delighted with this, as she felt that just a few minutes spent in talking about Jehovah was not enough. She enjoys the meetings for field service now and the comments of the brothers in discussing the daily text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 22,501,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,374 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,169</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conditions have not been the best in Argentina during the past year. There have been much strife and discontent among those who wish for better government. However, Jehovah’s witnesses take advantage of this situation and press on diligently preaching the good news of God’s kingdom, which is really the only hope for the world. There was a good increase in Witnesses in Argentina. Many have been gathered out of Babylon the Great and have associated themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses in true worship. On coming out of the Catholic system of religion, many do not at first appreciate what clean living means, and some people do not worry too much about their marital status. However, when they learn the truth it changes them, as Paul said it would. (1 Cor. 6:9-11) Here is an experience illustrating this point along with others that show how well the witness work is carried on in Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special pioneers were sent to a very beautiful assignment at the foot of the snowcapped Andes mountains. In this paradisaic spot people with a sheeplike disposition were found. The special pioneer had to walk ten kilometers to take care of them, but progress was rapid. Soon they wanted to start telling the truth to others, but the Scriptures showed them they had to straighten out their marriage life first and then they could set the proper example for others. This they did. There are thirteen in the family, four are baptized and others are progressing well. This was done with Jehovah’s blessing in just ten months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The vacation and regular pioneer work was stressed in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> at assemblies and by the circuit servants. Many were the congregations that had ten, fifteen and twenty vacation pioneers in the month of April. There were 2,164 brothers that had part in vacation pioneer work. In a congregation of forty publishers, ten took part in the vacation pioneer work. Many new studies were started, with excellent results. One brother encourages all to enjoy the vacation pioneer service. He says it is not hard to reach the goal of hours. Tn less than two weeks I had already reached my goal of 75 hours, placing 27 books, 126 booklets, 152 magazines and making 21 back-calls. I recommend the pioneer service for all. It brings joy and one feels better equipped to serve Jehovah and able to help the interested people.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How true are the words of Solomon in Proverbs 25: 11: “As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it”! The following experience shows how true this is: “I always talked the truth when appropriate in my secular work. Many of my fellow workers listened, but there was a Catholic who would never talk. One day I was talking about Mary, the mother of Jesus. This was the word at the right time. This man belonged to the ‘Legion of Mary.’ He believed in Mary as the ‘mother of God.’ I explained that this could not be. ‘How can God have a mother?’ After our talk on this matter he said that he was going to talk to the priest, which he did; but he did not receive a satisfying answer. Every night for one week we studied the Catholic Bible together. Finally convinced, he was then confronted with a new problem—his family. Would he be able to face it? Yes, with the newly acquired knowledge he did, and today he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Take advantage, brothers, of every opportunity and do incidental witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus said: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.” How true this is in this experience! A thirteen-year-old witness always talked about the truth when playing with a little neighbor girl. The parents of the girl heard and inquired about the truth. They appreciated the good discipline and education of the young Witness. Questions were asked and answered until the parents of the young Witness were able to start a Bible study. After two studies this family, because of work, moved 3,000 kilometers from this place and 136 from the nearest group of special pioneers, but the study was carried on by correspondence. The special pioneers visited them and aided them more in their knowledge. When the circuit servant visited the group of special pioneers, the woman and two children made the trip to be there just for the visit. She took part in all features of the work and will be baptized at the next district assembly. Out of the mouth of babes comes forth praise. Parents, teach your children to talk the truth to their playmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This report would not be complete without saying something about the new film. Many are the comments persons have made after seeing it at the circuit assemblies. One elderly man said: ‘This is the kind of film I like to see. At last I have found the true worship! I saw it with my own eyes.’ The chief of police in another place said: ‘We never have anything educational here, nothing more than dances and fights. But this is something different.’ The brothers and kindly disposed people express their appreciation for the uncovering of the false religion, Babylon the Great, in the film. They always express their appreciation for the good work done by the Society in helping them see the truth more clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTEAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,950,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17,039 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 643</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in this land “down under” expressed their appreciation for the new film, the book “AZZ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font5"> book. During the last four months of the service year they were using the Society’s new film, and this not only stimulated the publishers of the Kingdom, but other honest-hearted people were aroused to look more closely into the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses as taught in God’s Word, the Bible. No matter where one goes witnessing in the world he has very interesting experiences, and the Australian office has sent in a number. For example, how would you like to be halted in the middle of your introductory remarks at the door of the householder and have the <a name="bookmark154"></a><a name="bookmark155"></a>householder tell you that he stuck to only one religion, and that was Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is what happened to two of our special pioneers who are working in the outback territory of Australia. After travelling many miles through sand and saltbush country, they came across a station homestead where they were told just that. How did this man come to be of this frame of mind in this place miles from anywhere? It was as a result of the letter writing of an old sister in one of the country towns of Australia, a sister who is not able to go from door to door now. The two special pioneers were able to stay with the family for the night and show them slides of the conventions around the world, thus directing their attention to the organization. This certainly shows the importance of the letter writing of the older brothers and sisters among us who are not able to go from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The value of being filled with Jehovah’s holy spirit and speaking the word with boldness was demonstrated by two sisters who were going from door to door one Sunday morning in a Catholic area and who suddenly found, on coming out of one of the homes, that they were surrounded by a mob of leather-jacketed hooligans who had just jumped out of a car together with a priest. This rather surprised the sisters, and the priest came toward them with the words: &quot;Stop preaching to these people; they’re my people.” One of the sisters who knew very little English meekly and yet courageously answered: “They’re not your people; they’re God’s people.” The priest threatened to have them beaten up by the hooligans; so one of the sisters pointed out that Jesus gave the command to love your neighbours as yourself. The priest grew very hot-tempered and yelled: “For the love of heaven, don’t preach to me.” Very quickly the sister answered: “If you loved heaven you would be doing this preaching yourself.” By this time a large crowd had gathered and the people were listening to the conversation. The priest was very embarrassed because the people were laughing. So he told them to go home, but when they continued to stay, the priest continued to try to make the sisters look like fools. He noticed a baby sitting on the ground and said: “Look, if you want to preach to someone, preach to that baby.” With Jehovah’s spirit upon the sister once again, she answered: “How can that baby understand what I am saying if you, a grown man, don’t understand?” This was too much for the priest, so he jumped into his car with his hooligans and drove off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sisters felt so uplifted and the people were so nice that, with Jehovah’s spirit upon the sisters, they continued to press forward courageously. They felt very much like the apostles Peter and John, who were ordered to stop preaching but who took the same stand, obeying God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The value of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font4"> book has become very evident, even in assisting families who have been inactive for many years. One family that was in this category had the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font4"> book placed with them, and the family head, upon reading this very revealing book, realized how close to the end of this system we were and also realized the obligation that was resting upon him as a family head to do something about it and to assist his family to become active with Jehovah’s organization once again. Within a few weeks after reading the book, the family began to attend the group study and to come along to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study on Sundays. Now the whole family of nine attend regularly. The publisher who made the contact and placed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font4"> book suggested that he study with them, and because they felt they had slipped back so badly, one study a week was not enough. Now the brother who is nursing them back to maturity and activity once again studies with them for one hour beginning at 6:45 a.m. on Thursdays as well as every Saturday evening. What a joy it is to see our brothers come to life again spiritually as a result of the “meat in due season” served from Jehovah’s table!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has drawn to the attention of the publishers over a period of time that it is good, if possible, to make contact with the unbelieving marriage partners of those who are in the congregations. One congregation followed through diligently on this advice, as they had six sisters in the congregation with opposed husbands. As a result of putting the Society’s suggestion into operation, there are now four of these husbands associating with the congregation and one of them is already dedicated, with the other three doing well in having home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This certainly proves the point that it is always good to follow through and try to encourage the unbelieving marriage partners to see the reason behind the course of action followed by their mates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently we have been endeavouring to enlarge the scope of the work being done on ships coming to Australian ports, and the brothers now busily engaged in this work are having some very fine results. One brother, a pioneer, who regularly does this work now, has given thought to being well prepared. Because of the variety of crewmen met, from many different countries and many different religions, this pioneer has carefully studied the backgrounds of all the different false religions in order to be able to talk to them about their particular religion. This has impressed the seamen very much. As a result, one day when he was engaged in witnessing he offered the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription to one person and, just as he was filling in the subscription slip, another came in and inquired what was going on. When the Kingdom message was explained to him, he also subscribed and yet another came in and subscribed. Thus it continued until this brother had obtained six new subscriptions in ten minutes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">‘Assemble yourselves together.’ Jehovah’s witnesses in Austria believe this and they had five excellent district assemblies during the past summer, with a total attendance of 8,800. There were 199 baptized. Expression was made on the part of the branch, located in Vienna, that the brothers attending these assemblies certainly enjoyed the program. It reached the hearts of all—males, females, young and old. There was a message for everyone. At the close of these assemblies it was announced that Vienna would be the location of a large assembly in 1965, and it is felt that this will stimulate the work during the coming year. But even during the 1964 service year there were 590 persons baptized, giving evidence that a fine witness was given. Good experiences come from Austria, and here are two of them as sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About eighteen months ago a young man in whose home a Bible study had been conducted for a short time came to our branch office. He inquired about the possibilities of full-time service, attending Gilead School, and so forth. He was a medical student and wanted to know whether he should continue this study or quit it in order to begin sooner with his full-time service. But this question he answered quickly himself by saying: “As a doctor maybe I shall be able to prolong the present life of a few people, but in full-time service I might be able to help </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> number of persons to gain everlasting life.” Soon he was baptized; he attends every meeting, twice he was a vacation pioneer, and is now already in the regular pioneer service. He had the great joy not only of arousing in his parents, brothers and sister-in-law some interest in the truth, but six members of his family have already symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by baptism. Yes, by his unselfish and firm stand he has been able, within such a short time, to help quite a number to walk on the way of life. Nov? this young brother is striving for the special pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two sisters left a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> with a lady who had silently listened to their sermon. When calling again they were able to begin a Bible study with her. But from week to week the sisters were worrying because this lady has had Mormon preachers as lodgers in her house for years. However, the studies were really blessed. Then the daughter returned from England. What would happen now? This young girl was also certainly interested. She was already a baptized Mormon, but she knew hardly anything of the Bible and joined the home Bible study at once. Together with her mother she also attended every meeting and soon both of them began to publish God’s Word from house to house. But this young lady went to Australia, and the two sisters were again full of sorrow. Would she continue in the truth? Since then a few months have passed. Her joyful letters reported that she is closely connected with the congregation in Sydney, she attended the district assembly in Melbourne and was baptized there, and she is working only half a day for her living and is happy in the pioneer service! Also, her mother here in Austria is still faithful, and has also symbolized her dedication to our great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHAMAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130,721</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have a real challenge to meet in this part of the world because there are so many islands that need to be visited. There are approximately 33,000 persons living on the fifteen scattered islands of the Bahamas. Occasionally a pioneer or someone else gets to these islands and carries on the preaching activity, but we wish we could do it more often. Real interest is aroused when a publisher of the Kingdom gets to an island where the people have been enslaved to false re<a name="bookmark156"></a><a name="bookmark157"></a>ligion. The truth certainly causes a stir. Some very good experiences have been sent in by the branch office in the Bahamas. Here are a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Studying with persons by correspondence is beneficial. A missionary began a study with a man who lived on an “out island.” She prepared questions on one of the Society’s publications and he would answer them in his own words. It could be seen that he had understanding by his brief and to-the-point answers. He talked to others and reported service. On learning about the district assembly he determined to be baptized. He made the trip by boat, taking in the whole assembly and returning to his island as a dedicated, baptized publisher, to continue to preach the good news to the island’s inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Living immorally is so common in some parts of the world that many do not bother to get married legally. They just start living together. This, of course, does not meet the Bible’s high standards for Christians. A sincere woman began studying with one of Jehovah’s witnesses and soon realized that if she wanted to have God’s favor she would have to change her way of living. She was living with a man who was already married. After the fourth study she stated that she was looking for a house because she had asked the man to move out and he had made no effort to do so. The man she was living with could not understand why she was leaving him and also her church. She told him that she was studying the Bible now and knew that she could not be a Christian and live in adultery. He then asked her how she would provide for herself, offering her money. This she refused and said that Jehovah would provide. Two weeks later she found a room and the following day she found a job. Now that she has taken these important steps she has started out in the service. Where there is true love for God and his Word no obstacle is too great to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A missionary that is assigned to one of the “out islands” uses Bible discourses to good advantage. He gives a series of Bible discourses taken from the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> to which the public is invited. It came about this way. He started giving two talks a month to a small group of interested persons, and this resulted in a visit from the local priest and the usual warning. Did this scare this small group? Not in the least! In fact, they asked the brother to come back every Sunday and give them a talk. Now that he has finished all the chapters in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font4"> he has made arrangements to have a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study in addition to the book study that has been carried on regularly every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,326,126</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,294 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,124</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More time has been devoted to the ministry in Belgium than during any previous year, and with excellent results. The brothers have been very joyful. One of the outstanding events of the year was the release of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in the two main languages spoken in Belgium—French and Dutch. The people in Belgium responded very well to this new publication, and about 20,000 Bibles were placed in the first year. Some fine experiences have been reported from the branch office there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Caring for the spiritual needs of the “sheep” requires a keen interest on the part of the publisher. A sister started a magazine route with a woman, but no special interest was manifest. At the third visit the person abruptly told the sister: “I’m not interested, and if there was a God, he would certainly not allow all the troubles that we have today.” As the person was very nervous, it was not possible for the sister to answer her objection then. All she could do was promise to call back. The lady was reluctant to agree but did so in order to put an end to the conversation. The sister’s opening words at the back-call were: “If I insisted on calling back, it is because I really want to help you.” The lady told her that she regretted her attitude on the previous call and invited the sister indoors. The person reiterated her problem about God and the permission of evil, but this time in the form of a question. After hearing the Scriptural answer, she accepted two books, and a study was started. Her husband has since been contacted and both of them are now studying the Word of God and are attending the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A study was started with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> woman, but she asked the publisher to discontinue it because her husband was a Catholic and opposed to our religion. Since she had four children, the privilege of teaching them the truth was stressed, and her desire to continue the study was revived when the brother explained to her that her children would be “holy” if she could raise them up in the knowledge of the Scriptures, even if her husband did not appreciate the Bible truths. She decided to continue the study because of the encouragement received. The study took place in the evening during the husband’s working hours, but it was noticed by the two brothers conducting the study that she was not at ease, tearing all the time that her husband would come home unexpectedly. At this stage and in agreement with the lady, the two brothers decided to speak to the husband. They were amazed at his reaction when he heard the message. He was not at all opposed to the good news, but readily agreed to start a Bible study. Both are dedicated publishers now. This experience shows the importance of following the counsel of the Society to give a witness as soon as possible to husbands or any other member of the family who is thought to be indifferent or even opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we “go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside,” our conduct does not pass unobserved. This is a witness in itself and leads to greater opportunities of putting the good news across. In the office where </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> sister worked the other women used to converse on general topics during the lunch hour. One of her co-workers noticed that, when invited to give her comments, the sister would remain calm and did not always try to have the last word as did the others. This lady told the sister: “I wish I could react as you do, because I see that you are not like the others.” “It is my study of the Bible that has helped me to change my way of looking at things,” replied the sister, and she encouraged the lady to know more about Bible principles. After a series of conversations during their free time, the person accepted the magazines and was invited to attend a book study. Immediately she manifested the desire to have a Bible study. After a while, due to listening to the announcements at the Kingdom Hall about the preaching activity, she expressed the desire to participate in the field service. However, she and her companion, who was now also manifesting some interest in the truth, learned that they would have to straighten out their marital situation first. Appreciating the standpoint of the Scriptures, they immediately took steps to settle the matter. They wish to give a witness by their conduct in harmony with Scriptural principles and are now busy in their study of the Bible so as to be able to help others to know the truth through the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,604,000</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark159"></a>In many countries throughout the world there is much illiteracy due to the lack of interest on the part of the Roman Catholic Church in helping the people to learn to read and write. This is true in Bolivia. One of the special pioneers used the Society’s reading aid to help many persons gain a knowledge of the alphabet and to read and write Spanish as well as their native tongue, Aymara. Teaching individuals to read and write, and at the same time telling them about the truth and God’s kingdom and the marvelous provision Jehovah made for persons to gain life through the new system of things, certainly helps them to take a definite stand for the truth. After learning to read and write, a number of persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. Here is an experience on this point.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After my teaching a woman to read and write, as well as teaching her to explain Bible truths, she continued to make excellent progress in understanding the Bible, and it was not long before she symbolized her dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. This brought great joy to me. My happiness was even greater when one day she was able to give me the entire sermon that we were using in the field service. She was able to read the four scriptures fluently right out of the Bible. After making this bold forward step, at the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study the next week she made several comments, which proved definitely that she could read and prepare her studies in advance. Now this woman has joined the theocratic ministry school and she always takes her assignment, reading from the Bible when that is called for. True, it takes extra time to teach a person to read and write, but look at the results! Now not only is this one who has become one of Jehovah’s witnesses a student, but she has become a teacher as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Traveling throughout Bolivia, we see a tremendous amount of image worship. This was introduced by the Catholic Church when her Spanish conquerors inhabited the land. These lifeless, powerless gods have failed the people throughout the centuries, the big ones and the small ones alike. However, many of these images are found in the private homes of Catholics as well as in the religious temples. One man had twenty Catholic images; so when his son came to a knowledge of the truth, he explained to his father what the Bible has to say about images. Listening to his son’s explanation and recognizing the foolishness of worshiping images, one day the father gave the key to his home to his son and told him to go into his house, take out the images and destroy them. The son did, and when the father saw that the images were being pulverized and that they could not defend themselves he was more than convinced that what his son was telling him was the truth. The father studied the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book, attended meetings at the Kingdom Hall and was able to finish his days rejoicing in Jehovah God and the truth. Before he died he urged his son to continue in the good work he had started and to do Jehovah’s will faithfully. His father had confidence in the resurrection of the dead and wanted to see his son again in the new system of things. The son has continued his advancement in the ministry. He is now a servant in one of the congregations and has written to the office requesting an opportunity to engage in the special pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus it is seen that those who cannot read and write and those who have been bowing down before images have been brought to freedom through the truth from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 77,521,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Brazil now has 712 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses, and 65,000 people came together on the night of March 28, 1964, to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal. There is truly much interest manifest by the people of this nation. The publishers of the good news of the Kingdom are interested in the field, and in April there were 679 brothers and sisters who participated in the vacation pioneer service. In July the number increased to 836. Many interesting experiences have been received from the branch in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One congregation publisher reported that it was very difficult for her to get a home Bible study started. Then she took up the vacation pioneer work and in a month she had three studies going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another congregation publisher found it difficult to get a Bible study started and so she took up vacation pioneer work and got seven studies started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still another had difficulty in reaching the goal of twelve magazines a month, but when she vacation pioneered for a month she distributed 195 magazines. After</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">going back into the congregation publisher ranks again, during the first nine days she placed her twelve magazines. The vacation pioneer work makes congregation publishers more efficient and often fulfills their desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul writes that the word of God exerts power and is capable of making great changes in the lives of those who listen to its counsel. (Heb. 4:12) A publisher wrote of visiting an elderly woman who said she wanted nothing more from this world, had already bought her coffin and clothing to be buried in, including a “Saint Francis cord,” and was ready to die. The publisher pointed out the hope of life on a paradise earth, started a study, and now the woman has dismissed her thoughts of dying, has dedicated her life to Jehovah God, and is telling others of the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man of a traditional Japanese family learned the truth, but his father would not permit him to study the Bible in the home. He arranged to study the Bible in the Kingdom Hall with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but always with opposition from his family. He decided to take a job in another town to have more freedom for study, but his father demanded that he send most of what he earned to the family. He did this, but then later his father demanded double what he had been paying. He got an increase in pay that enabled him to pay this, although leaving him very little to live on. But as he learned more of the truth he had a great desire to spend all his time telling others about it. His father agreed to free him from the monthly payments if he would pay a large lump sum. He economized greatly and was finally able to pay the money to his family. Now he uses all his time to help others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another young man of a Protestant family has gone through similar family opposition. One time his father found his copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and tore it to bits. He painstakingly pasted it back together and continued to study. When he announced that he was going to an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses he was told not to return home, for, as far as the father was concerned, he no longer existed. He attended the assembly, symbolized his dedication to God by water baptism, and then returned home to get his things. But his determination to serve God had impressed his father and he told him he could continue in the home and also serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even children recognize the power of God’s Word. During a Bible study in the home a youngster was disturbing his mother, wanting to turn on the television when it had been forbidden by his father. The woman asked the publisher to explain this to the child. The publisher then explained to the child that the mother respected the father’s position as head of the home, that the father himself was subject to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, so the child should show subjection to the father and mother, for by doing this he was being obedient to God. This impressed the young mind, so the youngster sat down and paid close attention to the study. Thereafter, at each study he would have the book and Bible ready for his mother, and the child continues to pay close attention each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” began to be shown at circuit assemblies near the end of the service year, and it has already made a great impression. In a small circuit of only 180 publishers 900 attended the showing of the film. After seeing it, a Catholic man remarked: “Every Catholic should see this film, to see the great error we are in.” As the film is presented all over the country many thousands will get to see this plain exposure of Babylonish religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This country on the northern coast of South America has had a series of difficult times. The Georgetown business areas were burned down. There was a seventy-nine-day general strike in 1963. Acts of violence became more numerous, resulting in over 150 deaths and thousands of displaced persons. Through all the rioting and trouble on the part of the masses Jehovah’s witnesses kept on preaching the good news of God’s kingdom, showing those who would listen what the new system of things would be like after the battle of Armageddon. Because Jehovah’s witnesses would not join in with certain nationalistic parties many of the brothers were threatened and beaten and some of their homes were burned. Nevertheless, the truth continues to make advancement and the brothers rejoice in their privileges. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant in British Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one district some hundreds of people had to flee as a result of the race riots, leaving their homes and be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">longings behind. Among them was an East Indian brother, his wife and five children. A special pioneer family in another part of the country heard of this and sent a message to the branch, as follows: “On behalf of the group we would like to make a contribution of $5 to help defray Brother M----’s expenses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A pioneer wrote about a Hindu who obtained the first edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> some years ago. He was living with a consensual partner, a Muslim woman. They both learned much from the book and would compare what they learned with the religious radio programs, noting where the clergy differed from the Bible. Recently a study was started and the woman accepted the truth and wanted to serve Jehovah. But her partner continually delayed legalizing their union. Eventually, gaining spiritual strength through the study, the woman told the man she would leave him rather than live unscripturally. That made the man act, and now his wife is a publisher, planning to be baptized soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Overcoming problems is something that faces all of us at times. One of our special pioneer sisters was pregnant and the problem arose as to how she could put her time in the service. She decided to write to people who sent death notices to the newspapers. She had many replies, among them the following: “I am indeed grateful to you for your kind letter of condolence which you sent me in my recent bereavement. It is all the more heartening to find that even in these troubled times there are some who can forget their own cares and make time to console the sorrowful. Your message is a sermon indeed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in British Honduras carried on with great sincerity in their preaching activity during the 1964 service year. They show love for the people of that land and they have great joy in assisting them to learn the message of God’s kingdom. It takes persistence and a scheduling of their time and good planning to accomplish the purpose of preaching the good news to all people, but they had some remarkable results. Here are a few experiences to show their persistence in helping people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By thinking positively and planning accordingly many can become pioneers even from an early period in their theocratic careers. A recently baptized brother in one of our congregations planned that right after his baptism he would enter the vacation pioneer service with the view of becoming a regular pioneer. He has a family of six children and his wife is also a publisher. For a livelihood he runs a taxi service. This gives him unimaginable opportunities for witnessing to all kinds of persons. After three months of vacation pioneering he applied for an extension of three months. But before this period was up he requested a regular pioneer application form. Now he is a zealous pioneer holding a congregational position as literature servant. All this was accomplished in a little less than a year and a half! Pioneering can aid us to greater maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Love is listed first among the fruitage of the spirit, and a special pioneer sister relates how she demonstrated this fruitage in the Bible study work: “While doing door-to-door work in my territory one morning I was quite warmly received by a lady at her home. After delivering the sermon she accepted the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font4"> This opened the way for a back-call and a study resulted. Fine progress was at first made as the husband would himself listen in while relaxing in his hammock nearby. Suddenly one day the lady met me at the door stating, ‘I don’t think my study will continue much longer, for my husband is against it and has threatened to leave me.’ I told her I would talk to him on the matter. One morning I found him at home alone and thought this a fine opportunity to reason on the propriety of continuing the study. I requested his permission, but he refused, saying, ‘My wife knows just what I told her.’ Seeing that I was unable to get much out of him, I told him that I would call again, to which he replied, ‘I will look you up when I want to.’ However, because of the wife’s interest I did not get discouraged but followed the advice given at Matthew 10:16, being ‘cautious as a serpent.’ Arrangements were made to study while the husband was at work. I conducted the study sometimes for only fifteen or thirty minutes. This went on for some weeks until finally one day the lady decided to ask him some Bible questions. Since he professed to know the Bible, this was a good opportunity for him to teach his wife all about God’s Word. But this is when he found himself in real difficulty. He then realized that he knew nothing about the Bible and therefore needed a teacher. Can you imagine my joy when the wife informed me that she was sent to look me up so that the study might be resumed! Of course, the study was in progress all this while without his knowledge. Now it was not necessary to be ‘cautious as a serpent’ because he was sharing in the study himself! It was a great thrill to me to see them both attend our recently held district assembly.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A very excellent witness was given in the British Isles during the year. This can easily be ascertained by observing the number of hours the brothers and sisters spent in the field, namely, 7,814,147. This time was used to very good advantage too. Not only were those helped who had never heard anything about the truth, but real interest was shown on the part of the brothers to help some who had become inactive. During the year much fine work was done to help many of the 3,500 publishers who became inactive the previous year, and this with encouraging results. Many of the overseers and publishers had in mind, ‘above all things, to have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.’ (1 Pet. 4:8) The first experience reported from the British branch shows this intense love for one another. Experiences are also included from Aden, Gibraltar and Malta, territory cared for by the British office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother tells us: “I placed two magazines one Saturday with a man who did not seem to want to talk much. When taking him the next issues I met a sister who exclaimed: ‘Oh, that’s where Brother ---- lives.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She went on to tell me that at one time he had been a servant and a pioneer. I called on him alone to try to find out what his problem was, but he was not willing to talk much and kept saying that he had made his decision and that was that. I continued calling on him when I was in the area, but met a rather cool reception each time. But one Sunday morning he welcomed me warmly, invited me in and told me that, through my continually calling, even though he had tried to discourage me, he now felt that this was Jehovah giving him a last chance. He then told me his problems and, with the help of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> I was able to help him to sort out his life. We then started a Bible study with him and his wife, who is not in the truth; and his three children all attended. After many months of helping them we are now glad to say that his wife and children have become good publishers and the brother is now accounts servant in the congregation.” This experience is typical of scores more and shows what wonderful results can be obtained when we have unquenchable love for our brothers in their time of adversity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, it is very important to be able to recognise “sheep” when we meet them. It does not always follow that people who do not take literature are not interested, as the following experience shows. “On my first day in field service, I was accompanying a brother on sermon work, listening in the background. I felt there was some interest here and, since the brother making the presentation did not make a notation in order to call back, I decided to do so. On my calling again the next Sunday, the lady proved to be interested, so arrangements were made to continue our Bible discussion the following Thursday. As a result, a study has blossomed forth and this person is also attending the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">study and the public lecture each Sunday.” Wonderful results can be obtained if we are diligent to note every little sign of interest and cultivate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having found interested “sheep,” how tenaciously do we stick to them? This experience shows how important it is not to be put off too easily. “I first met Pauline eighteen months ago, and since she wouldn’t take the offer I left her two magazines and promised to return. Then followed about twelve months of frustrated back-calls. Sometimes I was sure she was avoiding me and I would say to myself, ‘I just won’t bother anymore with her.’ Each time I managed to find her at home I left current issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">and pointed out some article I felt might interest her. Once I succeeded in making a definite appointment with her for a back-call, but when I returned she was out. I decided to try different tactics and planned a surprise visit armed with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Look!’</span><span class="font4"> booklet to try to start a study. I remembered a suggestion in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font4">that we should say, ‘I </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">am</span><span class="font4"> glad to find you at home,’ so this is how I started. I was so happy when Pauline invited me in, and then I found out why I had made no progress so far. It seems that Pauline’s husband was getting annoyed. Each time he came home and saw the magazines he would say: ‘I see Mrs. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> has been here again. Why don’t you tell her straight out that you’re not interested? It’s only your money she’s after.’ Pauline told me she was trying to avoid me and, if she saw me at the end of the street, she would hurriedly get the children ready and go out. But when she opened the door and heard me say, ‘I </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">am</span><span class="font4"> glad to find you at home,’ she hadn’t the heart to turn me away and suddenly realised how important it must be for me to keep calling again and again. The happy ending to this call is that first Pauline and then her husband, Jack, began to study the Bible with us and now they are both regular publishers. We often laugh about the way Jack used to call me ‘Mrs. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!’</span><span class="font4"> Now he says, ‘I sure am glad you were an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> Mrs.’ ” What a grand reward for showing the Christian qualities of long-suffering, patience and endurance!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our elderly and indoor publishers continue to do fine work writing letters. A pioneer brother called at the home of a lady who told him that she had received a wonderful letter from one of Jehovah’s witnesses in a town far away. This letter from Sister A--- was</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">greatly appreciated because it gave her the utmost comfort at the time she lost her husband. Sister A----</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">regularly writes letters to bereaved persons and has received many grateful replies. Recently a man came over forty miles by car to see who it was who had sent him so comforting a letter at the time of his wife’s death. He is now in contact with the congregation in his own town. Although Sister A--- is eighty years</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of age, she regularly reports between twenty and thirty hours a month in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 22,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was a grand year of increase for the brothers in Aden, and for the first time an organized witness was given. The brother in charge of the work went through the Kingdom Ministry School in London last year and upon returning to Aden immediately began to put into operation the things he had been taught. As a result, house-to-house work was started for the first time in an organized way and good interest was found and much literature placed. It is especially pleasing to see what a wide distribution was given to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> Throughout the year the publishers averaged 19.1 magazines, and in June they distributed more than 30 magazines per publisher. The increase in Aden would have been greater but many of those studied with returned to England, where the studies have been continued. The small group have now covered their European territory twice and are working it the third time and finding much interest. As the year ends the problem looms up that the brother in charge of the work there is completing his contract of secular work and is finding it difficult to get other work and may have to leave Aden. We are very anxious to continue the fine work that has been done this year and there is a very fruitful field awaiting any brothers who can obtain secular work in Aden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GIBRALTAR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,004</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year has been one of steady increase in Gibraltar, and the brothers are very happy with the many blessings they have enjoyed. Much excellent work has been done teaching the young “sheep,” as is shown by the average of two Bible studies per publisher. The new ones have grown wonderfully in knowledge and maturity, resulting in a 46-percent increase in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the highlights of the year was their first circuit assembly. They overcame many difficulties and put in a tremendous amount of work to make this assembly successful. A hall could not be obtained due to religious prejudice so an old garage twenty feet square was rented. It was in a derelict state and they had to paint the floor, whitewash the walls and ceiling, build a platform and obtain materials for lights, cafeteria and other departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Visiting brothers came in from Tangier, Tetuan, and parts of Spain. Sisters were accommodated in homes, and all the brothers slept in the hall used for the assembly. The question was, How many would attend? They were surprised to see 65 in the small hall on Friday evening. On Saturday 75 squeezed in, but on Sunday they somehow had to find room for 85 who attended the public lecture. For the first time, 30 publishers were out on the streets offering the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 23,571</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many changes have taken place in Malta during the year and at the close of the year’s activity it is good to see the theocratic organization there in healthy condition. Malta welcomes retired persons with an adequate income and this has made it possible for two couples to leave Britain and live in Malta, and we hope more will be able to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just after the close of the service year Malta gained political independence. There is widespread unemployment in the island, which causes much distress. Most of the Maltese people are Catholics and the church has a powerful control. The Maltese generally are of a friendly nature, and the island has a fine climate. Under these conditions the brothers are finding the field service to be pleasant and fruitful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BURMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 20,054,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 243 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 82,527</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Burma gave the people of that land the greatest witness they have ever been able to give, by putting in 86,788 hours preaching the good news. This is a difficult land in which to preach because, in the first place, people do not believe in the Bible as the Word of God, for the majority of the population are Buddhists. Those who learn the truth are certainly sincere and want to learn more because it has brought them joy of heart. Here are a few experiences from the branch office in Rangoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I was really impressed by the great effort our brothers put forth to go out in the service and attend meetings in the villages where they do not have the facilities of modern transportation. One sister, a mother of five children, very poor materially, is particularly zealous. On the first day of the visit she left her home early in the morning to await my arrival. To get to the meetings this sister has to cross two streams that in the monsoon season become flooded. She brings her baby with her, and sometimes the water is so deep that when she crosses the streams she has to go on tiptoe, holding the baby high above the water. Such a trip requires real faith and trust in Jehovah because much of the homeward journey is made after dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as in Bible days, some who worship images forsake them to worship the true God, Jehovah. A Tamil special pioneer was assigned to work in a predominantly Tamil section across the Rangoon River. He was having good success and there was every hope of a congregation’s being established, but due to prevailing circumstances 75 percent of the population left for India. However, the pioneer has had joyful experiences. He writes: “While going from door to door I met an old couple. As soon as they knew that I was doing God’s work, they invited me in and listened intently to my sermon. I placed a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font4"> booklet with them and started a study on the initial call. The study con-tinned and in the course of witnessing to them I discovered that they were devout Hindus and regularly offered food to their images and sacred trees. Soon the truth regarding the true God and his requirements of worship reached their hearts, and they got rid of their images. Every time I would pass their house, I would see the man reading the Bible or the Society’s publications to his wife, who is illiterate. They accepted my invitation to attend the group </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study we have on this side of the river and later joined me in attending the meetings at the Kingdom Hall in Rangoon. The obligation to spread the Word of Life to others was explained to them, and they were happy to share in the service. How overjoyed I was to see these one-time worshipers of false gods stand up along with others at our recent circuit assembly in Rangoon and to hear them answer ‘Yes’ to the questions propounded at the baptism talk, and later to witness their immersion in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah! Yes, they had ceased worshiping gods of wood and stone for the worship of the true God, Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Illiteracy is no barrier to one’s becoming a publisher of the good news if the seed is sown on the right kind of soil. A missionary started a study with a mother of three children, using the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet at first and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book later. Although illiterate, the woman showed great love for God and was eager for knowledge. At first the publisher tried to teach her to read and write, but the woman had no time to spare for her homework as, in addition to keeping home for her husband and three children, she had to supplement her husband’s meager income by working as a water carrier for her neighbors in the evenings. The publisher therefore concentrated on teaching her the truth by word of mouth. She had a good memory and learned fast and repeated what she learned to her family and neighbors. Soon she joined in the house-to-house work, sometimes coming along with her youngest baby in her arms. She was baptized at our recent circuit assembly and continues to publish regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMEROUN REPUBLIC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,087,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7,344 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 557</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses experienced another year of rich blessing in this land. They were determined to follow the apostle’s advice: “At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” (Phil. 3:16) And our brothers have been making good progress over the years in Cameroun. But it is going to take diligent work on the part of the overseers to help all the publishers grow to maturity and gain greater knowledge of God’s Word. This the publishers are trying to do, and the experiences we have are very interesting. Also, a report is set out on Tchad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faithful women ministers are truly a blessing to the New World society. One such has made the most of the privileges open to her in the congregation. Sister M--- is fifty years of age and the mother of ten</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">children. By her perseverance and training, eight of these have also begun serving Jehovah. Her son is the congregation overseer, and now recently she has brought to her husband a knowledge of the truth. This zealous sister regularly spends over forty hours each month in the ministry, makes over twenty-five return visits on interested persons and also conducts four home Bible studies. Now she wants to enlarge her privileges further by engaging in the vacation pioneer ministry. Is it any wonder that the congregation reports that her zeal stimulates all the brothers and sisters to fine works?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer reports an experience that illustrates the power of the Bible to effect a change in a person’s life. In his daily witnessing he met a man who manifested great interest in his message. The man progressed very rapidly in knowledge and wished to accompany the minister in his service. There was a problem, however. For the past twenty-one years he had never eaten food prepared by his wife, because of an act of immorality on her part. Children were born and raised in this troubled atmosphere. Friends, relatives and even clergymen had tried to change this man’s attitude but without success. The Witness began to explain during several successive visits that Christians should forgive one another as Jesus instructed. Colossians chapter 3, verses 18 to 21, was discussed where the apostle Paul spoke about the relationship that should exist between husbands and wives and their children. The Witness also pointed out that a change in personality is necessary to conform to the Bible’s high standard. This man, favorably disposed toward the truth, began to reason to himself: ‘Well, I have wanted to preach love to others while I myself have not shown this quality.” Convinced, he decided to put an end to his unforgiving course and began to eat food prepared by his wife. He invited the pioneer minister and a neighbor to a meal where he proudly announced that his wife had prepared the meal. The wife, for her part, greatly rejoiced at this change of heart and has now decided to follow her husband’s example of Bible study. The husband now desires to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Picture in your mind a group of thirty-eight Africans around a log fire in front of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> thatched-roof house. The owner of the house sits proudly in front of the group and watches the fire consume his fetish instruments and objects of worship. This resulted from a brother’s visit to his native village where he stayed with this man and preached about worship of the true God, Jehovah. At first the man, sick and bedridden for three years, told the brother not to waste his time preaching to him. Gradually, after hearing the Witness preach to others in the home, he became interested and wished to have a study. Then he explained that he was a “wizard” and had contact with spirits and asked how he could get rid of their influence. The brother proved from the Scriptures that all these enslaving objects of false worship should be put away. The man got up from his bed and went about arranging to burn all his fetish materials. A neighboring congregation of twenty-five publishers was invited to witness the burning. This man and nine others in his compound are continuing their Bible studies and are another example of how the shackles of demon worship can be broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TCHAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 180,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Progress has been slow in preaching the good news of the Kingdom in Tchad due to the strong Moslem influence. The majority of the brothers there now are from other countries and during the year several of these returned to their native lands, leaving nine publishers to carry on the work. The zealous activity of these brothers resulted in a steady growth so that at the close of the service year their number had increased to fifteen publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit servant reports that, in spite of ten months’ having passed since the last visit, the high number of Bible studies being conducted and the regular attendance at meetings are a manifestation of their strong faith. There is a fine Kingdom Hall in Fort Lamy, the capital of Tchad, the only city where organized preaching activity has been carried on. Three interested persons have legalized their marriages and have thus conformed to the Bible’s high standard on marriage. Efforts have been made to help illiterate publishers learn to read, with good results, three having learned to read during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 18,730,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is truly interesting to observe the growth of a child, and equally interesting is the opportunity to observe the growth of a Christian, how he gains maturity, puts on a new personality and walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. The work of all of Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada and around the world is helping others to arrange their affairs in life to attain this growth and arrange time to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada had good success during the year in arousing the interest of the people of honest heart, because there were 1,916 persons baptized in water, indicating that they dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will. They want to change. The overall report on Canada is very good, and here are a few experiences that were sent in from the Canadian office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year an effort was made to reach the population living in the far north, Eskimos and Whites, many of the latter being a moving group engaged in mining, geological survey, and so forth. Most of this work was done in the Northwest Territories. Using lists of addresses we obtained, publishers wrote letters to these addresses, sending along a sample of each magazine and some subscription blanks. All together, 2,930 pieces of mail were sent. Some encouraging results were obtained. One Eskimo subscribed and said, in part: “I am glad to get a letter from you. I hope you continue to write me. You have opened my heart. I have always been a sinner . . . Now I want to turn away . . . and become a Christian so I can teach my own people in my language.” The caretaker of a mine some three hundred miles north of Yellowknife decided to spend his vacation in Toronto and look up the writer of the letter he received. He attended the meetings in the local congregation and was taken on a tour through Bethel. He now has a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> and other literature to assist him in learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another effort that was made was among the Indian reservations and villages in northern Manitoba. There are no places to stay there. The brothers had to take their own tents and food supplies. A brother who flies into that area was willing to provide transportation for some pioneers, so an arrangement was made with him and a schedule worked out to get three pairs of brothers into different villages and out again. In a few weeks they had placed 212 books, obtained 34 subscriptions, placed 1,205 magazines, made 228 back-calls and conducted 17 studies. The placements were quite good when one considers the limited number who can read English. At one village the people became so attached to the brothers that, when the plane came to take them away, the whole bank was lined with Indians to see them off!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Can a four-year-old child have a share in aiding others to become true worshipers? One child told his neighbor with whom he played that God’s name was Jehovah. The latter reported this to his parents for some confirmation. The parents did not want the child to enter religious discussions so they approached the mother of the four-year-old to ask that her son not speak about these matters when the children were playing. When the mother showed them the name of God at Psalm 83:18 in their own Bible, they were amazed and asked more questions. A study was started and now both mother and father are dedicated publishers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Women’s Auxiliary of an Anglican church started a Bible study in an effort to win back a member who was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. She had explained to them that she had never known anything about the Bible and that the Witnesses were the only ones willing to aid her. The first church lesson was on Hebrews 1:1-4. There was a question sheet provided and each one in the class was to give answers. When the class met, the answers that this lady gave, using </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font4"> as a basis, caused quite a stir. They discussed her answers, checked the scriptures she used, questioned the minister and forced him to admit that he had no answers and had not read the verses. He promised to write the bishop and ask him. The bishop advised that they not delve too deeply into things. ‘Trinity, the fable of creation and the myth of the birth of Christ are not meant to be scrutinized closely.’ Two Sunday-school teachers of the group were shocked to hear that from the bishop. They appealed to the lady to get answers from the Witnesses. The answers were shown to the minister and again he appealed to the bishop. The reply: “Close down that study or you are going to have to close down your church!” The lady continues to study with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">( i'.X IRAI. AFRICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,800,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The service year began with the opening of a branch office in Bangui, the capital city of Central Africa. This resulted in giving better attention to the organization in the country, and we have seen an overall improvement in theocratic activity in the land. The first class of the Kingdom Ministry School was organized and thirteen students were there, congregation servants, and on their return to the congregations undoubtedly more maturity will manifest itself. Here are some experiences of interest that were sent in by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One elderly sister enrolled in the literacy school gave the sermon “The Word of God Is Inspired” so well at a door that the man asked her where she became so learned. When she told him she had never even been to public school but that all she knew she had learned at the Kingdom Hall, the man said: “I have never seen an African woman of your age so well informed on the Bible. I’m astounded!” He took the latest magazines. On the return call he took two books, and now this sister who is just learning to read and write has begun a Bible study with this very literate man who shows interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Young publishers also can be very effective in the ministry. One such publisher carried his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book to school each day and during recess would explain the pictures to his playmates. As a result, one boy became very interested and, in spite of his Protestant father, is now a regular attendee at the Kingdom Hall. In another case, a sister, while in magazine work with her eightyear-old son, presented the magazines to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> man who stated emphatically that he was not interested. As they were leaving, the man said to the boy: “Why do you keep following your mother around all the time? You should be at home doing your homework.” The lad replied: “Because the Bible says that in the last days God would pour out his spirit on sons and daughters and they would serve him.” Surprised to hear a mere boy quoting the Bible, the man changed his mind and asked for the magazines. Next week he asked for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Bible and took two books. It may be that he also will be among those who receive God’s spirit and serve God in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The concentrated door-to-door activity during the circuit servant’s visit to one congregation was too much for the Baptist pastor. He, together with one of the local chiefs and the Moslem fakir, complained to the mayor that, if Jehovah’s witnesses did not confine their activity to the Kingdom Hall, there would be trouble. He even wrote a letter to the congregation servant to that effect. However, the brothers were not intimidated. Next day was Magazine Day, and the market, the street corners and the stores of the town were filled with Jehovah’s witnesses. To date no word has come from the pastor, but in the congregation that had 51 publishers, 59 reported that month and 241 attended the public meeting of the circuit servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Every once in a while troubles arise in a country and things stand still for a time, as far as gathering together the “other sheep” are concerned. Often there is a reason why no increase is forthcoming and it takes time to find out what the reason is. The experiences sent in by the Ceylon branch show that there was a very definite reason why the work stood still. We will let the branch tell the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that Jehovah is still interested in keeping his organization clean rather than have a large dirty one has been clearly evident in Ceylon during the past service year. Many persons have associated themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses here and have mixed in with them, and it was believed that they were sincere because of their association and their course of action. But some have come that Jehovah does not want. They have “slipped in” and, having gained the confidence of the brothers, began “turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct.” (Jude 4) Twelve of such were expelled from the congregation during the past service year. Such pruning and cleaning comes as a shock to some of the less mature, not fully appreciating that the great Cultivator, Jehovah, is the one doing this. However, in due course its beneficial effect becomes clearly manifest to all associating with the congregation, helping them to see the need to look to the organization rather than to individuals in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has strengthened the unity of the loyal ones with that perfect bond of unity, love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More and more the publishers are cultivating the pioneer spirit at heart. During the month of April, 24 percent of the publishers were enrolled as pioneers, twenty-one of these as vacation pioneers. A mother of six has vacation pioneered every year for the past six years, thereby giving the best possible encouragement to her children to make pioneering their career. The two elder children are already special pioneers. She writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Bringing up children in the authoritative advice of Jehovah has its rewards. Keeping close to his organization and obeying its instructions has brought me many blessings, especially the joy of watching my children grow up fearing and praising Jehovah more and more. The two elder ones who are special pioneers have a wholesome effect on the younger ones. In April this year I was happy to see three of my younger children vacation pioneer in earnest. Only the youngest, who is seven, was at home, though he too is an active, regular publisher. Aided by the zeal of the congregation overseer, who is a regular pioneer with a wife and two small children to support, as well as his loving encouragement and assistance, I was thankful to see the spirit of God move the children to spend their vacation wisely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One congregation had an experience that emphasizes the need to follow through on all expired subscription slips received. When the circuit servant visited this congregation during the subscription campaign, at the conclusion of his talk Tuesday evening he invited all present to make a thorough search for expiration slips in their possession and bring them to the meeting for field service the following morning. From these, many subscriptions were obtained. Four were from expiration slips sent to the congregation six years previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,300,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,404 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,438</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good progress has been made in the land of Chile during the past twelve months. Many persons have been aided in getting a good knowledge of the truth. There were 387 who were baptized, and the congregations were greatly refreshed by the district assemblies that were held in the country. Having in mind the psalmist’s prayer, “Let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God prove to be upon us, and the work of our hands do you firmly establish upon us,” they feel that this has been so. (Ps. 90:17) Jehovah’s pleasantness has been very manifest, and the branch office sends in some interesting experiences to prove this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this year we had the privilege of placing about 6,000 Spanish copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> in the hands of the people, and many fine experiences were enjoyed, typical of which is the following one sent in by the wife of a circuit servant. She offered the Bible to a young lady who expressed her desire to understand the Bible but did not think it possible for her. However, when shown the clear language of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> she realized that she could understand it and gladly tools: a copy. A study was demonstrated using the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News” </span><span class="font4">booklet, which study was continued the following Monday, when it was turned over to a publisher from the local congregation. Imagine the joy of the first sister four months later on her return visit to that congregation when she found the young person she started to study with attending all the congregational meetings. With genuine joy the student told her: “Truly there is nothing of greater value than learning these Bible truths. My determination is to continue to study and attend meetings with Jehovah’s witnesses.” Already she is sharing with others the good things learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How old should one be in order to feel Jehovah’s pleasantness upon him? Obviously there is no limit. A youngster three years of age, taught properly by dedicated parents, was able to direct an older person to the way to life. When a neighbor lady came to visit his mother, he met her at the door with the question, “Do you know anything about paradise?” Taken aback, she could not answer him right away, so he ran to bring her his well-worn copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book and began to explain to her all about Jehovah’s promised new order. Although previously atheistically inclined, she obtained a copy of the book and is now sharing regularly in a study about paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eighteen months ago a special pioneer couple was assigned to the island of Chiloe off the southern coast of Chile. It was the first time that a concentrated effort was made to spread the good news on the island. Due to Catholic prejudice and superstition they had many obstacles to overcome in order to carry on their missionary activity. However, it is very rewarding to see that already five persons have joined with them in the preaching work from house to house and a number of others meet with them regularly in their meetings. One day an elderly man came from one of the neighboring islands to their house with a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">in Spanish from 1962. He had received it by mail from a cousin in the southern province of Magellan, and he was looking for more magazines, since he had enjoyed it so much. After forty years as an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">evangelista</span><span class="font4"> he had become disillusioned and wanted to know the truth about the trinity, immortal soul, and so forth. His visit was a very profitable one for him and a very stimulating one for the pioneers. He left well satisfied and content, with increased knowledge, much Bible literature and a promise to keep in touch with him in the future. So the truth spreads among the islands of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COLOMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;16,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,407 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,696</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people in Colombia are certainly interested in the truth. At the close of the year 1959 they had reached a peak of 1,431 publishers. Five years later, as you see above, they have reached a peak of 3,407 publishers. What a marvelous increase in such a short time. This shows that Jehovah’s spirit is upon his servants in the earth, and they are enjoying wonderful experiences even though the pressures of the Catholic Church are great against Jehovah’s witnesses. God’s Word will always prevail even though it takes considerable time with some. Here are a few experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many times we wonder how much good a magazine can do, but read what </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> did for a young Adventist woman. One day when she was cleaning up the boss’s desk she found an old </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and, though she had been warned by her church not to read our literature, having a little time and a lot of curiosity, she read it. Time went by and she got </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on “ ‘The Word,’ Who Is He?” Jesus, not God? She tore it up! Later she obtained the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Word”</span><span class="font4"> booklet, but this time she read it calmly. The truth of Jesus’ identity came to her so clearly that she felt as if a veil had been lifted from her mind and now she wanted to talk with the Witnesses. When she was home alone one day a pioneer sister knocked at the door, answered some of her questions and arranged for a study. Soon the mother informed the pastor, and he and others frightened the girl with their lies about the Witnesses’ being false prophets. Out of contact with the Witnesses for two years she read the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font4">books and was sad because she could not believe her church doctrines anymore. Then a missionary sister began a study with her during the noon hour where she works until the mother learned enough to permit the study in their home again. Now both mother and daughter have stopped going to church. Both continue to study, the girl is a regular publisher, conducts studies of her own and places her goal of magazines monthly because she realizes the blessing she received from just </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Witnesses filled with God’s spirit take advantage of opportunities to give an incidental witness, sometimes with astonishing results. After establishing himself on a new farm, a man wanting to get acquainted with his neighbors found one family studying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book with Jehovah’s witnesses. They showed him the book and he wanted one but was told to return the following Friday at 3 p.m. to get one from a visiting minister. He did so, eagerly taking his book home, only to find that his family was irritated because he had obtained it. However, the Witness visited him in his own home and began a Bible study, and gradually every one of the family participated in it. Soon the man explained to the visiting Witness that he too was going to be a Witness, but he would not go out and preach, as he had ten children to take care of and did not have time. However, he said he wanted a Kingdom Hall in his home. Now, three years later, the man has changed his way of thinking. He has found out he </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">does</span><span class="font4"> have time to preach the good news. In fact, for over a year now he has been a regular pioneer. Additionally, he is now a congregation servant, his wife and three of his children are publishers and he has the congregation meetings in his own home! Yes, this family has received Jehovah’s blessings because they have in truth sought first the Kingdom and his righteousness. Incidental witnessing, followed up by a Bible study, produced a happy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO REPUBLIC (Brazzaville)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 962 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;840,000</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses during the past twelve months have witnessed in corners of the Congo never before reached. The publishers of God’s kingdom feel that this good news must go everywhere. Much interest has been aroused as a result of their efforts. Persons visiting the capital city of Brazzaville have learned of the truth and have gone back to their own villages and have spoken there of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus it is that most people, even though far from town, have heard of the Bible-teaching work that Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying on. These people, though, need great help in order to acquire accurate knowledge of God’s Word, and more ministers are required to serve this kind of territory. As the publishers increase in number in the cities more will be moving out to spread the Word of God. The branch office in Brazzaville looks after the Congo Republic and also the Republic of Gabon, and here are some experiences from each place.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Never should we neglect opportunities to witness in the busy marketplaces. While working a large African market, stall by stall, a missionary was approached by a man whose curiosity led him to accept the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font4">book after a brief discussion. His curiosity turned to genuine interest. He obtained other publications, including a Bible, and agreed to a study in his home. The study was conducted in French, but so that his wife might profit from the good things he was learning, he patiently translated the message into the local dialect. At the close of the first study he asked: “Where do you people meet?” The following Sunday he attended the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study at the Kingdom Hall, and the second week brought his wife along with him. Both made fine progress, to the point of desiring to share these newly learned truths with others. However, it came to light that this interested man was legally married to two wives. Proving that he appreciated Scriptural principles, he took rapid steps to put his marital affairs in order, and soon was able to begin in field service. A month later his wife joined him in the ministry, and recently both were baptized at a district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An African Congolese brother, working in a laboratory with Europeans and Africans, took the opportunity to share the Kingdom hope with a young French girl, leaving with her a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Though Catholic, her interest in God’s Word was manifest from the beginning. She obtained her first copy of the Bible from this brother. Soon she was having a Bible study to get an understanding of what she was reading. Her parents, on learning that she was studying the Bible with an African Witness, came to see him, manifesting hostility to him and the message and requesting that the study be stopped. Nevertheless, the study continued, and little time passed by before the parents saw what an excellent change had taken place in their daughter’s conduct and way of life, because of her diligent study and application of Bible principles. Their attitude became more tolerant. This young interested person progressed swiftly in knowledge and appreciation of the truth. She obtained all the publications available and started to attend the meetings regularly in an all-African unit. Soon she was engaging in field service in company with the local African brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only eight months after having heard the truth for the first time she symbolized her dedication at a recent district assembly. What encouragement her regularity in service and meeting attendance is to others! And how thankful she is that her African brother had the love and courage to speak to her even though she was European!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;450,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 77 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,844</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A small group of publishers, despite numerous difficulties, made the voyage from their port city to another city in the neighboring country to attend their very first assembly. It proved to be an unforgettable experience for them all, so much so, in fact, that on the return trip their joy moved them to witness to everyone on board their small ship. Many heard the truth for the first time, and a good number of publications were placed. One man especially manifested keen interest, but was lost to view in the bustle that followed arrival at port. Imagine the joy of the publisher to find this very same person some time later in his own personal territory! A study was started immediately, and this young man has advanced steadily, now attending congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the Gabonese government officially recognized the local association used by Jehovah’s witnesses. Encouraged by this legal recognition, the brothers are openly announcing their hope with increasing zeal, and all look forward to many blessings during the coming service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO (Leopoldville) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 14,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,167 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,421</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everyone acquainted with conditions in Africa knows of the difficulties that this country has gone through. However, Jehovah’s witnesses have been busy with their work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom even during all these uncertain times. While rebellion has been rife throughout most of the country and many have lost property as well as lives, still the good news of the Kingdom must be preached. The general trend of the people’s attitude is that everyone must belong to some political party. When Jehovah’s witnesses explain that they are just for God’s kingdom and are interested in preaching the Bible only they often become the target of persecution. A constitution has now been adopted by the people of the Congo and it guarantees freedom of worship and does not allow for any State church. It is hoped that through this guarantee of freedom of worship it will be possible for Jehovah’s witnesses to have greater liberty in many areas where they have met with great opposition. Some of the experiences sent in from the branch are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world are recognized by their good conduct and behavior is well indicated by the following experience: While visiting an isolated group of three publishers, the circuit servant was told about the chief of fruit agriculture in the village. The three publishers are employees of the chief, and when it was indicated that the chief was very interested in the magazines, a visit was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why was the chief so interested in the magazines? The chief explained how honest the three publishers who work under his direction are, their conduct being above reproach. He said that the Witnesses practice what they preach, not only in their Kingdom Halls, but outside. This, he said, is proof that the Witnesses are worshipers of the true God. He also mentioned that previously he had worked with Witnesses, and not once did they speak evil of their fellow workers or disobey the ones in responsible positions. He admitted that, if all people were like the Witnesses, perhaps the earth would be a planet of peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the need is great in the Congo cannot be denied. One circuit servant relates the following: “One Sunday morning as we were considering the text and some service points before going out into the field, I saw two persons approaching our gathering. These two men had traveled a distance of sixty kilometers. They shared in the ministry with us during the morning, then attended the public meeting. Later that day as I made preparations to leave for the next group, the two men insisted that I visit them in their village to help them. They even found a bicycle for me and made me come along. Seeing their great interest, I went with them. As we traveled the sixty kilometers, we had the opportunity to witness to many people. In one village composed of thirty houses, all the adults and children came to the house of the chief to listen to the truth. In another village of sixty people, where we stopped for a drink of water, all turned out to drink some spiritual truths in exchange. Upon arriving in the village of the two interested men, to my surprise and joy I found that they had a Kingdom Hall. In all, they were four in number and had a real appreciation of the truth. I was able to work with them in the field and many more showed genuine signs of interest. I did all I possibly could to show them how to carry on the work, how to study with the people and help them gain a deeper knowledge of the truth. On leaving I knew that I had not been able to do very much in the short time, and this brought to mind the words of Jesus in Matthew 9: 36-38, which say that “the harvest is great, but the workers are few.” So, brothers, as you can see, in this large country of ours many interested people are waiting for someone to come and help them. Who will answer the call to serve where the need is really great?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,333,432</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,768 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 482</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the great volcano near San Jose belching out ashes and smoke over a large population, many religious people believe that God is punishing the people of Costa Rica for their wickedness. Of course, this gives Jehovah’s witnesses a marvelous opportunity to explain to the people of the country the meaning of the Bible prophecies regarding the last days and how God’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind. At the same time, these ashes inconvenience everyone, even Jehovah’s witnesses. Troubles come one way or another in this system of things, and the servants of Jehovah God must be persistent in preaching the good news. There have been other difficulties, too, in Costa Rica. There were quite a number who allowed their love for truth and upright living to wane and they have been disfellowshiped. But, despite these problems, the work continues and, even though there was no great increase, still the Word of Jehovah is sounded out. Here are a few experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our yeartext emphasized preaching with boldness. Sometimes, when trouble cannot be avoided, our boldness may overcome our persecutors. In one instance it stopped a mob. In Costa Rica there are some extremely fanatical Catholics in many places, and our brothers have to guard against violence, usually leaving when signs of violence appear. In one city our brothers have been mobbed many times in the past years. Three pioneers were working there when the head police official of the city approached one and, without asking, picked up his literature case and began to search it. This seemed to arouse the people standing nearby and a mob began to form. Although the police officer left without comment, the people were excited and started calling out threats against the brothers. It was not possible for the brothers to leave quietly, and to run away would have invited an attack upon them. Instead, they went up to some in the group and asked where they could find the police officer who had searched the brother’s case, as they wanted to discuss it with him. The mob was confused at this and some told them how to get to the police station, and they were allowed to go. The police officer at first refused to speak with the brothers and demanded that they obtain permission from the Catholic bishop and the governor before they continued preaching. The brothers showed determination to speak with him and explained that they would continue their work, obeying God rather than men. Finally, with the Scriptures, they were able to calm him and explain their work. At the end of this interview this head official not only was friendly but took the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> in Spanish and the special April 15 issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> commenting: “Now I will be able to answer anyone that comes here with foolish objections.” In this instance preaching the Word with boldness dispersed a mob and opened the way for a witness to the police authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year we had one serious case concerning blood transfusion, but a flrm stand resulted in a good witness and caused some to recognize the difference between false religion and the true. One sister refused a transfusion when being treated for pernicious anemia and complications arising from her pregnancy. No doctor would treat her without blood, and finally she had to leave the hospital. Although she lives in a divided household and has many opposed relatives, she refused to compromise. The brothers and her close relatives who are in the truth cared for her and helped her to build her strength as best they could at home. Reaction among the people in the city was very bitter, and much adverse publicity resulted, giving the brothers many opportunities to witness for the truth. The opposers to the truth circulated a rumor that the sister had died and even gave out the time of her burial, and the radio station took it upon itself to announce that the sister had died. Finally, one doctor was persuaded to come to the home, and he agreed to treat the sister. He helped her to build up her blood to the point where she could undergo a minor operation that was necessary immediately. No blood was used and no problems arose during the operation, and now the sister is out of danger and is active in the field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba have been diligent in preaching the “everlasting good news” during this service year. Despite many problems that have confronted them in the work, they have gone ahead courageously, and Jehovah’s blessing has been with them. They have taken the same stand as the apostles before them, as set out in the fourth chapter of Acts, and have prayed: Jehovah, “grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.”—Acts 4:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been much governmental pressure to discourage their ministerial activities. Many Kingdom Halls were closed, and some servants were arrested on charges of not registering separate local associations. In some cases, after representations were made to the provincial officials, instructions were given that the Kingdom Halls could again be opened. However, orders have also been given to prosecute all persons doing a proselyting work. On discussing the matter with high police officials, it was explained that Christians have a commission to preach the Word and that it is in the interests of the government to have this work carried on, as it helps to maintain the public order in helping the people to be law-abiding citizens through Bible instruction. However, as Christians Jehovah’s witnesses are commissioned to preach and cannot stop, even though put in jails or labor camps, since this commission is from God and each Witness is responsible to God for his acts. The Witnesses do not speak against the government or to groups on streets, but continue quietly speaking about the Kingdom hope to interested persons wherever they may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During November there were about five trials every week, but most of the Witnesses were acquitted and in only a few cases were fines imposed. In one province all the halls were closed, but the brothers were able to increase their activity despite this. The work has been under severe opposition, with constant surveillance by the block committees and many arrests; but the answer has been more activity in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many applied for vacation pioneer service so that in April there were 817 on the list. One congregation of fifty-four publishers had thirty send in applications for vacation pioneer service, and one became a regular pioneer. This shows the courage and boldness of the brothers and that they are determined to push ahead with the preaching of the everlasting good news of the Kingdom and to help mourning ones get out of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although it was not possible to send any literature into the country, some booklets were made available for the brothers locally. For the most part, the brothers just use the Bible in witnessing, as literature is not available for placing in any quantity. In June the report showed a 15-percent increase in publishers over the previous June and a 25-percent increase in hours, and in back-calls the increase during the year was almost 50 percent. Bible studies went from 18,000 to 25,000 during the year. Although one report told of six congregation servants’ being prosecuted for refusing to stop their ministry in accord with the instructions of Matthew 24:14 so that four of them were jailed for three months and the others for two months, still the brothers continue to increase their activity each month. The August report showed the fifth peak in publishers in the year and the tenth in a row in home Bible studies. Surely Jehovah’s hand is not shortened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 531 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,130</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From reading the newspapers one would wonder how anyone could carry on the ministerial work in Cyprus in these days with all the shooting and difficulty between the Greeks and Turks and the different armies in there representing the United Nations. Still, in Cyprus Jehovah’s witnesses have pressed on preaching the good news of the Kingdom. They have not had any increase in publishers. In fact, there was a 6-percent decrease because quite a few publishers saw fit to leave the island on account of the terrible political situation. They felt it was best to be living somewhere else. Despite this, there were twenty who were immersed during the year, much to the joy of the brothers, who did not stop preaching the good news. It was wonderful to see that more hours were devoted to preaching the Kingdom message this year than during any other year, despite all the turmoil and fighting. Here are a few experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keeping Kingdom interests first while living in this troubled world has been emphasized to the brothers here. Many have responded to the call to vacation pioneer, which has helped in giving a greater witness than ever before in the island’s history. A young school lad took up the invitation to vacation pioneer during the school holidays in the summer. All was set and planned in a schedule, as recommended for all publishers. Then news came through that the school had changed the vacation period to another time. What did the young lad do? He adjusted his schedule and went right ahead and vacation pioneered with other members of his family while still going to school. As the schools here in Cyprus have an early start with their lessons and close school at one o’clock in the afternoon, it allowed the young lad to make his way home immediately after school was over, sit down and do his homework, then go out into the pioneer service for the rest of the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A congregation in the west of the island kept physically and spiritually strong as they put Kingdom interests first. It usually takes them three hours or more to walk the seven to nine miles to their neighboring villages. There are not the roads in this area for a quick trip in a motorcar, as in other parts of the island. They spend more time going and coming from their house-to-house activity than in actual witnessing. Yet they average over ten hours per publisher each month as a congregation. What is the key to this success? A solid weekly schedule and family cooperation. The circuit servant was very pleased to tell us that in the east of the island one of the brothers whom he helped to make up a schedule for service increased his hours from six to seventeen each month and increased from one back-call each month to live. Again the key to success was regular weekly service no matter what else might present itself in this busy, troubled world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,665,800</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Like any other country, Denmark has its problems. One concerns a court case on the right to distribute Bibles and Bible literature from house to house evenings and Sundays. This case is still before the court. Some Danish church leaders promoted a moving picture that was supposed to expose Jehovah’s witnesses, but it does not appear that many people are interested in going to see it. Preaching hate on the part of the clergy is not the way to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The publishers of the Kingdom are ignoring the outside pressures and are going right ahead zealously preaching the good news from house to house. And they had fair success during the past year. In fact, the greatest witness ever given in the land was accomplished in Denmark as far as hours spent in the ministry are concerned. The branch office in Denmark gets reports on field activity from the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and experiences from these places are also included herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Denmark Jehovah’s witnesses must especially become skilled in the art of directing the oft-heard and almost trivial objection, “I am </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> interested,” into a discussion of Bible promises. One sister who was fairly new as a publisher mastered this art well. She contacted a lady who rejected her visit with a very definite, unmistakable “I am </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> interested!” But by being very friendly the sister managed to exchange a few comments and placed two magazines with the woman, who still insisted she had no real interest. In the course of several visits such interest was aroused that the sister had to call very often to keep this lady supplied with reading material. When the sister attended the district assembly she left two bound volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and a book to meet her needs until she would return. But it was not enough. Before she returned this lady had visited the congregation servant to get additional information, and soon a study was started. Within a few weeks she became a regular, eager participant at meetings. Her husband, who previously was also “not interested,” started to read the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book one evening and became so interested that he nearly finished the book at one sitting. Now both of these persons have begun to accompany publishers from house to house. All this change of attitude took place within about four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While there is a great need for more workers in the harvest, there is also a need for those who work to increase their hours. A good time schedule is a help. One elderly sister who lives about nineteen miles from the Kingdom Hall was surprised to learn this. Her husband is not in the truth, her health is not good and a small income adds to the difficulties. In spite of all this, she has been a regular publisher for several years. One of the sisters was encouraging her to strive for the ten-hour goal, but she felt she was unable to do more. In talking about the matter it came to light that the sister did not have a schedule. Together they worked out a schedule providing for the sister to make use of her weekly trip to the market. It was arranged for her to take one route walking to the store and another route on the way home. On the way to and from the store she covered portions of a territory, made back-calls and started a magazine route. For several months now this elderly sister has had an average of eleven hours and six back-calls, and she places nearly twelve magazines monthly. How about her health these days? “I never have a day when I feel better than those days I spend in Jehovah’s service,” replies this seventy-year-oid sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAROE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,596</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Perseverance and patience are the qualities needed to get results up here. Interested persons need help for a long period of time. One publisher tells that he had delivered magazines to a lady for a long period of time without developing any further interest. Then an article in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on infant baptism caused her to ask questions, and a Bible study was started. But for some time it was the publisher who asked the questions, answered them and read the scriptures and the paragraphs. It look a longer time, with tact and effort, to get this interested person to see how she could put on her glasses and follow along in the paragraphs, and eventually learn to prepare for the study by underlining main points. Though it took time, progress was made, and this lady began to attend meetings when a sister would come for her and accompany her to the meetings and home again. With patience she was helped step by step to dedication, baptism and regular participation in service, and now a study has been started with some of her relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses always put forth an effort to preach the truth in such a way as to strengthen and unite the family tie if possible, giving all in a family an opportunity to accept the truth. Two special pioneers followed the Society’s suggestion on this and got good results. They started a study with a man who showed much interest in the truth, but his wife demonstrated her lack of interest by starting to go to church when the study was held, something she generally had not done before. The two publishers put forth a real effort to get her to participate in the study, and little by little they succeeded in establishing a friendly relationship with her. This couple has since attended the two small assemblies up here and had their children along. Now, together, they are being helped to get a better understanding of God’s Word. The man has accompanied others in the preaching work and has now offered the pioneers the privilege of inviting others to the study in his home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The two congregations received visits of a traveling overseer during the year and, in addition to receiving much good counsel, the brothers had the joy of seeing 590 persons attend showings of the new film. For the last month of the service year this brought the attendance at film showings up to 1,134.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase in publishers is due to brothers’ moving from Denmark to Greenland to serve where the need is great. These brothers have got established with living quarters and secular work and are doing a good job in publishing while at the same time learning the difficult Greenlandic language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each winter a night school is conducted by the community for Danes who wish to learn Greenlandic. Every year many start the course but soon quit, so that by the end of December the course has stopped. This year ten newly arrived Witnesses signed up in one town and, although in the beginning there were many in the course, by the time the Christmas holidays were over there were only ten left in the school—yes, the ten Witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The people of the Dominican Republic are hungry for the truth. For years they went through many trials and difficulties, but with Jehovah’s witnesses now having free course to preach and go into all parts of the land there are many hearing ears. This island with an average of only 1,309 publishers had 4,064 at the Memorial celebration. The brothers there appreciate the arrangement for vacation pioneering too. It gives the brothers and sisters an opportunity to gain experience in this field. It is interesting to note that the average number of studies per congregation publisher is one, per pioneer is six, and per special pioneer is 11.5. Here are a few joyful experiences that were sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service year got off to a wonderful start. For four days during the second month of the service year, October 3-6, the brothers enjoyed themselves in a national assembly in the northern part of the country, with the vice-president of the Society, F. W. Franz, giving the principal talks. Then just six days later, on October 12, the new branch building was dedicated, and again the brothers were privileged to have the vice-president with them to give the dedication talk. This new building is certainly serving as a great witness. The large sign above the Kingdom Hall doors seems to draw the attention of just about everyone passing by, and many comments are heard. Some are favorable and some are not so favorable, but one thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is certain: the building testifies to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are here and that they intend to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although pioneers are sometimes heard to say that they have all the studies that they can possibly attend to, back-call slips are not overlooked and are usually turned over to the pioneers to call on. One such slip was sent from Brooklyn and was forwarded to a special pioneer working in the town where this person lived. When called on, this interested doctor showed exceptional interest. They talked for three hours on different subjects, and the doctor showed quite a knowledge of the Bible due to reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower in </span><span class="font4">Spanish. A study was started, both subscriptions were obtained and eleven books were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Memorial attendance this year was outstanding. About 75 percent of those attending were interested persons and only about 25 percent were publishers. Almost every Kingdom Hall was filled to overflowing, with people sitting or standing outside. One brother who was on a trip to New York tried to get back in time for the Memorial, but, seeing that he could not make it in time, bought wine and bread in New York, gave the talk on the plane and offered the wine and bread to the brothers traveling with him just as though they were in a Kingdom Hall. All of this happened in a severe storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ECUADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,715,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Ecuador have had a very busy but happy time during the 1964 service year. Along with their brothers throughout the world they have paid special attention to the distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. They have increased the distribution in the country by about 37,000. Here are some interesting experiences on the magazine work in Ecuador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer placed two magazines with a person who told him frankly that he was taking the publications only for courtesy and not because he liked Jehovah’s witnesses. He said he would never change from the Catholic religion. When the pioneer tried to arrange for a return visit, the man told him he would be welcome as a friend but not to talk about religion. After a few calls, however, both found it was impossible to be friends without talking about religion. In time the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet was placed and a study proposed. At that time a session of the ecumenical council in Rome was about to begin and the unification of faiths was on the agenda. Using this as an excuse, the person said he preferred to wait until the end of the council and then decide whether he wanted to study. The pioneer suggested that a wiser course would be to have his study while the council was on so that he could make a wise decision when the time came. The study was started. On the sixth week this person announced that lie did not have to wait until the end of the ecumenical council to make up his mind, as it was already made up—he had decided to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The study continued on into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font4"> and soon the person was a baptized publisher. This made his brother begin to investigate and before long he also was baptized. Six members of the family attended this year’s district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet another experience shows the impact of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and the value of persistence in making back-calls. To appreciate this we have to go back seven years to when a double subscription was obtained from a lady who assured the pioneer that she ‘did not want to read anything against the Catholic religion.’ In spite of persistent calling back the pioneer was unable to see the lady again, speaking only with the maid. Finally she decided that the subscriber did not want to see her again. The subscriptions ran out and a back-call was made to suggest renewal. The lady herself this time greeted the pioneer with open arms. It turned out that she had spent almost the entire year in bed due to a critical condition. This had given her time to read every magazine from cover to cover. Now she welcomed a Bible study, although, for a time, this had to be carried on in spite of her husband’s opposition. Attendance of relatives at the study grew rapidly, resulting in five baptized Kingdom publishers. Now, during the 1964 service year, two of this sister’s daughters have been baptized and shared in vacation pioneer work with their mother. Another daughter and a fleshly sister are also candidates for baptism at the next assembly, while her husband has now become a friendly listener.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,814,703</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark163"></a>To be one of Jehovah’s witnesses anywhere in the world requires courage, but to be one in Eire takes a double measure of courage. However, our brothers in Eire have been “filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness.” As far as time spent in preaching is concerned, the special pioneers are the ones who are giving the great witness in Eire. Of the 154,000 hours spent in preaching, the special pioneers devoted five-sixths of this time steadily, peacefully and courageously moving ahead with the preaching work. Herewith are a few experiences from the country.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Tracts have been an extremely valuable asset to the work in Eire, because many Catholic people who fear to take our books or magazines will often accept a tract. The use of tracts can be most rewarding, as a missionary sister found when making a return visit to a Catholic lady to whom she had given the tract “Life in God’s New Order.” This lady had many questions and wanted a copy of the Bible, so the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> was placed. After several return visits a study was started, and eventually the lady, her husband and seven children were all studying. As they gained knowledge of Bible principles, problems began to arise. The children were going to a Catholic school and one of the girls was due to be confirmed. The parents appealed to the school authorities to exempt their daughter from religious exercises, but they were uncooperative and made the girl the object of ridicule day after day. The children were then moved to a Protestant school and the difficulties disappeared. The whole family appreciate the meetings, and the children have handled assignments in the ministry school extremely well. They follow the Ministry School Schedule of Bible reading in the home, with noted improvement in the peace and unity in the family circle. Four of the family are now publishers of the good news. What a rich fruitage from one small tract!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The benefits of enrollment and participation in the ministry school are underlined by the following experience related by a sister: “Since I began appreciating the truth some four years ago, once every year during Lent a priest would call on me to try to persuade me to return to the Catholic Church. However, this year it was a little different. The priest who called accepted the fact that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and he did not attempt to change me. After entertaining a few of his questions, he surprised me by asking the very question that I had to answer in a student talk assignment in the theocratic ministry school the week before! That question was: ‘What proof have you that the Bible is inspired? After all, could we not say the same thing about any other book?’ How glad I was for the provision of the theocratic ministry school, for I was well prepared to answer him on this question! I used the same material that I gave in my student talk assignment. After further discussion one of the children started to cry; he used this as an excuse to leave. After he left, I thanked Jehovah for his wonderful gift of the truth revealed through his inspired Word, the Bible, and also for his wonderful provision of the theocratic ministry school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EL SALVADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,757,011</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 847 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,255</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While El Salvador may be the smallest country of Central America, it certainly has a good-sized population, and many people there are interested in the message of God’s kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses in El Salvador have shown real courage and have reached out to the ends of their territory with the good news of God’s kingdom. The truth has been received enthusiastically by many people, and during the year there were seventy-one who were baptized—people who fled from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. These have established themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses and they are preaching together with others in El Salvador. Here are a few experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant sends in this experience: “After serving four years of a nine-year sentence for murder, a man received the message of truth from a special pioneer sister. At first the man took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font4"> and within a short time a study was started. The study was held regularly each week, and as he began to take in these life-giving truths he began to talk to his fellow prisoners. Soon many were sitting in on the study. In time a great change was noted in this person as he let these new-found truths make his mind over. Now he had a new hope for the future. Each time I would visit the pioneers in this town, I would make it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> point to visit this man in prison. After several visits he expressed his desire to be baptized. Arrangements were made with the director of the prison to allow them to go to a nearby pool, where he symbolized his dedication. The baptism talk was given at the pool, where twelve persons, which included two guards, listened intently. Now we have a new brother who is very active in his confined territory preaching to the other prisoners the truth that can set men free, while he serves out the rest of his sentence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Endurance and courage go hand in hand as can be seen by this experience: “While working from house to house I came across a family that refused to hear the message, all except a young man who asked many questions about our beliefs. The more we talked the more interested he became. I went back the following week and started a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">’Good News’</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and arrangements were made to return the following week to continue the study. On my returning he told me that he was receiving strong opposition from his mother and father, even to the point of being threatened with punishment. His common-law wife threatened to leave him if he did not stop studying. His in-laws threatened to throw Jehovah’s witnesses out physically if they ever came back again. The man showed courage by not stopping the study but continuing it at his place of work. Since he is a forest ranger, the place of study was on the side of a hill. The study progressed very well for several weeks until one of his neighbors who also opposed the work of Jehovah’s witnesses went to the National Guard headquarters and falsely made a charge that we were secretly studying communistic literature, which is against the law. The next time we had our study the National guardsmen were waiting and at rifle point our literature was confiscated and we were led to police headquarters, where the one in charge began going through my book bag. When he came across the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book he exclaimed with admiration, ‘What a lovely book!’ He became so interested in the book that he forgot that he was questioning me, and he asked, ‘How much is this book?’ After seeing that the literature did not contain communistic teachings, he showed much interest in our work; and he also asked that we please forgive him and his men for the inconvenience that he had caused us.” What has been the result of this publisher’s endurance and courage? The man is continuing his study along with his common-law wife, who had before been opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;441,301</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 261 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,691</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This branch in the South Pacific looks after a vast territory, because Jehovah’s witnesses are working on many islands. Some new congregations have been organized, some work has been started on islands never witnessed to before, and generally there has been a good increase. One good report shows that the Europeans who have gone to these islands have trained the local brothers to assume responsibilities in looking after congregations. Now in many places the Polynesian brothers are taking the lead as overseers. This is very gratifying. The report from the branch office in Fiji covers experiences from American Samoa, the Cook Islands, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Niue Island, Tahiti and Tonga, as well as Western Samoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clearly demonstrating the need for all in a home to be invited and encouraged to share in the study that is held there, is the following experience of a special pioneer sister. A study was started with an elderly man whose wife at first did not show any interest. However, she was curious to know what was being discussed, and at times would sit beside the door of the room in which the study was held to listen in for brief periods. The special pioneer used these brief opportunities to direct some of her remarks to the lady, and tactfully drew her gradually into the study. After a time she and a close friend of hers whom she invited to join in the study, as well as her husband, all began attending congregation meetings; and as soon as they had overcome their fear of what their neighbors would say, they started out in the preaching work. At a recent circuit assembly both she and her husband were baptized, and their close friend is also waiting to be baptized at the first opportunity. All this took place because a sister encouraged as many in the home as possible to join in the home Bible study held there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What do you say when presenting the New World Translation Bible at the doors and the householder tells you that he already has a Bible? A circuit servant’s wife has successfully overcome this by asking those who say this to let her see their Bible. In some cases they brought out the Society’s books, once a bundle of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazines, another time the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Babylon” </span><span class="font4">book, and so on. After showing them that these are Bible-study aids and not the Bible itself, and how the Bible is necessary in order to benefit from them fully, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> was often placed. In this way eighteen Bibles were placed in one month in the house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,864</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 32 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 683</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the service year, during the combined visit of the district servant and circuit servant, a change in the congregation meeting place was recommended. This suggestion was followed, with the result that the meetings are now held in a much better atmosphere and attendances have increased greatly. This has given the brothers an incentive to improve their meeting place even further, and they are looking forward to starting work on building their own Kingdom Hall in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As was suggested at a recent circuit assembly, a strong effort was put forward to encourage all in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">home to share in a home Bible study. This has certainly borne fruit in family unity of husbands, wives and children. It has also resulted in increased meeting attendance and contributed to the publisher increase. During the year members of eight such families have contributed to increased meeting attendances and field activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three circuit visits during the year did much to keep the publishers progress-minded and on the move, and the two circuit assemblies also proved to be great stimulants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COOK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,720</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,872</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the fact that the false religious organizations exercise a strong grip on the islands’ inhabitants, it has not been easy for the publishers to make the break from Babylon the Great. However, publishers have remained firm in the face of opposition by their own family members and relatives and the community. Furthermore, the Legislative Assembly recently framed mischief by law with a view to restricting the proclamation of the Kingdom message. This can be seen in the following motion that was presented and passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Cook Islands: “That the Resident Commissioner with the support of the Executive Committee should exercise his discretion in refusing permits for entry to the Cook Islands by missionaries of religious sects not universally recognized and foreign to these islands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These assemblymen even allowed their religious sentiments to prevail over their better judgment, as was evidenced further at the time of the proposed visit of the circuit servant to the island in the middle of the service year. When it was known that he and his wife were Jehovah’s witnesses, an entry permit for him to enter the islands was refused on purely religious grounds. However, fearing the possibility that the circuit servant might have obtained a visa from the authorities in Western Samoa, the local leaders sent a special delegation to the airport to meet the circuit servant and inform him that it was necessary for him to return to Western Samoa on the return flight of the aircraft on which he had just arrived! However, since the circuit servant did not arrive, the assembly delegation waited at the airport in vain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of the service year the brother serving where the need is great at Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands had to return to New Zealand with his wife, as his work contract there had expired and had not been renewed. On the brother’s way to New Zealand he went via Ocean Island, where he was able to meet an Australian brother who is on a work contract there for only six months. Some of the interested people on Ocean Island with whom the brother from the Gilbert Islands had been corresponding were introduced to the brother temporarily working there, and he is now conducting studies with these persons regularly. One of them has asked to be baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A good start to the service year was the return of twenty-nine enthusiastic brothers from the Suva, Fiji, “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. Newspaper reporters interviewed the brothers on arrival, and a journalist also interviewed the brothers at the Kingdom Hall, leading to publication of a newspaper article about the work, as well as an article in an illustrated magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Brothers, if you are going to build a Kingdom Hall, be sure to build a big one,” is the advice of the overseer of the local congregation. This remark is based on experience, for the congregation has had to make extensions to their Kingdom Hall twice during the past service year in order to keep pace with the congregation’s increase. Presently, the hall will accommodate 180 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this island there are many people of all races and religions, including Muslims. A pioneer sister contacted a Muslim lady who said that she could not listen to the sermon because she was a member of a different religion; whereupon the sister tactfully replied that the Bible was the written Word of the Almighty God, and asked the lady if she believed in many gods, or just the one true God. The woman answered that she believed in only the one God. The sister then said: “If there is only one God, then your God is also my God, and therefore His book is also for you and for me.” The lady listened to the sermon, accepted literature, and on the return visit a study was started. The lady made good progress even in the face of opposition from her family members. She even convinced her consensual marriage partner to have their marriage legalized, and at the next circuit assembly she was baptized. She is now, in turn, conducting a Bible study with an Indonesian, and showing her too how the Book of the one true God is for men of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60,374</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At the start of the service year </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a group</span><span class="font4"> study was organized in town using the “Good </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font4"> The study has been conducted in very simple English and also in Pidgin-English. There has been a steady attendance of fifteen persons at this meeting and as many as twenty persons have been attending talks. Many from other islands come once or twice when they are in town, and then when they return home they spread the word about the “missionaries who teach the Bible without passing the plate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The seven brothers serving where the need is great and the three new local brothers who have started in the service are glad that they are now having an increasing share in the service, and would welcome any who would be willing to travel to New Hebrides to give badly needed assistance in getting the Kingdom message preached there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NIUE ISLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,993</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Two brothers from this territory were able to attend the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly at Suva in Fiji, and they returned to tell the brothers at home of the many wonderful things seen and heard at the assembly and of the joyful association they had shared with the brothers from all over the world. Evidently the brothers on the island were impressed, because they started off the new service year with a new alltime peak of thirty-four publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twice during the year the circuit servant and his wife were able to encourage the brothers with brief visits when the ship on which they were traveling called there for part of a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TAHITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,550</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Illustrating what can be done when a congregation really backs up Magazine Day activity, was the report of 1,342 magazines that were placed by 42 publishers using seven cars in just one whole day’s work. Besides this, there were more than a hundred booklets placed on that same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the Kingdom message is preached earth-wide today is well borne out by the following experience: A man doing his military service in France was surprised to see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> new recruit refuse to take the military costume he was ordered to put on. He later learned that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, concerning which religion he had never heard before. However, the incident started him thinking and aroused his interest in the truth. He determined to know more about it, but could not do very much about it while doing his military service. On completion of his service, he returned to Tahiti and was pleasantly surprised when a magazine to which he had never subscribed was regularly mailed to him. It was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine, published by Jehovah’s witnesses, whom he was still trying to find. The subscription was in his name and was sent to his country address, and it was only months later that he learned that the postman had made a mistake, as the subscription was really for one of his relatives, a person by the same name. When at last the brothers called at his home, he asked many questions, all of which were written down on many sheets of paper. A Bible study was soon started with him, and now both he and his wife are taking the truth to others. Truly, wherever we go in the earth we cannot get away from the good news of the Kingdom, which Jesus said would be preached earth-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TONGA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,537</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The brother caring for the isolated group made a very fine effort in April to share in the special talk activity for that month. Although he had never given </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> talk before, he handled the manuscript talk, and the work of the group in advertising the talk was well rewarded with an attendance of twenty-two persons. Since that time there have been, on an average, eighteen at the weekly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, and almost the same number for the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an indication of the group’s desire to progress in the truth, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study material is translated into the Tongan language by a brother each month, copies are made of it by hand, and this is then used by the group as their study material. The same thing is done with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book, and in this way the group has been able to make advancement to maturity even though understanding little English. They are now talking of building a Kingdom Hall, and three sites are available to them for this purpose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer sister conducted a study with a woman who showed much interest in the message. However, during almost a whole year of studying she never made any real effort to start associating with the congregation, mainly due to the fact that she was living with her sister who was bitterly opposed to the truth. Then one day when the special pioneer called to conduct the study only the opposed sister was at the home. When she saw the pioneer approaching she turned her back on her and said in a loud voice: “You go away, and stop telling us those lies.” The pioneer sister asked her what made her say such a thing. She replied: “Well, you people teach that we don’t go to heaven, do you not?” The special pioneer decided that the best thing to do would be to let the Bible set matters straight, so she drew it out of her witnessing bag and showed the opposing lady why it was that not all people will go to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lady was so surprised at the Scripturalness of it all that she started asking many other questions, to which she received satisfying answers. She apologized for what she had said and begged to be allowed to join in the study, which she did the very next day. She has made excellent progress since, enrolling in the ministry school and starting out in the ministry. She has also expressed a desire to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FINLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,580,195</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There has been good growth to spiritual maturity during the past year in Finland, and the brothers enjoyed the upbuilding program of the “Fruitage of the Spirit” district assembly; and now they are looking forward to the international assembly to be held in Helsinki in the summer of 1965 in the Olympic Stadium. The branch servant says that all are welcome. Meetings have a very telling effect on those attending for the first time and they are especially upbuilding for those who attend regularly. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One experience confirms the advice given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> that we should ask visitors to accompany us to the meetings if they happen to call on us on meeting night. In one congregation this advice was put into effect and it proved to be a blessing to them. Two publishers had called on a paralyzed woman several times, but they had never met her husband. Then the husband became so ill that he was not able to do heavy work anymore and so he started to make different kinds of brooms and brushes. When the congregation servant’s wife heard about it, she ordered all that she could possibly use in her household, thinking that she could in that way help that interested woman. It then happened that one Friday evening the man came to bring the ordered brushes, and, as it was meeting night, he was asked to stay. He did not have any idea what sort of meetings these were, but, because he got a friendly invitation, he said: “If I'm not in the way, I will gladly stay.” At the end of the meeting an announcement was made about the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, which was to be held on Sunday, and, to our great joy, he was there too. From that time onward he has been present regularly at every meeting. At the third </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study he attended, he put up his hand when the second question was asked and said: “Please excuse me, but as I am not familiar with this system of study yet, I would like to ask if it would be permissible to use notes when answering?” When he was given permission to do it, he took his notes from his pocket and with their aid gave answers that surprised us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A month from his first meeting he joined the theocratic ministry school. When giving his first student talk, which was a Bible reading, he began it this way: “Before I give this, my first student talk, I thank Jehovah that I have by his goodness come in contact with the truth, and I also thank the brothers and sisters that have taught it to me, and so I hope and pray to Jehovah that I will grow into a tree that bears much fruit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sundays the whole family, father, mother and four children, are regularly at the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, and the father has prepared the study material with his family ahead of time. He is already dedicated and zealously takes part in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regular attendance at the meetings is also a manifestation of spiritual maturity. A sister who has more than four miles to go to the meetings found a way to overcome the problem she has of attending meetings with four small children. Her husband is not in the truth and so he does not give any assistance in this matter. The sister has a bicycle, and she uses it to solve her problem. As the law forbids the carrying of more than two children on a bicycle at one time, she takes the two eldest children a third of the way and leaves them to walk while she goes back for the other two. These two she takes to the Kingdom Hall and then goes back for the two that are walking. All this takes her an hour and a half, but she is happy that she is able to be in attendance at the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 48,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 21,750 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,216</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is truly encouraging to see the progress that has been made by Jehovah’s witnesses in France. The publishers have increased in number steadily throughout the year and 2,026 were baptized, showing their desire to flee from Babylon the Great and dedicate their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will. Interesting too is the fine increase in the pioneer work. Many are trying out the vacation pioneer service and are proving to themselves that they can become pioneers after making certain arrangements. Even though the number of congregation publishers passed 20,000, on the average, during the year, still they increased their average hours, which are now up to 9.4 per congregation publisher. They are doing splendidly, and here are some reports on experiences from France, Algeria, Mali, Senegal Republic and Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses who are old, infirm or sick also serve their Creator wholeheartedly, and seize all opportunities, principally by writing, to give a witness. A sister who has been ill for many years is always regular in the service. She gives the witness by means of letters and sends publications to bereaved families. She rarely receives a reply to her letters. However, four years ago she did receive a reply from a man living in a small village. This man wrote to say how thankful he was to receive such a letter. The sister replied and sent this man a Bible and also the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font4"> She wrote to him several times but did not get a reply. So she stopped writing. Four years later the sister wrote this man again. He replied that he was very interested in the Word of God, and soon she received news that this gentleman and his wife intended to come and visit her. The visit took place at the time stated. They had to make a special effort, traveling forty-five miles by bus and walking thirty minutes in the rain. The man had brought along his Bible, and the discussion turned toward the worship of images and idols. The man said: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font4"> don’t see any crucifix in your home.” The sister tactfully explained what the Bible has to say about this subject, showing that Jehovah forbids this form of worship. Then the man said to his wife: “When we get home, even before I change my clothes, the first thing I will do is to get rid of the crucifixes and all the other idols we have in the house.” Before they left, the sister presented the couple with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font4"> Since this visit the sister has given the address of this man to the congregation nearest his home, and now a regular home Bible study is being conducted there. Further, the husband now attends the study at the Kingdom Hall on Sundays. What a joy for this sister, who though handicapped by sickness is always regular in the service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The placing of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine offers many occasions to help sincere persons to know Bible truths. About two years ago a publisher met two persons at a door. One of them had little time to talk but subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font4"> while the other person, the householder, took the current magazine. Later a home Bible study was conducted with the householder, and the sister who was conducting the study again met the person who had subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> This lady asked many questions about various subjects, particularly about fornication, adultery and divorce. Since this lady was going to stay several days at this home, the sister suggested to her that she come to give her more information from the Bible concerning the subjects that interested her. This interview took place and lasted for two hours. What the Word of God says about fornication, adultery and divorce made a great impression on her. Having returned to her home, this lady wrote to the sister several weeks later, telling her that what she had learned from the Bible weighed heavily on her mind. She said she wanted to live in harmony with God’s righteous principles concerning morality, which she could not do up till then because she was living with a man to whom she was not married. She made known to this man that she no longer desired to live in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> condition that was not pleasing to Jehovah. He had also read the magazine and understood that he should do something about it. So he said: “Why must we separate? Let us put our lives in order by becoming married legally, and let us learn God’s Word together.” This was done. As soon as they were married, the lady wrote to the sister asking to be visited and to have a home Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. This couple is now active in the service and both desire to be baptized. This is also true of the lady who first accepted the home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ALGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A young Algerian woman, mother of five children, was contacted with the truth in the door-to-door work. She accepted the publications and a study was started. When the lady’s husband saw how his wife was taking in knowledge, he ordered her to stop reading the books and booklets. This greatly discouraged her, but since she was eager to know more, it was decided to continue to hold the study—with care and discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning the young woman would say: “I shall never be able to study and retain all the things you are telling me and take care of my five children!” The sister had two children, so she understood the situation very well; and she continued to teach this young woman with much tact and patience. Now a year and a half has gone by, and the study has been held each week. Since this young person began to study she has taken good care of her home and has seen to it that everything is clean and in order, which is not an easy thing when one has five young children. She has arranged that the youngest children sleep for two hours during the afternoon, and thus she is free to study the Society’s publications privately, having finished her housework beforehand. She has also arranged to conduct a Bible study regularly each week for her oldest child. She has taken every opportunity to speak of the truth to her friends and relatives and thus has been able to witness to her niece, who is nineteen years old. This niece now has a regular study by correspondence with the sister. Thus this publisher is now beginning to see the fruit of her perseverance in spite of difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are two African pioneers working in Mali, proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom. The conditions in the country are difficult, but they do not let this deter them. They have learned the language of the country and they are happy to make known Jehovah’s name and his purposes. A European couple have now joined these pioneers in this blessed service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people here are kind and hospitable and listen attentively to the message of God’s kingdom. The conditions make it easy to reach persons who have key positions, and a good witness is given.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The parents of a young girl of twelve forbade her to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. This young girl had a cousin ten years of age, and the cousin’s mother was a Witness. So the young Catholic girl decided to study the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained </span><span class="font4">with her cousin, unknown to her parents. After several months of study she decided to refuse to attend the Catholic Church, in spite of the insistence of her parents. In order to persuade the child, the parents invited the priest to come and talk to her. The young girl asked the priest why the Catholic Church did not teach the Bible. He replied that the church did teach the Bible; so she asked him to explain the meaning of Armageddon. When he confessed he had never heard of it, the girl took the occasion to explain Armageddon before the priest and her parents, and also gave a witness concerning Jehovah’s purpose to establish a new system. The priest was dumbfounded. When he had recovered himself, he turned to the parents and said: “Why do you want to force your child to attend the mass? Let her continue to do what she is doing. When she is older she will come back to us.” Then, turning to the young girl, he said: “That’s fine, my child, you know more than those who attend church. It may be you are right. We don’t know!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“The integrity of the upright ones is what leads them.” (Prov. 11:3) It is heartening to see how these words are observed even by interested persons, as the following experience will show. A study had been conducted for several months with a married couple. They learned of the Christian attitude concerning the use of blood, and maintained this attitude when invited to a meal at their cousins’ home. Unbled chicken was served during the meal; but when the couple learned that it not been drained of its blood, they refused to eat of it and passed the dish along. The cousins were hostile to the truth and insisted that the chicken had been bled. One of them said: “Go on, eat it. I’ll take the responsibility for your sin.” At this, one of the seekers of truth replied: “Haven’t you enough sins of your own without taking on yourself ours?” Finally they admitted that the chicken had not been bled. They wanted these sheeplike persons to transgress God’s commandment, but this couple preferred to obey God rather than please their cousins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This same couple had a child last February, but did not baptize the baby according to the Catholic tradition. This brought further criticism from their cousins, so the father of the child suggested to his cousins that the question of baptism be discussed with a Catholic priest. An appeal was made to four priests, but not one of them would agree to discuss this matter with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, thus showing the weakness of their position.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark165"></a>People are continually fleeing from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. In Western Germany many are associating themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses. The activity of the Kingdom publishers there has been richly blessed by Jehovah, and their busy hours spent in preaching the good news have borne good fruit. The branch office in Wiesbaden gives us some interesting experiences on what is going on in Western Germany and in West Berlin, the island city in Communist East Germany.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We are very pleased with the total of 271,572 books distributed this year, as compared to 193,967 in 1963. This is primarily due to the release of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</span><span class="font4"> It was possible to place 70,168 copies of this marvelous publication in the hands of interested people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this campaign a brother called on a family that had made a pilgrimage to Lourdes in the hope of seeing a miracle performed on a blind person, but had to return disappointed. After the brother had given his sermon, this family took the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font4"> and the publisher arranged for a return call. At the return call the interested woman gave him an address and requested that he visit this person and bring her a Bible. As he drove back after making the call a young girl about eighteen years of age was waiting at the edge of town and motioned for him to stop. She then inquired if he was the witness of Jehovah who had been in town two weeks ago. She requested that he drive a short distance farther and she would walk to his car in order that no one could observe them. After she reached his car she asked for a Bible that contained God’s name, as her father had refused to obtain a copy; but she had listened to the conversation and now she would like to have a Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the campaign a brother visited the wife of an editor. After she had taken note of the value of this translation she expressed her desire to speak first with her husband and also her daughter, who was attending high school. She requested that the brother call again the following morning. Upon making the call the next morning he was welcomed by the editor himself, who said: “You are calling regarding the Bible. Yes, we want it.” The daughter was also very pleased about it and wanted to take the Bible to school. (In Germany they have religious instruction in school and sometimes use the Bible.) The following morning this girl came to the home of the congregation servant and asked for two more copies to give to two fellow students. In school they had already spoken with their clergyman respecting the preferable usage of “happy” instead of “blessed.” Another brother sent a Bible to a caretaker in one of the many schools used for dormitory sleeping accommodations during the convention in Munich. In his enthusiasm about this present the caretaker said to another brother: “It is the first Bible that has been offered to me, although many Christians of all different confessions have been my guests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes interested people make very rapid progress in the truth, whereas in other cases considerable time is needed. An elderly brother seventy years of age who regularly visits families through a magazine route experienced this. A businesswoman was among those who always took magazines but had very little time to listen to the brother. However, one day she felt compassion for him and thought of how he had been coming regularly for many years, so now she wanted to do him a favor by listening to him. The brother’s sermon aroused her interest and that of her husband to the extent that a study was immediately started with them. After only a few calls she knew this was the truth. Her husband immediately wrote to his sister in southern Germany and encouraged her to look for Jehovah’s witnesses, as they have the truth. Their relatives searched for Jehovah’s witnesses and found them doing magazine work on the street. It was possible to start a study right away, and her son participated in it. The results of this untiring service by a brother seventy years of age who regularly visited all families in his magazine route were nine persons taking up the service for Jehovah within one year. Five of them have already symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. Perseverance in this feature of service was greatly blessed by Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Since the Communists built their wall through the middle of Berlin, it has not been possible for our brothers from East Berlin and East Germany to have Christian association with their brothers in West Berlin. Meeting at circuit and district assemblies was always an occasion of blessing for both groups. For that reason, after years of strict separation, many brothers from West Berlin used the agreement between East and West Berlin officials in December 1963, which permitted residents of West Berlin to visit their relatives in the eastern section of the city, as an opportunity to visit their brothers and strengthen them in their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A sister who is seventy years of age tried to expand her service by talking to persons in the park and afterward going to the cemetery where people were caring for the graves of relatives, and she found many receptive people. She inquired about the address of those she talked to and gave these addresses to publishers of the proper congregation in order that they might call on them and start Bible studies. When this sister met them again after several weeks, they often told her of how they were now studying and mentioned who was visiting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was also a “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assembly in Berlin, which greatly strengthened the brothers. We had 7,863 persons in attendance at the public lecture, and 88 persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. These figures give rise to the hope that during the new service year the increase will continue in this “island city.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It has been another joyful year of service for Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana even though worsening economic conditions and pressures have brought testings during the year on those who have dedicated their lives to serve Jehovah. However, these problems bring the brothers closer together and strengthen them for trials ahead. Schoolchildren have had to stand firm for right worship. There were two court cases involving children’s refusal to violate God’s law on idolatry. The children have given a good account of themselves in the courts, and the final decisions were favorable. The territory that the branch in Ghana looks after includes the Ivory Coast, Togoland and Upper Volta. Experiences from these countries are set out here. During the year special efforts were put forth to revive some of those who became inactive in their Christian ministry, and good results have been obtained. Here is the report on what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A publisher was assigned to assist two inactive ones who live in a small village. A study was started and shortly the two were again active in the ministry, reporting fifteen hours each. The assistance rendered made a deep impression on the people and, as a direct result, fifteen in the village obtained copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book and five subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">Shortly afterward four of these walked the ten miles round trip to attend the public meeting during the circuit servant’s visit, and after only two months of study two new persons began to have a share in the house-to-house ministry with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was arranged that a group book study center be opened in the village, and over fifteen were in regular attendance each week. One person donated a kerosene lantern for the weekly studies, and another devotes time each week to teach the illiterate ones how to read and write so that they can make more progress in the faith. All this was a result of aiding two spiritually sick ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Circuit ministers in Ghana are having good success in visiting inactive ones on Wednesday evenings with the congregational overseers in the congregations they visit. Usually the problems are small, but encouragement and understanding are needed. In one case timidity was the problem, in another it was poverty and a large family, and in still another it was lack of knowledge of how to dress properly for the field ministry. One circuit servant has a list of fourteen main points to keep in mind for helping those who are spiritually sick and who become inactive. This has proved helpful, and many have been aided by the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Literacy classes have continued and now it is mostly the older ones and those having difficulties in learning who are being taught, so progress has not been so rapid as formeriy. Illiteracy is a big problem in the country, so we are pleased that 65 percent of the publishers can now read. In one area the officials of the government “Mass Education” unit placed Jehovah’s witnesses as first in numbers of those learning to read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Threats of opposition or persecution cause many to make a determined decision to stick with those who have Jehovah’s approval, even if they are not popular with the world. A man who was a presbyter in the local church and his wife began to take their stand for the truth. One morning the newspapers told of a parliamentarian’s appeal, based on false reports he had received, to have Jehovah’s witnesses banned. This caused considerable stir in the country, and one of the church members approached this interested person with the article and told him that he ought to come back to the church, as his “new church” was to be banned. The answer was: “Christ said true Christians will be persecuted, and I ever expected that in the Presbyterian church, but it was not fulfilled on me there. If now, by being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, I am going to taste persecution, then it is good news that you have brought me this morning. Thank you very much for making this known to me, since I cannot read English, as it has served to build my faith in Jehovah’s organization.” This man and his wife have now both taken a firm hold of the truth and are very zealous in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IVORY COAST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 143 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 22,378</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A district assembly was held in the capital during March. Due to government restrictions the assembly had to be changed to a private meeting, but many interested persons attended the assembly and enjoyed the edifying program along with the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of the service year the congregation in the capital city of Abidjan was organized into two units for the convenience of the publishers and to care better for the interested persons in two sections of the city. As yet little preaching is being done in the interior, but as the group of Christian witnesses continues to grow, the people are being contacted with the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOGOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,440,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During the year four missionaries from Germany were allowed entry into the country, and their assistance is very much appreciated by all the brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very young children can learn of God’s purposes and be instrumental in aiding others on the road to life, as one parent found out. This person had love for the truth, but since his wife was giving him some trouble he wanted to divorce her unscripturally and marry another. With this in mind he stopped attending meetings and going out in the service. But his young son of five years had been coming to meetings with his father regularly and was dismayed that he was no longer able to go. He started to worry his father to know the reason for this sudden stop, but the father did not want to tell his son his wrong motive. The boy persisted, asking the same question at every meal. Finally, one day the boy simply refused to go to school. The father asked him why and the boy replied: “Because you refuse to go to the meetings to serve God, I refuse to go to school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This bold stand shocked the father and made him think. Upright Bible principles won out, and the man decided to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes instead of what was convenient to him. Both father and son again attend meetings and have a share in the public ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UPPER VOLTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,467,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From September to February three special pioneers and a number of publishers preached the good news in this country. Good work was done and interested persons were found, but this soon aroused the anger of the religious clergy. In particular the Roman Catholic clergy misrepresented the Witnesses before the authorities and published papers against the Christian work they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On February 19 the publishers were all arrested and detained for thirteen days without food. Under the influence of the clergy the officials expelled all from the country because, as they said, “the government does not like Jehovah’s witnesses’ religion in Upper Volta.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GREECE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,832 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 785</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a long time it was impossible to visit the people in the open country in Greece, but during the past few years Jehovah has opened the door and a tremendous witness has been given in many of the villages scattered throughout the land. Thousands of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines were distributed during the summer months when the publishers of the Kingdom got out into isolated territory. In these villages many “sheep” were found. The brothers in Greece do not have the freedom of assembly that our brothers in many other nations of the world have, but this does not dampen their zeal. They do manage to get together to talk over the Bible, and they study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in small groups. They express their zeal and love for Jehovah God by going from house to house and village to village, just as the apostles did in the early days of Christianity. Here are some experiences sent in from the Greek branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one town the owner of a bookstore publishes a religious tract in which he very often writes defamatory information about Jehovah’s witnesses. He says, among other things, that the Witnesses have their own Bible. One day a sister went into his store and asked for a Bible. She said to the owner of the bookstore: “But please, I want a Bible of the Orthodox Church, not one of Jehovah’s witnesses’.” “Certainly, Madam,” he said, and he brought a Bible. The sister then opened it to Exodus 6:3 and read the name of Jehovah. “Please,” she said, “why have you deceived me? This is a Bible of the Witnesses; look here, it has the name Jehovah.” The man answered stupefied: “This is the Bible and there is only one Bible.” Then the sister pulled out from her bag his leaflet and asked him why he writes that Jehovah’s witnesses have their own Bible. From then on he stopped writing his lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A congregation overseer working in the open country with two brothers visited a flour mill, and to avoid being mistaken for tax collectors, since they had their briefcases in hand, they immediately approached the owner with a smile and said they were Jehovah’s witnesses. Then the owner invited the Witnesses in and said he knew about them as being people of integrity, but he lost them from sight for some time. As the Witnesses began talking, he invited his personnel to stop working and come to listen. Seven people heard the message, and the owner took magazines for all and paid for them himself. He also requested that the Witnesses call again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even by correspondence it is possible to give a good witness, as the following experience shows. In a village of Macedonia a couple has shown interest in the truth. But for financial reasons the husband was obliged to leave the country and look for a job abroad. Sometime later a visit was paid to the wife, whose interest was revived. She gave the brothers the address of her husband. The brothers wrote and received the following answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Dear Friend, I received your letter and I confess that I enjoyed its contents very much. Your words brought me much comfort. I appreciate very much your having spent time to write me. Two months ago I abandoned the way of truth and started going toward complete ruin. But your letter has helped me. I cannot find the right words to express my thanks because you renewed my courage and hope in Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“From now on I hope to be able to continue walking in the way of truth. I opened my Bible and found all the scriptures given in your letter. If some brother could be found here, I would appreciate his help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The man read this letter to the people dwelling in the same house with him, and as a result another young man became interested, and now both are progressing in their study and understanding of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GUADELOUPE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;283,223</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 494 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 573</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The French-speaking territories of the Caribbean—Guadeloupe, Martinique and South American French Guiana—have received a good witness during the past year. One thing that proved to be a rich blessing to them was the Society’s new film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World.” It made all those who saw the film do a lot of thinking and proved to be a rich blessing. Many have been the experiences of the brothers in these French-speaking lands, and here are some of them from the branch report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Parents, teach your children, could be the lesson one can draw from the following experience. A sister who is mother of ten children had one of them badly injured by falling from a tree. After several weeks he had to go to the hospital. The sister knew that there was little chance for her child of eight years to keep living. An operation met with no success and after a short while his condition worsened. A blood transfusion was ordered, but the child’s position was firm and he said: “My mother is one of Jehovah’s witnesses and she told me that the Bible says that it is against God’s law to use blood, so I don’t want that.” In view of his firm decision nothing was done. When the child appeared to be living his last moments, a Catholic nun came to tell him he would receive the “last communion.” He replied: “I don’t want that! My mother is one of Jehovah’s witnesses and I want to be on my mother’s side and follow my mother’s religion. Please do not give me that!” The child died, but in spite of his young age he knew how to take his stand on these issues. This made his mother’s grief easier, and she is confident that Jehovah will remember him in the resurrection. This shows that teaching children is a very serious matter for the parents. —Prov. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH GUIANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,905</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Often when going from house to house we find that many people are not home. The following experience shows how important it is to take note of the absentees and pay them a visit too. A publisher who noted an absentee paid him a visit the next Sunday. The householder showed a keen interest in the message and tried to find money to take the magazines. Seeing the evident interest of the man, the publisher said: “I am going to leave both magazines for you in spite of the fact that you do not have the complete contribution for them.” The householder was so moved by this manifestation of Christian love that he readily agreed to an appointment for another call. A back-call was made, followed by a very interesting discussion, and a Bible study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet was established. His wife joined him afterward, and they made good progress. After a while they manifested the desire to go out in the field service, but he had to straighten out his moral condition first. In spite of many difficulties he got married to his concubine, and today both are dedicated, baptized Christians. The new sister shared the privilege of being a vacation pioneer. Yes, all this, just because absentees were noted and visited!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARTINIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;292,062</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When working in a rather distant territory two sisters met a young man twenty-five years old. He showed keen interest in the Bible and asked many questions. A Bible study was conducted through letters. Sometime afterward he was invited to attend a circuit assembly in Fort-de-France, where he was easily able to see the difference between the Roman church, in which he was an active member of a youth movement, and true Christianity in practice. So right afterward he started talking about the truth with his friends and especially with his fellow “bell ringer.” His friend was so astonished at how much knowledge he had got in so short a period of time, that he went to the priest and asked: “What is your view of Jehovah’s witnesses?” The priest made this very encouraging answer: “Between us, and for you only, Jehovah’s witnesses teach the truth.” You can imagine the joy </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the young man when his bellringer friend revealed the priest’s declaration. This just pushed him forward to know more about the Bible and its Christian teachings. He was literally stunned to find his own religious teachings were all false! He made so much progress that shortly afterward he said to the sister with whom he studied: “I have decided to stop smoking, and also to stop being a bell ringer! I have already warned of my decision.” So the truth once more has triumphed and freed a creature from the fear of man. He is now a singer of Jehovah’s praises, as zealous as he was when ringing the bells that teach nothing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GUATEMALA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,278,341</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The service year in Guatemala began with fifty publishers attending the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in Pasadena, California, and they brought back good news to their fellow workers in Guatemala. It is truly wonderful how Jehovah’s witnesses travel from country to country to assemble with their brothers in international assemblies, and Guatemala had a good representation at the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly. They are looking forward to the time when many travelers will be coming through Guatemala, probably in 1966, because the publishers of the Kingdom are not forgetting that the president of the Society said that very likely in December of 1966 a grand series of conventions would be held in Central and South America. The branch servant of Guatemala sends us some interesting reports on what is going on there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At three circuit assemblies 3,440 persons saw the new film provided by the Society, and over 8,000 have seen the film since it was first presented in Guatemala. All who see it are delighted by the excellent way that it presents its message. At one place arrangements were made for an outdoor showing of the new film in a rural community of about 800 inhabitants. A friendly person provided electricity from a small power plant, and the “screen,” according to local custom, was the whitewashed outside wall of the small Catholic church. A few minutes before the time scheduled for beginning the film the church bells began to ring to call the people for evening prayer. Peaceably several hundred persons gathered together. Over 500 stood outside the church to see the most interesting presentation in proof of false religion’s Babylonian origin, while less than a dozen entered the church for the religious service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day a man came to the branch office with a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book in his hands and he wanted to ask questions. ‘Why were the scriptures quoted not exactly the same as those found in his Bible?’ The answer: “Basically they are the same, but there are different versions of the Bible.” Later it turned out that his religion had never really taught him how to find texts properly in the Bible. ‘Why did his Protestant friends say that the book was harmful, while he enjoyed reading it so much?’ After some explanations he said: “They told me that you did not believe in the holy spirit, but there on the wall I see the text ‘Filled with holy spirit.’ ” A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> book was placed with him and he agreed to come each week to study. After three studies he stopped coming, so the publisher located his home. The reason for not coming was that he felt unable to answer the questions. The study was continued at his home, with his wife and three children attending. After the first family study the children were shown the value of learning the names of the books of the Bible. The next week at study time all three children could repeat the names of the books of the Bible from memory. They report that every night they study the Bible, some are attending the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, and the man has expressed a desire to participate in preaching and is asking about dedication. So opposition often helps the sheeplike ones to find the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HAITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,384,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,193 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,887</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Republic of Haiti had another year of political difficulties, and, in addition to that, a hurricane hit the island. Despite this the work moves on steadily because Jehovah’s witnesses are persistent and boldly move ahead preaching the “everlasting good news.” They arranged for and had a very successful convention in Port-au-Prince. There were 1,570 who heard the public lecture, and 1,124 adopted the resolution of last year. Our Haitian brothers are getting good cooperation from the local authorities, and the country received its greatest witness as far as hours devoted to the preaching of the good news are concerned. Here are two experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lady with whom I am conducting a home Bible study told me that the parish priest was visiting one day. Taking advantage of the occasion, she asked the following question: “Why do Catholics use images in the churches, knowing that this practice is condemned by the Bible?’’ The priest replied: “They don’t worship them; images are honored as emblems.” But she said to the priest: “In the Bible we are told not to make any graven likeness of anything that is in the heavens above, on the earth, or in the waters below the earth.” The priest, greatly surprised, exclaimed: “Are you studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses? I am going to bring a Catholic Bible; it will help you to see for yourself how the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses are unchristian.” Soon the priest brought her the Catholic Bible. But instead of discouraging her, she was aided to make comparisons between the Catholic Bible and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> and this helped her to make more progress in her Bible study as she found the teaching of the Witnesses is in harmony with the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One afternoon two pioneers went out to conduct home Bible studies and make back-calls. On the way a Baptist pastor tried to molest them, saying with loud voice: “Here come those Witnesses, the false prophets.” But one of his own church members who was on the spot made this remark: “O no, these men are not false prophets, they are ministers of God following the command of Jesus in Matthew 28:19. Instead of mocking them, you should encourage them and help them to carry on their preaching work.” The pastor on hearing the remark disappeared, and the sheeplike person made arrangements with the pioneers for a home Bible study. Today he is one of our most zealous Bible students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;701,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 340</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Hawaiian brothers are still giving a friendly invitation to all the sheeplike people to come out of Babylon the Great. They have trained many of those who have taken a stand for Jehovah to say “Come” also. Good progress has been made during the year, especially with those attending the 2,346 Bible studies in the islands. An interesting experience was sent in from Hawaii, and we have also received a report on the Marshall Islands, where work began for the first time this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to a siege of illness a new publisher found himself alone for prestudy activity. His first thought was to return home, but, instead, he turned to Jehovah in prayer and asked for strength and courage to go alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His first knock was answered by a young man whose mother subscribed for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. The brother proceeded to show him why it was necessary to take in life-giving knowledge. This interested person noted how easy it was to understand the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font4"> and arrangements were made to bring a copy to him the following Sunday. He eagerly accepted the Bible, but shyly pointed out that he did not know how to use one. With that the brother offered not only to help him learn to use the Bible but to do so with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </span><span class="font4">After one year of study this young man symbolized his dedication and now has two Bible studies of his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How happy the brother was, not only that Jehovah strengthened him and directed him to his first home Bible study, but also that his first Bible student became a dedicated servant of Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARSHALL. ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,710</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At the close of this service year there are two dedicated publishers letting the light of Jehovah’s Word shine on the island of Majuro. They have been greatly aided by a recent visit of the circuit servant, who spent ten days with them and showed the film “Divine Will International Assembly.” At the close of this service year there are eleven studies in progress, with five joining in the preaching work. This is a great help, as the new publishers and the brother and sister can assist one another with the Marshallese and English languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two dedicated publishers are happy to be used by Jehovah in this vast area where there are no Witnesses for His name. A call of welcome is being sounded for others to come serve in the islands where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,068,063</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 791 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,614</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is necessary to pay very close attention to all the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in all the world. It makes no difference whether one is high or low in the organization, each one needs spiritual food. It is necessary to bring to maturity as rapidly as possible those who are publishing the good news of the Kingdom, and one should go out of his way to help others. Sometimes when this is done a greater blessing comes to the one who is putting forth the effort to help the isolated one. Here are some very interesting experiences of what took place in Honduras during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The need for each one to accept his own load of responsibility and to preach with boldness is well illustrated in this experience by one of our circuit servants. The circuit servant received notice that an isolated publisher from another circuit had moved into his circuit and so he arranged to visit him. Expecting to find a weak brother, isolated and somewhat discouraged, you can imagine his surprise when he found eleven publishers speaking the Word of God with boldness. Six of them were baptized after walking four miles to water. A baptism talk was given on the bank of the river, with fifty attending. This isolated brother wasted no time in directing the sheeplike ones to the organization and training them through a regular home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The need of keeping an accurate house-to-house record and later following up is highlighted in this experience. A magazine was placed with a man who was very poor but seemed sincere. Upon leaving, the publisher thought to herself, ‘I must call back on this man.’ But no record was made. Several times the sister had times when she could have called back but made other visits because she forgot this man as no record was made. You can imagine her surprise upon seeing the man and his wife one evening in the Kingdom Hall. Another sister had found this “sheep” and was studying with both him and his wife. The time came for one of our circuit assemblies down in a small, hot, coastal town and the passage was $2. This man saved his money until he had $3.75, almost the fare for himself and his wife. But then their three-month-old baby became ill and the medicine cost exactly what he had saved, $3.75. He did not become discouraged, but went out and got some lumber, made a few clothes hangers and sold them. The day came to pay the passage, and he had exactly what was needed, $4, with hopes of obtaining a little more for room and board at the assembly site. The assembly came and there they were with their three little ones. One day, after the cafeteria had closed, they came into the refreshment stand for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> sandwich and a drink. He was carrying a small child, his shirt plastered to him with perspiration from the hot tropical sun and she had the baby in her arms and the other little tot at her side. The publisher asked them if they had intended to go to the cafeteria, but he said: “No, we were out handing out invitations for the public lecture and the little one walks so slow we could not get back in time.” What zeal is shown now by these two Kingdom publishers and what a lesson was learned by the sister who failed to note on her house-to-house record this magazine placement!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 243 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 15,226</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The population of Hong Kong grows steadily each year. The people are crammed into a twenty-five-square-mile area, and many of them are refugees who have come from the mainland of Communist China. With these millions of people in such a small place Hong Kong proves to be a very busy city. But in among all the hustle and bustle of this metropolis Jehovah’s witnesses are going about doing their God-given work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom. As in other parts of the world, some listen and others do not. It is good to see, though, a steady increase in the number of those taking up the Christian activity and preaching the good news. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Hong Kong it is most difficult for young people to be active ministers of the good news. The schools give a very heavy schedule of homework and, due to there being so many students and so few jobs available on graduation, competition is very keen. The tendency is to devote all to one’s schoolwork and neglect meetings and service. One young sister proved that a practical schedule is the answer to getting both things done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She writes: “Last year was my busiest year, preparing for the School Certificate Examination. I was determined to attend all congregation meetings and reach all my goals in the ministry. I arranged a weekly schedule to care for my schoolwork, meetings and service, and I stuck to it. As a result, I have not missed any spiritual food, I have regularly met all my goals in the ministry and twice during the year I did vacation pioneering. And, what is more, I was successful in my school exams.” This young sister has benefited greatly from her determined effort to give spiritual things their proper place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two special pioneer sisters are now working in the Portuguese colony of Macau. Already two publishers share with them in the preaching work. Good work is being done in placing literature and obtaining subscriptions for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines. A good number of Bible studies have been started, and it is hoped that before very long the publishers will see some more fruitage for their work. Their reports are included with Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very little news of our brothers came out of China during the past year. Three letters that we received here all indicate that our brothers can do very little in preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indicating that there are few opportunities for preaching, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> sister writes: “I can’t help feeling a little disturbed, for I have not been able to accomplish much in the work. But when I know I am remembered by all you brothers I feel very grateful.” In the conclusion of her letter she says: “I meet some of our sisters now and then and we all feel the same, wondering when things will be better for us.” This sister, though, enclosed her report for the year for 143S hours, or an average of twelve hours each month!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So while there was very little news over the past year, yet it was sufficient to tell us that we do have brothers in China who are keeping integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;183,478</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,293</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For years it has been difficult to help the natives of Iceland to grasp the truth, because they have been steeped in both superstition and materialism. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine has helped greatly in aiding Icelanders to gain a knowledge of God’s Word, and Jehovah has raised up individuals who are interested in teaching the Word of God. Jehovah’s witnesses in Iceland are hard workers and are willing to go anywhere in the territory to get the truth preached. Herewith are a few experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here in Iceland we still have many territories that we are not able to work regularly all year, and some of them have not been worked for years because we have been concentrating on the more densely populated areas, where results were more likely to be had in a shorter time. However, we have been thinking of these territories, how in some way we could reach them; and this year, when there was no opportunity to go abroad to attend international assemblies, some of our good workers decided to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three of our hard-working sisters, all in the full-time service, went to an isolated place, Westmanna Islands. It is near the new volcanic island, Surtsey, which erupted right out of the ocean. They took with them a very young sister from the congregation in Reykjavik. There they stayed for about one week, covering all the territory of about 5,000 inhabitants, most of them fishermen. It was hard work; some days they preached from ten o’clock in the morning until ten o’clock at night, and they had to care for themselves in the meantime. However, they were overjoyed when counting what they had been able to place during the week: 302 bound books, 85 subscriptions and 1,366 single copies of the Icelandic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower!</span><span class="font4"> And the young sister, who was only twelve years of age and who had never worked alone from house to house until then, had her share in the work, being able to report a total of two subscriptions, 21 books and 75 magazines! Young publishers can really do well!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 444,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,125 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 208,941</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have had to face a new problem in India, one that their fellow workers in some other parts of the earth have had to face for some years. That problem is the issue of neutrality. With the intensifying of India’s defense preparations and the resultant expansion of military training in schools, those persons who claim to be Christians have had to take their stand. Some, who “loved the glory of men more than even the glory of God,” have changed their position when the tests of loyalty have come upon them. (John 12:43) But, then, it must be remembered that an organization always becomes stronger when the weaker ones flee. The branch servant has sent some very interesting experiences along with the year’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One special pioneer did a very commendable bit of work during his annual vacation: he went to work some faraway unassigned territory. This was up in the Garo hills on the borders of Assam and eastern Pakistan in a tribal area. This pioneer met a Hindu police officer in Shillong, married to a nominally Christian Garo woman, who showed some interest in the Bible. He was transferred to a small town in the Garo hills and kept up a correspondence with the special pioneer. He invited the pioneer to spend his holidays at his place and do some preaching, which was readily agreed to. The result? In two weeks ten books were placed, eight booklets and fifty-two magazines, which was all the literature he had, and then he took subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> with his last single copies. At the end of the vacation he had taken twenty subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The benefit of making a schedule and sticking to it is well illustrated in the following experience. A sister in south India with seven children is a regular pioneer. How does she manage it? She gets up quite early, feeds the cows, prepares food for the family, gets six of the children off to school, and is ready to leave home for witnessing by 7:30 a.m. She regularly puts in five hours in field service, and never misses the family Bible reading and study before going to bed. Her year’s report shows well over 1,600 hours of field service and an average of eight home Bible studies through the year. We recommend this fine example of what can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Standing outside the door of her assembly accommodation, an alert sister saw </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> young man passing by and engaged him in conversation. He was a Roman Catholic. Hearing about the “Lord’s prayer” and the mention of God’s name, he showed surprise. He went home and told his parents what the sister had told him, and this aroused their curiosity so much that they went to visit the sister. She told them about the assembly and invited them to the public talk on Sunday. They excused themselves, saying that they would be going to church. However, the sister suggested that they would probably get a lot more information from the Bible by attending the public talk than they would by going to church, and she promised to call for them. They went. Not only did they attend the public talk but stayed on for the final session, and now a local brother is having Bible studies with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant writes in to say that a certain brother in one of his congregations keeps a store and always makes a practice of hanging the Society’s calendar in a prominent place in his shop. By this means he does quite a lot of incidental witnessing, and especially when the calendar depicts some Oriental scene, as with the camels on the 1963 calendar. He frames all the calendars and has them year after year hanging on his wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INDONESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 103,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,140 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 90,351</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have enjoyed great expansion in their carrying on of true worship throughout the territory of Indonesia. The people are very friendly and receptive to the message of the Kingdom, and many have been liberated from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. The Protestant clergy in particular have been fighting desperately to hold their parishioners, and they have gone to great extremes to persecute the Christian witnesses of Jehovah. In many of the outlying islands of this vast territory the pressure has been great, as shown by some of the experiences reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerted schemes by the Protestant clergy and their Church Council, consisting of most of the Protestant sects, have had as their object to place Jehovah’s witnesses in a bad light with the local authorities in places where special pioneers are assigned. Patient endurance in the ministry along with Christian deportment in public and before the officials has opened the eyes of the honest-hearted “sheep” and the officials as to who are the genuine and lawful ministers of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of their methods is to send letters to government departments in the area and to other religious organizations, containing false charges and derogatory statemeats. Eventually some official will pass on such a letter to the pioneers, who promptly prepare a carefully worded letter and send copies to the same departments and organizations. This has enabled the officials to understand matters in true perspective. Shortly after one such letter was sent in reply, a high-ranking government official was prompted to announce in his public address that “the new government in Irian Barat forcefully maintains freedom of religion, and this also applies to newcomers in that field.” It was reported as the result of another letter on another island that a spokesman from headquarters for the church counseled his colleague to “let Jehovah’s Witnesses alone. They are waking up the sleepy Protestants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the city of Kupang on the island of Timor, a clergyman in one section of the city used the local church youth organization to terrorize the brothers. He was especially angry because several church members, including a prominent family that had been a source of financial income for the church, were taking a stand for the truth. Flattery and persuasion failing, threatening letters and ultimatums were sent. A boundary was marked off, forbidding the Witnesses to enter the kampong. Even children were taught to cry out to the passing Witnesses: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Ganjang Saksi* Jehuwa”</span><span class="font4"> (“Crush Jehovah’s witnesses”). The clergyman organized other youth organizations in the city to drive the Witnesses out. Church members were warned over the radio not to entertain Jehovah’s witnesses, leaflets were distributed and derogatory slogans scribbled on walls. Their activities almost succeeded until the clergyman made a bad mistake in his Sunday sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same hateful spirit to crush the Witnesses was organized in other islands. In some places the pioneers and publishers were forced to walk long distances and work in the rurals. On the island of Alor the clergy sent out a “Declaration of the Evangelical Faith.” The burden of their grief was the “apostasy” of Jehovah’s witnesses in not accepting the trinity doctrine, and denouncing them as the antichrist. It included an intense appeal to the authorities to evict the “antirevolutionaries” from recognized Protestant territory. Again the local authorities were properly enlightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The truth not only unites all kinds of people but also restores unity to broken family relationship. A sister who separated from her husband came to a knowledge of the truth and progressed to the point of being assigned as a special pioneer. On her own initiative she returned to her village with the purpose of arranging a reconciliation and to continue the full-time service there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the help of mature brothers who set things straight from the Bible on the marriage relationship, the husband was glad to receive back his estranged wife. She told her husband: “If it was not for the truth, we would certainly never have met again as husband and wife.” The husband, impressed with the changed conduct of his wife and her zealous work in the ministry, now receives Bible lessons from his wife. The village people welcomed her back and said it must be a fine religion to bring about such a miracle. Many of the villagers are now learning of this fine religion from her through weekly Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A local congregation servant who attended the Kingdom Ministry School felt that this was such a fine practical course that he arranged to extend the things that he had learned to his congregation. He invites the publishers to his house on his free night and gives them a “lightning course” over a period of several weeks. The publishers go through all the features of the house-to-house ministry, the back-call and Bible study work, which includes homework and preparation. They demonstrate what they have learned and are counseled accordingly. They are also trained in servant duties. It is not long before new servants, publishers and pioneers develop. Over the past few years around twenty special pioneers have come from this congregation to serve where the need is greater in the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 88 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 28,409</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A branch office was set up during the past service year to look after the increased interest that has been shown in the truth in Israel. The Society began to print </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> instead of mimeographing each edition. This proved to be very helpful, and we hope the increase of its distribution will continue in Israel. Publishers of the Kingdom must show patience and real sincerity in their witness work in order to convince the nationalistic Jews that God’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind. This is a task equal to any our brothers have around the world. But progress is being made. Here are a few reports sent in on what has occurred in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Witnesses who take advantage of talking to friends and workmates find that the truth often travels and multiplies in chain-reaction style. On her way to a meeting one sister met an old friend and, having explained where she was going, invited her friend to attend the study with her. She came along, was interested in what she heard, and readily responded to the suggestion of a home Bible study. Steady progress has been made. From an invitation by her husband to two of his workmates, a fine discussion resulted on two occasions. The wife of one was already having a Bible study with a local pioneer and was much encouraged by this sister, so soon she started to share in the service. The wife of the second had previously known of Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland and had tried to find the organization locally. Another Bible study was started with her and she too is now sharing regularly in the ministry; in fact, she has started a new study with a friend of hers and good progress has been reported. Through letters of encouragement, the mother and brother of one of these new sisters sought out the local brothers near their home in Poland and are studying the Bible there. Yes, besides witnessing from house to house, many fine opportunities present themselves to help acquaintances to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meeting other members of the family at a home Bible study is often helpful to the progress being made. One sister conducted a study with an interested person unknown to the lady’s husband. One day she was sick and her husband was home caring for her when the sister arrived for the study. Knowing that he had earlier objected to his wife’s studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, the sister was not surprised that he argued with her on this occasion. He listened to her reasonable arguments and answers and was impressed with the logic and good sense of what she said from the Bible. Turning to his wife, he asked: “Why can’t you explain things like this?”, to which she replied: “Because I am still learning, but I will be able to if I can continue!” The study has continued with the husband’s approval, and she gets to the congregation meetings accompanied by her young daughter and is out regularly in the service now. Incidentally, the study is conducted in the German language, the student using a textbook in Hungarian and a Croatian Bible!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 51,197,417</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,774 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,835</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark167"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in Italy had a joyful year speaking the Word of God with boldness. For the first time in the history of the work in Italy more than one million hours were spent in the field service declaring the good news of the Kingdom, and the brothers there enjoyed a 14-percent increase. When one looks back just ten years and observes that there were 2,587 different individuals proclaiming the good news, it gives one good cause for rejoicing to see that the theocratic organization has grown to 8,774 ministers preaching with boldness. Here are a few experiences from Italy and Libya.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A family of publishers went to the Milan “Everlasting Good News” Assembly in 1963. At that time they were assigned to stay with a Pentecostal household. Various publications were placed and a witness was given. Then the householder was kindly invited to attend a Bible talk at the assembly. This made a good impression. Before leaving, the Witnesses left the address with the local congregation so that some publisher would start a Bible study with the family. For some time they corresponded with each other; then there was a long period of silence. But one day the bell rang insistently, and when the door was opened there they were; the family they had met in Milan was visiting them. The questions were: Have they studied the Bible with the brothers? Are they still interested in the truth? The joyful reply was Yes. They were going to a circuit assembly, where one of them would symbolize his dedication to Jehovah by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fifteen-year-old brother was very anxious to start a Bible study with some one of his schoolmates. But his sincere efforts were always ridiculed. At the time of the Memorial he was able to bring one of his schoolmates to the talk on the Lord’s evening meal. But the interest of this young boy did not go any farther. While accompanying this young boy home, the brother met a friend of this schoolmate, who showed real interest in the Kingdom message. So the brother made an appointment to call back on him, and later he was able to start a Bible study with him. After studying with him for three months, this young person attended an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, and after three months he symbolized his dedication by water baptism. Now he is a zealous publisher who devotes a monthly average of twenty hours in the service. This year, during their vacation, both the brother and the newly baptized publisher did vacation pioneer work for several months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer in the city of M--- met a man</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">who said he was an atheist. When asked why, he said it ail happened when his baby died. He was so grieved that he gave vent to his feeling, hitting the hospital table with his fists. A nun who saw him said he was rebelling against the will of God. This man did not accept the idea that God was responsible for his son’s death and left the Catholic Church, believing in nothing else. His wife was a Protestant, and she tried to help him to get faith, inviting her clergyman. When the clergyman came, he was asked: “Why does God make babies die?” The clergyman answered that God needed that pure soul in paradise. Since the husband was not satisfied, the clergyman became angry and added that the baby died also because of the sins of his parents. Now this man asked the pioneer brother the same question. When he was given the answer from the Bible and understood what the cause of death is and also the hope of resurrection, he immediately agreed to a Bible study together with his wife. What comfort the Word of God, the Bible, is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,570,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 30,192</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A legal victory was won in the Court of Appeal of T----. This Court discussed a case in which several</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">brothers were involved. The trial had been deferred for years. At last the decision was made. The accused brothers were acquitted and the judge ordered the confiscated literature to be returned. This victory encouraged the local brothers to maintain their integrity and endure in fulfilling their Christian obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not always does the seed sown produce fruit right away. Many times it is necessary to show patience and perseverance before the fruit appears. In fact, an interested person heard someone talking about the truth four years ago. Later, because of some difficulties, he quit studying. Then he started again, and after many calls the truth really touched his heart. So he decided to tell the good news to his wife, from whom he was separated, and to his relatives, with whom he also had some differences. His wife accepted the truth, started a Bible study, and soon began preaching to others. The honest effort of this man to follow Bible principles was richly blessed, so that now after sixteen years of disunion he is with his family again and studies the Bible with them. His good example has motivated other relatives and even some neighbors to become interested in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The people in this land are friendly and hospitable and are willing to discuss God’s Word. The Bible is taught in the schools as part of the regular curriculum, so there is a tendency to accept it as true rather than to reject it, as is done in many other parts of the earth. When Jehovah’s witnesses visit homes, it is a rare thing not to be able to give the sermon. People listen and appreciate what you say, but that is as far as many will go. Jehovah’s witnesses continue to try, however, to get the people to do something with the life-giving waters of truth from the Word of God. Here are some experiences from the island of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are not confined to witnessing at the homes of the people only. They are happy to identify themselves as Jehovah’s ministers wherever they go. One of our congregation overseers was hospitalized for two weeks, and while in the hospital he was anxious to witness to the members of the staff as well as to other patients. A group of doctors and nurses visited his bedside each morning to examine him. So he turned the occasion into an opportunity for discussing the daily text in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> with them. He tactfully addressed the chief doctor, saying: “You all are attending me so well in a physical way. I wonder if I can attend to you in a spiritual way?” They were willing, so he introduced the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> Instead of reading just any text as it came up, each day he carefully selected certain texts and comments that these people could understand quite readily. He said that this group of doctors and nurses looked forward to their discussions each day, asking for the text to be read to them before they would leave his bed. Eventually he had the doctors taking turns at reading the text he selected for them. During the two-week stay in the hospital, the brother reported twelve hours of witnessing. He placed twelve magazines and one Bible, and obtained three subscriptions. The interest has been referred to the local congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus preached at the seaside, in the mountains and anywhere else that people could be found. Even when he had got away to rest, he took occasion to preach. Following in his footsteps, Jehovah’s witnesses seize all opportunities to talk of God’s kingdom. One Monday after serving a congregation a circuit servant and his wife went to the seaside to relax and swim. The beach they chose was also used by local commercial fishermen. This period of relaxation developed into greater pleasure for them as they started witnessing to one of the fishermen. He showed keen interest in the truth, accepted literature and welcomed these ministers to come to his home. The problem now was how to continue cultivating this interest in the truth. There were no Witnesses living nearby. So the circuit servant and his wife decided to make trips back to study the Bible with this man every Monday, which meant that they had to make adjustments in their weekly schedule and at times had to travel thirty miles to conduct the study. The outcome was worth the extra effort, for within a year the man made a dedication to do Jehovah’s will, was baptized in water in symbol of this, and has continued faithfully in this course although isolated from any congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAYMAN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,616</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 423</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A person favorably disposed toward the truth visited Grand Cayman Island from Cayman Brae. Among the purposes for his visit was to find Jehovah’s witnesses. In 1959 special pioneers had been working on Cayman Brae and met him in their door-to-door ministry. A Bible study had been conducted with him, but the pioneers had to return to their home in Jamaica because of ill health. So now this man was interested in locating Jehovah’s people. After making inquiries he was able to attend the meeting and resubscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> His question before returning home was: “When will more of Jehovah’s ministers be sent to Cayman Brae?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,716</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,429</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two special pioneers serving in the Turks and Caicos Islands. While the pioneers go from house to house seeking to build up the interest of the people in Jehovah’s promises, as outlined in his Word, the clergy go from house to house trying to discourage people from learning these things. A positive stand is being taken by some who do not fear men. A man was told by his wife that the pastor said that they were not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses. This open-minded man said that when he is told not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses, the person telling him that should be prepared to explain why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the pioneers have Bible studies they make it a point to direct the interest of their students to Jehovah’s organization. Public talks are arranged and delivered at various homes in order to help the people get established in association with Jehovah’s theocratic society. Interested people have offered their homes for regular use for meetings. One family allows their sitting hall to be used for a study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">Success has been realized in that eight persons now attend this study. For the service meeting and ministry school, another family has offered their home. This is being attended by six people. The fine training that the people are receiving is preparing them for the time when they too will engage in serving Jehovah publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 96,160,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,318 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 28,981</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year a new branch office building was dedicated to the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name and the expansion of theocratic interests in Japan. With this new building now being used by Jehovah’s witnesses, better service is being given to all the congregations. Putting up this new structure was most timely because the publishers continue to increase, and we are happy to report that there was an 18-percent growth in the number of those declaring the good news regularly throughout the whole island. Here are some very interesting experiences from Japan, Okinawa and the Sakishima Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though busy studying to graduate from high school, a young sister took the opportunity to talk with her classmates about the Bible. Realizing that after graduation she would be parting from her friends in school, she used one of the Society’s pamphlets to witness about the good news of the Kingdom. Following graduation she contacted one of these friends and aided her to attend the circuit assembly. There her friend saw the unity of God’s people, and a home Bible study was started. Later, thinking of the other school friends, she contacted them and aided them to attend assemblies and to study. Now, five years later, not only is she </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">special pioneer, but four of her school friends are too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One missionary found that making back-calls on persons who accept magazines in Magazine Day activity brings good results. Two magazines were left with a member of the Japan Christian Church Alliance and a back-call was made. While reading the magazines this person began to see the difference between the Bible teachings and the doctrines taught in her church. She asked the clergyman about it, and he said: “The Bible is like a big turnip that you buy at the vegetable store. You don’t use all of it. You just pick the soft juicy pieces and leave the rest. So, don’t worry about the more difficult parts.” Thoroughly disgusted with this explanation, she was happy to have the home Bible study, and is continuing to learn the truth of Jehovah and his Word. Recently she commented: “I was a stray sheep but now I am learning the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One sister who had never made any back-calls made a special effort to prepare, as she was scheduled to work with the circuit servant on one of the afternoons of his visit to the congregation. She went out by herself to some handy territory so that she could make some placements, write them down, and then be in position to have the circuit servant accompany her. However, when she went back with the circuit servant the only person who listened was a lady who had previously refused literature but who had accepted a free pamphlet. Together with the circuit servant, she was able to start a home Bible study and to obtain a subscription for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. She was extremely happy and expressed her desire to get to be more accomplished in the teaching work by regularly making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man who had quit his job to study the Japanese Shinto religion was contacted in the house-to-house ministry. The missionary made a few back-calls, and Scriptural discussions were held but no regular home Bible study could be started as he was due to leave for the ancient capital city of Nara to study Shintoism. Knowing that Nara is close to Kyoto, the location of the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly, she invited him to attend. The young man accepted the invitation and attended for the full five days. Hearing the Bible discourses and being impressed by the warm, friendly atmosphere, he became uncertain as to what he should do in the future. “Why not look into the Bible?” was the encouragement given. Accepting that wise direction, he canceled his scheduled Shinto schooling and returned to his hometown of Hiroshima.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Studying with Jehovah’s people three nights a week and attending all meetings at the Kingdom Hall and congregation service center, he quickly learned the truth. He began to preach and was baptized just four and a half months after the Kyoto assembly. Desiring to express his happiness and thanks for having found the knowledge and understanding of the true God, Jehovah, he applied for vacation pioneer privileges. Finishing his secular work at 4:15 p.m., he preached from house to house till 7 p.m. Now he is a regular pioneer and has had increased joy in seeing one person with whom he studies become a minister. Truly, Jehovah is gathering many from the clutches of Babylon the Great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The outstanding event during the year proved to be the “Fruitage of the Spirit” district assembly in the capital city of Naha. There was a peak of 220 publishers in August, representing a 21-percent increase, but how happy the brothers were to see 356 present for the public meeting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the first local brother to attend Gilead School returned and is serving as the circuit servant. Having reached a new peak of publishers in August, all are now looking forward to another year of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAKISHIMA ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;123,841</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The preaching of the good news was carried on for the first time this year in these islands in the East China Sea. That there are persons desirous of learning about Jehovah God and his new order can be seen in the fact that in just the short time of one year 279 subscriptions for the magazines were obtained and 13,169 magazines were placed. After studying for only six months one islander began to preach, and in the first month distributed 166 magazines during her 20 hours of service. Since then three others have joined her, and as a group they have averaged 13.7 hours and have distributed an average of 47.7 magazines. At the recent visit of the circuit servant 61 persons attended the public talk. We are looking forward to seeing further progress this coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,691,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 21,138</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Jordan enjoyed another year of theocratic progress, but it was not accomplished without much opposition. Efforts were again made to ban the Christian work of Jehovah’s witnesses, they being charged with Zionistic activities. The newspapers, the Arab Boycott organization and the clergy of Christendom continued to bring false charges to the government about Jehovah’s witnesses. The clergy especially tried to pressure the Moslem government of Jordan to revoke its recognition of Jehovah’s witnesses as a religious community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In December of 1963 the clergy charged that Jehovah’s witnesses were nothing more than Zionistic agents and brought this accusation before the government. Our enemies were so sure of the outcome that an Amman newspaper carried an article stating that the Jordanian government had banned Jehovah’s witnesses. Reading this in the newspaper, we were warned of what was going on. Various government officials were contacted and it was soon learned that no such decision had been made by the government. It was clearly explained to those in government offices that Jehovah’s witnesses do not participate in any way in political movements. Some fine discussions were had with them concerning our teaching, our belief in the one Supreme God and not in a trinity of gods. Our being Christians and yet not believing in the trinity pleased the Moslem officials very much, and some of them could see that the clergy of Christendom were trying to frame us. Finally, in April 1964, the cabinet ministers made a decision concerning Jehovah’s witnesses and they confirmed a previous decision, made in 1960, that granted Jehovah’s witnesses freedom of worship in Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then on June 1 a Jerusalem paper reported that the Arab Boycott of Israel had recommended that all Arab States ban Jehovah’s witnesses and close their branches by July 12. But what was alarming was the fact that this paper reported that the Jordanian government had agreed to follow the recommendation. But unknown to us at the time, the day before, or on May 31, the Prime Minister himself answered the local office of the Arab Boycott of Israel that the government’s decision had not changed and the decision of the cabinet on February 21, I960, still stood. Another victory! In just two short months the four-year-old decision granting us freedom of worship was confirmed twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy will use any means to stop people from studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, as is illustrated in this case: A priest offered a little girl, no more than ten years old, a cross and rosary if she would curse Jehovah’s witnesses. A study was being held with one of this little girl’s relatives. She really worked for her reward, and the study was finally discontinued. The householder no longer wanted to study. The little girl got her priestly gifts for good “Christian” services rendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, not all persons will be intimidated by the clergy or their tools. They realize that Jehovah’s witnesses teach only from the Bible. A priest visited one of his parishioners who was studying with a special pioneer sister. He asked why he had not seen her at church lately. She answered that she had someone come every week to her home for Bible studies. “Who are these people?” asked the priest. When she informed him that they were Jehovah’s witnesses, he told her that the government had banned Jehovah’s witnesses, that they are Jews and do not teach the Bible and that she should stop studying with them and come back to church. She replied that they have been coming a long time to her home and, from what she could see, they were good people and everything they say comes from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">En-gel</span><span class="font4"> (Gospels). But she would stop the study if the priest would come to her house every week and study the Bible with her. But he begged off—he was much too busy for that. “Well, then,” she said, “Jehovah’s witnesses will have to study with me and they are welcome at my house anytime.” With that the priest left, and he has not stopped to see her again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KENYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,104,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 179 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 50,860</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There is absolutely no problem at all in starting good, productive Bible studies,” is the report from Kenya. And this has proved to be true, because in Kenya they had a 15-percent increase in the number of publishers over last year’s average, and the publishers averaged one study per person. They say it is not long before the person with whom one studies is willing to share the good news with others. A number of persons who have learned the truth and who have dedicated their lives to serve God have left their employers and have returned to their own villages so that they might be able to teach those that they lived with during the earlier part of their lives. This also has contributed to the fine results in Kenya. The branch office sends in reports on Uganda, the United Republic of Tanganyika, the Seychelles Islands and Zanzibar, which was a separate country during the 1964 service year. Here are interesting experiences from these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Imagine the amazement of a brother working in one of the rural territories when a person he was visiting produced the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font4"> published by the Society as far back as 1928, thirty-six years ago! This person explained to the brother that he had loved the Bible since he was a child, and though he was brought up to attend church and had moved from one religion to another, what he heard just confused him. So he decided to study the Bible alone and then try to teach his family from what he had learned. One day his daughter on returning from school told him that she had learned of a hot place where the wicked go. He explained to the visiting brother: “Then I had to show her that hell was not a place of fire.” When his son reported that he had been taught that Jesus and God were the same person, the father said: “I had to show from the Bible that such an idea was not true.” He then explained to the brother that he owed his understanding of the Bible to the aid he had received from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font4"> His brother had come into possession of the book in 1935 and had given it to him while he was still a child, in 1942. However, he was not able to read sufficiently to understand the book until 1958. Then the seed of truth planted many years ago began to sprout. Since that time he had searched for more such books to explain further the truths he had begun to learn. When he was offered the new publications, he said joyfully: “I must have them all—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, Awake!,</span><span class="font4"> everything!” Now he is a regular meeting attender, and it seems that it will be but a little time until he becomes an enthusiastic minister in the great work of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SEYCHELLES ISLANDS Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 21,875</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the past few years various brothers have visited this group of small islands, but they were not able to stay for a sufficient length of time to build up the interest. However, a few years ago one of the islanders went to Tanganyika and, while employed there, embraced the truth and has since returned to his home in the islands, where he has been publishing regularly with his wife since last October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This couple are to be admired for their zeal in Jehovah’s service, as they work alone in the islands. They average around thirty hours each month and have recently built a new home with the chief purpose of having a suitable place to gather the interested people together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,190,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 194,324</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cleansing power of Jehovah’s Word is demonstrated in the following experience: It took just a few weeks of Bible study to convince the student that his bigamous marriage was out of harmony with Bible principles. He soon began to take steps to end his relationship with the second wife. This brought him considerable difficulty. The second wife made plans to poison the first wife, but fortunately the scheme was discovered before harm could be caused. Left with one Wife, the man, in his continued desire to live in accord with Bible principles and become acceptable as a publisher of the good news, has taken the further step of legalizing his marriage by registration with the government. The very next day after he had done this, he shared in the field service and was very happy when, on the second call, he met an interested person of his own tribe and a Bible study was started with him. As a result of faithfully following Bible counsel, this new publisher brings his wife along to the meetings and now conducts a regular study with his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TANGANYIKA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,798,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 855 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,460</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several experiences have been received during the year showing that many sincere persons are turning away from false religious teachings and are eagerly embracing the truth. One such experience concerns a special pioneer who was assigned to a town in northern Tanganyika on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. Together with an interested person he was invited one evening to the home of one of his Bible students for dinner. Several other persons were at the meal, including the local Anglican priest. A Scriptural discussion followed. Many Bible questions were asked by those present, which the priest failed to answer, whereas the pioneer gave satisfying Scriptural answers. This angered the priest at first, but later, upon seeing that several present were showing considerable appreciation for the answers they had received from the Bible, he admitted that Jehovah’s witnesses had a far greater knowledge of the Bible than he had. As a result of the discussion the host was very encouraged and has made progress since then to the point of dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of telling relatives about the truth was recently stressed by a circuit servant in an area where persons are employed far from their native villages and towns. A newly baptized brother immediately began to apply this counsel by writing letters to various members of his family, telling them he had found the true religion. At the next visit of the circuit servant the brother showed the results of the regular correspondence he had held with members of his family during the last four months. One of the letters from his father read: “I have read your letter carefully and read all the scriptures and found that what you say is true.” His brother wrote: “Find a place in the school there; I want to come and join your church.” However, this was not necessary, as the brother went home to help his parents and brother. As a result of his loving concern for his family and strengthened by the counsel he received from God’s Word, all the family made good progress in their study together and now they are all dedicated publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ZANZIBAR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;319,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Considerable interest was manifest in the truth in the opening months of the service year, with a peak of nine Bible studies being conducted with interested persons in November. However, by late December rebellion brewed in the island, and, as a result, the family who had gone there to serve where the need is great nearly two years before had to leave their fruitful assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;27,148,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,538 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,902</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work continues to make rapid advancement in Korea. Jehovah’s witnesses were happy to learn that at the close of the service year a contract was signed for the construction of a new addition to the branch office that will triple the space available for carrying on the Kingdom work. This new building will include a fine Kingdom Hall and will be used by two of the twenty-nine Seoul congregations. The brothers are preaching the Word faithfully and boldly throughout the land, but they do meet considerable opposition, and pressure is brought upon many because they forsake ancestor worship. But through endurance a wonderful witness is given. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A handful of brothers may have occasional access to an automobile, but at this writing there is not one brother in Korea known to have an automobile for his own use in the service. To care for sheeplike persons living far away sometimes requires much time and personal effort. A sister in Chon An walked seventeen miles regularly to care for a lady in a mountain village. The village elder opposed the conducting of the Bible study in the village on the ground that it would disturb the established customs of ancestor worship. But the sister’s kindness and love prevailed. Not being able to deny her faithfulness in walking so far to serve them and having interest in prophecy, the village elder himself became interested and arranged for a villagewide study. Both he and the interested lady are now publishers in the isolated group that has developed in the village. It has not been easy for this sister with a household of her own to take two days a week to make the trip to care for the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sons are considered the best insurance for one’s old age. When high school graduation time comes, Christian parents encourage their children toward a career in the full-time service, even if that may mean a sacrifice in material security. A brother in Sokcho, deformed and blind, has made sure that he planted the desire for full-time service in his children. Instead of asking his eldest son to support him when he graduated, he encouraged him to become a pioneer despite the relatives’ objections. The blind father reports how happy he is that his son is a pioneer. He set the proper example himself by vacation pioneering in the coldest month, January, and the warmest, August, when his children were on school vacation and could lead him to the territory. He writes that the spiritual well-being of his children is more important to him than the material security they can offer him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Patience in calling back brings happy results. A lady had been a Catholic for eight years when a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font4">book was placed with her. But she was cold on return visits after priestly interference. The special pioneer brother kept calling and would ask her to bring out her Catholic Bible to show her key scriptures. When she began to soften, a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet was arranged, and soon she was sharing in the field service. Her husband, a police official, beat her and tore up her Bibles and literature, but she did not weaken. Each morning she discussed the day’s text with her children in the hearing of her husband. He was moved by his wife’s steadfastness and now he too has become interested and has opened his home for a service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Letters are written by the infirm as a means to share in the witness work, but sometimes it is due to compassion for someone sighing and groaning over the wickedness of the old world. A sister in Hampyung read a story in the newspaper of a man who was reported as saying he would rather stay up on his little farm in the mountains, as it was paradise to him compared with the towns and cities where no love or kindness was to be found. She sent him a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font4"> booklet and explained how his hope for a paradise would be fulfilled after Armageddon. Three months later a reply came thanking her for leading him to have such a hope. After receiving the letter he had looked up Jehovah’s witnesses in his own area and had begun to study the Bible with them.

<p><span class="font5">For years now the Society has had to put up a hard legal fight for the rights of Jehovah’s witnesses to worship God freely in Lebanon. This year the efforts of those opposing the “everlasting good news” were climaxed with a resolution addressed to all Arabic States made by the Boycott Office against Israel, recommending the closing down of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in all Arab States. This was based on the false accusation that our work is pro-Zionist. The Society made an emphatic denial and protest, even sending two brothers to present this personally to the delegates of the Boycott Office gathered in Algeria in the month of June for their annual meeting. Since then more difficulties have been faced in Lebanon, especially when Security informed the branch office that the residence permits of all foreign missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses would not be renewed. Despite all these difficulties, the brothers in Lebanon, “filled with the holy spirit, . . . were speaking the word of God with boldness” all during this service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A French lady who came to Lebanon a few years ago to work as a governess was contacted by a publisher in the house-to-house work. She told the publisher that she did not believe in God. After moving to another section of the city, there for a second time the same publisher contacted her. Her first words were, “You again?” but this time out of courtesy she allowed the sister to come in. From then on the sister called on her regularly and finally a study was started. Outstanding in this woman was her sad look and lack of happiness. Why? Well, she will tell us: “On January 12, 1943, I was imprisoned by the Germans and sent to the famous concentration camp at Dachau. The time I spent there was so terrible that I don’t even like to speak about it. By the time the war was over I had lost all my family. From the camp only myself and one of my brothers survived. My sister and her family all died in her house during the bombings. Then my husband and small son were killed in an accident. By this time, after so much trouble and suffering, I lost all my faith in God and I was most unhappy. There is only one thing about the camp that I will always remember and that is the many Witnesses I met there who always had a smile on their faces. For a short time a young Czechoslovakian Witness shared the same cell with me. She spoke to me a lot and I was impressed by her faith, but at that time there were many things I could not understand. Hitler was determined to kill all of them and he used to call them swine. Many of them died, but with a smile on their lips. In Lebanon twenty years later I again came in contact with the Witnesses, but this time I have understood the truth. How thankful I am to Jehovah God and all my brothers for their good instruction in showing me the right way to worship Jehovah!” This new sister got baptized last June at our circuit assembly, and now you should see how the smile of happiness has put away the look of sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” as Jesus said. And this is what our new sister, mentioned in the previous experience, has found by helping another woman to come to a knowledge of the truth after being in bondage to “Babylon the Great” for more than thirty years as a nun. This woman was also a governess at the time she was contacted by our new sister. But how did she become a governess after having been a nun? Here is her story: “When I was a young girl thirteen years old I began to think that the way to serve God was by becoming a nun. When I reached the age of twenty-one I was accepted in a Carmelite convent in France. I was filled with hopes and aspirations as I thought that at last I was dedicated to the exclusive service of God. However, as the years passed, my aspirations fell. I found the other nuns jealous and suspicious and the whole life of the convent becoming intolerable. Then I began thinking about getting released and wrote to the Mother Superior asking to be freed from my vows. Instead of being freed, I found myself being sent to a lonely convent in Haifa, Palestine, during the years of World War II. Through the years I had written many letters to different superiors requesting release, but most of the letters never reached the proper church authorities and so were never acted upon. So I found myself moved from Palestine to France and then back to the Middle East in an almost seemingly hopeless situation. So it was while I was in Beirut, Lebanon, that steps toward my release started moving, and the papers were sent from the Vatican, which I signed, releasing me from my vows and setting me free after thirty years as a nun! After three years in Beirut I was contacted by a Witness who had just recently learned the truth too. At first I was doubtful and skeptical, thinking it was just another sect of Protestantism, but the light of the truth was enough to let me see at last that this was the truth. I was very happy; I liked the studies that were started with me so much. The truth was so reasonable, so right. Now I am in a new life full of hope and full of happiness, for which I praise God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The only publisher serving in Bahrain Islands left the country and returned to England, her homeland, due to the transfer of her husband’s secular work. There are just a few interested persons with whom the Society’s office still corresponds, but there is no one at the present time in the islands that can give them personal assistance. It is evident that Bahrain Islands is a place where the need is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Last year in July a publisher in the Tehran congregation contacted an Assyrian family in her ministry from house to house. The only son of the family showed good interest in the sermon, so the publisher applied the suggestion given in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> and, after making the placement, started a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book on the first call. A regular study was accepted by this young man. But soon a problem arose when his interest was directed to the organization and he was invited to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, since Sunday is a regular working day and his place of work was about sixty miles outside the city. Still his progress in the truth and appreciation of it made him realize the need for meeting attendance for further progress. So, despite his work, he made definite arrangements to attend the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study regularly on Sundays. Then he also started coming on Thursdays, and soon he was enrolled in the theocratic ministry school and was making progress in his speech assignments. Now he regularly shares in the proclamation of the good news, and how great was the joy of the congregation to see him standing up among the group of three who got baptized at the small circuit assembly that the congregation had last July! All this took place in less than a year. The importance of directing interest to the organization and following the suggestions of the Society given in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, Ministry</span><span class="font4"> are well illustrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAQ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,263,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Our sister in Iraq has now left the country with her family to establish herself in England. She has been faithfully serving in Iraq since the time she learned the truth, although she had no association with Jehovah’s people from the time the missionaries were deported from the country in 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are just a few interested persons left in this vast country without anyone to give them personal attention. We hope that Jehovah in due time will send willing brothers who may open this field where the need is great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The small congregation in Kuwait has gone through many difficulties in the last two years due to the suppression of religious freedom on the part of the local authorities against our brothers. The government made an internal decree banning the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">magazines. Since then many of the magazines sent through the mail have been confiscated. The government made a circular and sent it to some of the subscribers informing them that these are banned magazines because of being pro-Zionist. The Society made a strong protest to the government by correspondence, showing the falsity of such a charge, but with no results up to the present time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of this service year the only publisher in Qatar moved to India. While in Qatar he sowed many seeds of truth as he met interested persons. There are many persons who have the publications of the Society and a few still receive the magazines by mail. The Society’s office in Beirut keeps in contact with a few of these by correspondence. Our prayers go to the “Master of the harvest to send out workers” into this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,067,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">On October 12, 1963, five brothers and two sisters were taken before the military court and sentenced respectively to from six to thirteen months in prison. The brothers were taken immediately to prison while the two sisters were left free. They were sentenced on the false charge of forming </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> secret society. While in prison the brothers took advantage of every opportunity to speak “the word of God with boldness.” One of the ways they used to give a witness even to those who were guarding them in prison was by writing letters. It is the regulation of the prison that any letter written by a prisoner should be censored by the guard on duty. So the brothers wrote letters to their families and relatives in which they gave them encouragement by explaining that the things that were happening to them were prophesied in the Scriptures. So they would find a way to include a full house-to-house sermon that they had learned from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font4"> Every now and then the brothers would have a letter finished and would give it to the guard to be censored. This opened up many opportunities for them to give a witness, since the guards showed surprise to read such information in a letter of a prisoner, and they asked questions that were answered directly from the Bible. The guards were changed every two hours, so many were the guards who had the opportunity to receive a sermon through these letters. Some of the guards would tell the brothers: “We know you are good people so there is no need to read your letters.” But the brothers would answer: “Oh, no, we want you to read our letters as you do for everyone else, as we have nothing to hide.” Due to this witness many of the guards said: “You really are unjustly oppressed!” While in prison these brothers literally put in the time of a pioneer, since each one put in more than a hundred hours a month. Some of them tasted the joy of pioneer service for the first time while in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The families of these brothers came to a total of nineteen children and three wives who were left without any material support. But their trust in Jehovah made them see the words of David fulfilled in them when he said: “I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” Nearby congregations immediately made arrangements to support these brothers’ families materially, and they saw all their material needs satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How great was the joy of the brothers in Syria when, after much effort in presenting a protest to the government for such an unjust suppression of religious freedom, they saw Jehovah’s blessing on their efforts! After just two months the government issued an order totally revoking this unjust judgment and ordered the brothers to be set free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The witnesses of Jehovah in the Leeward Islands take their preaching commission seriously and continue steadily and patiently declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. The inhabitants of these islands are well acquainted with the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the clergy use every persuasion possible to have their parishioners close their ears to what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say. This is not a discouragement to real Christians because they know that Jehovah has declared that the good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the world and the part of the world assigned to them is the Leeward Islands. Some interesting experiences have been received from the branch and they are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A dear sister seventy-five years of age living in an isolated area in Antigua has been so zealous in supporting midweek field service arranged by the special pioneer that this pioneer was compelled to remark: “This sister is a great encouragement to me. She is always ready for midweek service and she walks two miles to our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies.” The brothers and other interested persons are strengthened by the way she uses her life to praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assistance arrangement has helped many to increase their praise. One sister whose main ministry was that of placing magazines was given assistance by a more mature sister. In a short time she was engaging in all features of the service, including the Bible study work. She climaxed the service year by vacation pioneering in the month of August, during which time she placed 13 books and 101 magazines, made 40 back-calls and conducted four Bible studies. These are the results when those ‘who are strong bear the weaknesses of those not strong.’—Rom. 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A teen-age publisher, after vacation pioneering, expressed her appreciation for the privilege this way: “Vacation pioneering has strengthened my ministry. Before I vacation pioneered I could give the sermon quite well at the doors, but while pioneering I gave it so many times to so many different kinds of people that now I am able to do it much better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGUILLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,810</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The clergy have put forth great effort to discourage their parishioners from reading the Bible aids used by Jehovah’s witnesses. However, this has not discouraged the publishers associated with the one congregation on this island. After hearing a fine sermon explaining what hell is according to the Scriptures, a young man remarked: “Now I know why the many religions are against you people; it is because Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63,609</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While enjoying a month of vacation pioneering one sister called at a crowded shop where she met the local Methodist preacher. Through her preaching activities she is well known in the community. Knowing that she was not able to read, those in the shop tried to confuse her with many difficult questions, but their efforts soon collapsed as question after question was answered truthfully and with patience. Finally the tables were turned when Christendom’s pet doctrine, the Trinity, came up. Her Bible answers not only opened the eyes of honest ones present but forced the preacher to abandon the group, clothed with the ridicule and confusion he wished for the sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An ailing sister had long cherished the idea of pioneering but was of the opinion that she would not be able to meet the requirements. However, the Society’s letters on pioneering and encouragement from different ones as well as the fine experiences and happy spirit of the pioneers kept the idea burning within her. One day the circuit servant said to her: “You can only know that you can’t pioneer if you try it.” Her joy was unspeakable when she finally made it. Said she: “Not only was I able to vacation pioneer, but I was better able to cope with my family duties because I had a schedule.” At a recent circuit assembly tears of joy came to her eyes as she told those present just how long she had wanted to pioneer and how much she had enjoyed it. She will try it again, she said, and her recommendation to both young and old is pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MONTSERRAT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13,430</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A priest visited the husband of a lady who had shown some interest in Bible discussions, telling him not to welcome Jehovah’s witnesses into his home. On his being asked why, no satisfactory answer was offered. The husband decided to find out more about Jehovah’s witnesses for himself. When the special pioneer called at his home, the man asked many questions. When told that true religion can be identified by unity of doctrine and teaching, he replied that discord was evident in every religion and he thought this must be the case among Jehovah’s witnesses too. So the pioneer explained that he could prove Jehovah’s witnesses right by speaking to other Witnesses and asking them the same questions. As the special pioneer was leaving the home his partner came along and was invited in. A discussion on how to identify true religion was pursued while the first pioneer remained silent. The man readily acknowledged that both Witnesses spoke in agreement and called this to the attention of his wife and others present, saying: “This must be the true religion.” A regular study is being conducted with this family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Getting to assemblies sometimes requires great determination, as was seen in the case of one of our sisters who is a schoolteacher. She had applied for permission to leave the island to attend the “Fruitage of the Spirit” district assembly in Antigua. Permission was not given due to a teachers’ seminar that would not conclude until the Friday of the same week. Our sister showed her determination by getting her things packed and arranging for taxi service to the airport, although she had been warned that her leaving might cause her to lose her position. It was only one hour before her departure time that the letter of permission was handed to her. How thankful this sister was for having shown courage and determination to be present!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEVIS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,770</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Giving praise to the Creator is the objective of the brothers in Nevis, and they have increased in this despite clergy opposition. In May of this year there was a circuit assembly on the island, and the attendance of 175 indicated that there are many persons who like to hear about God’s kingdom. One person remarked to an assembly delegate: “You are the sixth Witness that has called on me this week and I find every one of you nice people.” Good cooperation was shown by government officials, granting us the use of the pavilion, authorizing the providing of lights, water and other facilities that made our assembly comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two congregations appreciate the help provided by the five special pioneers on this island. One of them started to pioneer in 1950 and now, at the age of seventy-six, is still able to climb the many hills in his territory to reach the homes with the Kingdom message. He continues to be an inspiration to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. EESTATIUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,016</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The sister who is alone in letting the light of the Kingdom shine forth on this island has shown courage and has continued regularly to do what she can in helping others set their hope on life in Jehovah’s new order. The regular visits of the circuit servant and his wife are a great encouragement to this sister. They always report a very happy week of service together when they visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. KITTS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38,113</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">More and more praise is being given to Jehovah by those who are serving Him on this island. In 1959 a special pioneer and his wife were assigned to an isolated area and by systematic effort their labor has resulted in a congregation of sixteen active Kingdom praisers who, this service year, averaged fourteen hours each month in the preaching activity. Many from this congregation have enjoyed the privilege of vacation pioneering. In August one young brother extended his vacation pioneering to become a regular pioneer, and he is the second regular pioneer that this congregation has produced in this service year. There is a good spirit shown by the brothers in the three congregations and one isolated group on this island, and that they have a love for the preaching work can be seen by the fact that they averaged over eleven hours monthly during the year in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. MARTIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,002</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">One of the big events of the year was the dedication of a new Kingdom Hall on the French side of the island. The brothers rejoiced to see 185 in attendance for the dedication program. One of the first brothers to get the truth in St. Martin gave a brief history of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. He said it was in 1952 that the missionary boat “Faith” stopped there, public meetings were held and many attended and had studies in the Bible. But only two at that time made a dedication. These two have remained strong ever since and have been joined by many others, until today there are two congregations and a peak of forty-six reporting. On the weekend following the dedication of the new Kingdom Hall a circuit assembly was held. To accommodate the number expected, the Society’s new film was projected on the outside of the Kingdom Hall. Under a starry sky an audience of 313 attentively observed how urgent it is to get out of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ione publisher on the island of Saba has continued to demonstrate his faith by sharing regularly each month in the preaching work. It has not been possible for this brother to attend any assemblies as yet, but he is visited by the circuit servant. In a recent letter to the branch office he said: “I am alone on this island of Saba, but still I feel it is my duty to tell the people about the good news since Jesus said that it must be preached to people of all nations, so that would include here too.” He looks forward to the time when he can meet the brothers at assemblies on neighboring islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Following the interview that Brother Henschel and a committee of brothers had with President Tubman of Liberia in December, resulting in the Government’s order that Jehovah’s witnesses were not to be molested, as reported on in the February 8 issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font5"> the work of restoration began. Every congregation and group were immediately visited by the returned branch servant and his assistant to encourage all to support regular study and service arrangements. The brothers happily responded to the opportunity to preach again openly. Jehovah had vindicated them as sincere Christians and removed the stigma of subversion that had been wrongly applied to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within a short time six of the expelled missionaries were back in the country. Meetings were being well attended and the number of home Bible studies increased sharply. A national assembly was announced, but where would it be held? Jehovah was pleased to have it located at the new City Hall theater, one of the finest buildings in Monrovia and just a short distance from the presidential mansion. What a contrast with what was going on just a year before when Jehovah’s people were experiencing three sleepless days and nights in an open field with beatings by soldiers and the plundering of their possessions! Imagine the happiness of the integrity keepers now assembled amid velvet drapes in luxuriously cushioned comfort and in complete peace! No bayonet-toting soldiers appeared. Jehovah had dignified and exalted his faithful servants. The public talk attendance was 520, just twice the number of publishers reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attitude of some regarding us has changed considerably. This report was received from a circuit servant toward the end of the year: “In the barracks of Gbarnga where we were brutalized last year, much interest is shown among the soldiers and their wives. So we have suggested that a book study be conducted there for their benefit rather than to make 20 to 25 back-calls every Sunday afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One young sister at school spoke “the word of God with boldness” in defending her beliefs before a science teacher who belittled the Bible. This caused another teacher who was listening to change his mind about Jehovah’s witnesses and later he addressed the entire student body on the subject of “those persecuted for righteousness’ sake.” Referring to the sister, he said: “If you really believe the Bible, which one of you can stand and firmly defend his religion as did one girl yesterday? I really admire her. Though this girl was speaking to an authority who could punish her, yet she, with boldness and fearlessness, defended her religion to the very last and proved the Bible to be an inspired book of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I will never change my way, so don’t preach to me,” declared one man who took the lead in worshiping idols. Nevertheless, a special pioneer continued to talk to the man on many occasions. During the visit of the circuit servant, this man astonished everyone by taking all his idols and, in the presence of the brothers, throwing them into the river. From now on, he said, he would serve Jehovah and not idols. The next day he preached to other idol worshipers who also agreed to serve Jehovah, explaining that they have realized nothing for serving idols during the past years of their lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Steadily over the years there has been an ingathering of the “other sheep’’ into the congregations formed in Luxembourg. In this small country in the central part of Europe the congregation publishers averaged a monthly distribution of 14.3 magazines each, the pioneers 108.6 and the special pioneers 135.7, during the past year. It is evident that the publishers have been magazine-minded and they also engage regularly in all other activities of Kingdom publishers, including back-calls, Bible studies and public meeting activity. The population of Luxembourg knows about Jehovah’s witnesses, as these experiences sent in by the branch office show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One couple came in contact with the truth around thirty-five years ago, but never took it seriously enough to make a dedication to serve Jehovah. From time to time they were called on and given the latest literature. During the past few years first a brother called on them, then two pioneer sisters would bring the latest issues of the magazines to “bother their conscience,” as the man put it, and finally </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> special pioneer couple started a study with them. Still the decision was a difficult one. There were the clubs, and one thing in particular stood in the way. “I’ll never go from house to house,” said the man. From the Munich assembly the special pioneers sent a program and reports. When they returned they noted a wonderful change. The man quit his clubs, and both began attending all the meetings. Soon they made their important decision. After some thirty years of contact with the truth and seven months of systematic study, this couple symbolized their dedication. Since then seldom does a day go by without both taking part in some field service. Last April the man reached a personal goal of fifty hours in the service. The pioneer still remembers well when this new brother said: “Oh, what tremendous patience Jehovah had with us!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This couple soon had the pleasure of enjoying some “harvesting” in Jehovah’s “field” of service, and saw how the truth in a small tract can help bring families together. Having received a tract, one of their neighbor ladies came to them for more information. Almost immediately a study was arranged with the woman, her husband and child. Soon they too were attending the meetings and wanted to witness to their newfound faith. Due to ill feelings some relatives had not visited this family for fourteen years. They were witnessed to in a letter, and imagine their surprise when they were immediately invited to come and pay their relatives a visit, and the great joy of all to find that this family too was studying, and that a nephew is a pioneer!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The large island off the eastern coast of Africa, now called the Malagasy Republic, is receiving a good witness by Jehovah’s witnesses. The Society opened a new branch office there this year so that closer supervision of the preaching activity might be given, and in order that the publishers of the Kingdom might be helped more in their theocratic activity. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine in printed form was released in the Malagasy language in September, and three months later they had their first book in Malagasy, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font5"> All of this proved to be a rich blessing to the publishers of God’s kingdom and gave them real incentive to go to the people with the literature in the language they read. Here are a few experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When there is the desire to serve Jehovah in the pioneer service, for some even a large family is not a hindrance. One couple with ten children, six still living at home with ages ranging from eleven to nineteen years, was invited by the Society to take up the special pioneer work. The brother, a tailor, left his work, and the two zealously started in the special pioneer service. Their zeal gave much encouragement to their children, and all except the youngest who is not yet baptized have been vacation pioneers, two of them several times. This special pioneer couple are an example to their brothers in their zeal, and even though living a long distance from the Kingdom Hall and many times having to walk, they are always at the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The words of Jesus in Mark 10:29, 30 show that we would never lack brothers or sisters, and the following experience of a missionary shows this to be true. She writes: “When I left my home to come to the Malagasy Republic I left my family and my brothers and sisters in the truth. Would I find more in my new assignment? Yes, I soon had many new brothers and sisters. After two and a half years the Society sent my husband and me to a new city where there were not yet any Witnesses. I cried when I left because of having to leave my brothers and sisters, but I felt sure that I would soon have more in our new assignment and, sure enough, we began to become part of a large family here in our new assignment. In attending the ‘Fruitage of the Spirit’ district assembly five years later, we brought with us forty-seven brothers, sisters and friends. Seven of these were baptized at the assembly. What a joy this was for me, and I know that no matter where I am in the New World society I will always have brothers and sisters, as Jesus promised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up till the present time only 6 percent of the population in the Malagasy Republic has been reached with the good news. An effort has recently been made to witness to some of the nearby unassigned territories. In one congregation a trip was arranged on Sunday with a bus rented to take the group to the territory. Over 50 percent of the publishers participated. By leaving at 6:45 in the morning, working all day in the territory, having the study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> together and returning at 7 p.m., they were able to leave much literature. Meeting many poor, humble people, they exchanged literature for corn, rice and even a chicken and a rabbit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Malawi went through severe testing during the past year because they refused to take part in political activities. A wave of persecution was brought to bear against them. Ninety-seven Kingdom Halls and more than one thousand homes of Jehovah’s witnesses were destroyed. The crops of hundreds of gardens were uprooted and destroyed and many of the brothers and sisters were assaulted and some killed. Still they put true worship of Jehovah God first as they continued to seek God’s kingdom and its righteousness. Many people in Malawi have come to appreciate the firm stand that Jehovah’s witnesses took in remaining neutral during the political upheavals. It is good to report that at the end of the year Jehovah’s witnesses are enjoying peace and quiet once again and are able to preach and assemble together freely. Here are some experiences from the branch servant who looks after Malawi and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How grateful the brothers were for the loving-kindness shown by their brothers in other parts! Many gifts of clothing, food and blankets were received. Typical of the many letters of thanks received by the branch office is this one: “I have written this letter to express my thanks for what I have received from the Society, clothes and a blanket, which I did not expect to have. Thank you very much through Jehovah our God; let Jehovah be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How important it is that we not only have knowledge of the truth but also deeply love that which we do know! During the troubles, two sisters with three-week-old babies in their arms had to flee from their homes during the night because of persecution, which had become very violent. One of the sisters had just been divorced by her husband because she had refused to do what he himself had done, that is, to renounce her faith. He was literate, but she was illiterate. Yet her faith was strong and her love of what she knew was great, even though her knowledge was limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brothers have not let a love of material things hold them back from making a firm stand for the truth. One brother was threatened by hooligans and was told that if he did not join with them in their political activities, then his house would be destroyed together with his fields of sweet potatoes, cassava and maize. He refused to compromise, and said that it was up to them what they did and that these material things meant nothing to him compared with the truth, even though they were all his worldly possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Approaching people when doing street magazine work is an effective way of giving a witness. As the circuit servant explained to one congregation he was serving, brothers should not stand looking like “signposts,” but should try to approach people. One African sister was happy due to applying this admonition. She approached the local pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who was just about to get on his bicycle to leave for a church meeting. He quietly listened to the brief sermon. Then he said: “There is no congregation as courageous as you Jehovah’s witnesses. I thought that you would be afraid to talk to me. Let me have one of those magazines so that I may see what makes you so courageous.” So a magazine was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just before going to press good news was received that the government of Malawi was taking action against the murderers of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is hoped now that peaceful times will return to the ministers of God so that they can continue to help people to understand God’s Word. This report appeared in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Glasgow Herald</span><span class="font4"> (Scotland) on Thursday, October 29, 1964:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">EIGHT SENTENCED TO DEATH Murder of Jehovah’s Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BLANTYRE, Malawi. Wednesday.—Eight men, including three officials of the Malawi Congress Party, were sentenced to death by the High Court this week for the murder of a Jehovah’s Witness who refused to register for the General Elections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Elton Barnett Mwachande was “cut down and killed,” the evidence showed, at Mlanje last February when Jehovah’s Witnesses fled from men who were burning houses of people who refused to register. —Reuter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOZAMBIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 6,650,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Taking the opportunity to give a witness at every occasion results in many rich blessings. The circuit servant’s wife was given the name and address of an interested person for her to contact. Accompanied by a new publisher who had only studied six weeks with brothers in Portugal before coming to Mozambique, she came to the apartment door of a person who had the same name as that of the interested person. When the circuit servant’s wife found that this was not the person she was looking for, she took the opportunity to give a witness. The lady invited her neighbors to listen as well. Literature was placed with all three, and the following day a Bible study was started. One of the neighbors was moving to another town and she was very anxious to have someone call on her there. So her name and address were sent to the local overseer, and a study was started with her there. The circuit servant’s wife and the new publisher continued searching for the original interested person. When she was contacted, she was found to be eagerly seeking the truth, and a study was started with her. So out of one back-call slip, three studies resulted, and how happy this new publisher is as she strives for greater maturity, for now she is busy conducting two of the studies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Are the field service goals set by the Society unreasonable? No, they can be easily reached even by the newest of publishers. A special pioneer invited a couple to share in the service. The wife was eager to have as much of a share as possible and during her first month of service she accompanied the special pioneer sister three times each week. By the end of the first month she was able to give first-call and back-call sermons and understood how to conduct a Bible study. She thought that the field service goals were very reasonable and even though her second month of service was April, she enthusiastically reached out to meet the special magazine goal of thirty for each publisher. The result of that month’s service was that she was able to report over thirty hours, with thirty-five magazines placed and with six back-calls made and one home Bible study conducted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This young nation is going through all the troubles that new nations go through to get organized. In former </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font5"> the territory was listed under Singapore and included Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak. But now Malaysia includes all of this territory, and Jehovah’s witnesses are faithfully pressing on here, speaking the word of God with boldness. While people of this newborn country are worried about its troubles and reorganization, Jehovah’s witnesses are busy preaching the “everlasting good news,” which is the only hope for mankind. They know that they have to preach the word in favorable season and unfavorable. (2 Tim. 4:2) Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would seem difficult to reach your service goals when one week of the month is placed under a curfew, and all people must stay indoors. But the zeal of our brothers did not permit that to interfere with their regularity of service. They wrote many letters and used various means to keep on comforting the people. How grateful these people were to be comforted in time of distress! One special pioneer received a grateful reply from a subscriber who wrote: “Thanks a million for your letter of encouragement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Often the question is asked: “The person with whom I studs' the Bible is not interested. Shall I drop the study?” Well, let us answer it with an experience. About two years ago a special pioneer sister had a study with a girl who had some knowledge of the truth. But she found this young girl indifferent and with no interest in the truth. This girl agreed to study because she had some time to spare and because the other family members were also studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Instead of dropping the study, the sister patiently analyzed it and found what the problem really was—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">lack of appreciation, as she just took the truth for granted. This sister then worked on the problem. After discussing a Bible principle she would ask: “When we are faced with this problem, wouldn’t we be lost if the Bible did not provide us the way out? or ... if Jehovah’s organization did not explain the solution to us?” Questions of this nature worked as they helped to build up appreciation. For a time the girl was irregular at the meetings, but gradually, as her appreciation increased, she came more regularly. She used to share in the field service occasionally, but soon her service hours increased. When she appreciated the need to symbolize her dedication by water immersion, she was baptized. Since then she has never taken the truth for granted. She appreciates it so much that she became a vacation pioneer during her school vacation. All this happy progress came about because the special pioneer analyzed the problem and persistently worked to overcome it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses wherever you are, especially at your place of employment? If you do, perhaps you have enjoyed blessings similar to those of this publisher who writes: “Although my secular employment takes me to an isolated place far away from my congregation, I have not failed to identify myself to my colleagues as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They were impressed by the way I conducted myself and wanted to know more about my religion. This gave me the opportunity to suggest a group study, which suggestion was readily accepted, and a study was started. How happy I was to see them put into practice what they learned! For example, when they learned that blood was sacred, they immediately stopped eating it. When I told them the importance of attending meetings, three of them came to the public talk at the last assembly. One of them kept on coming and even started out in the field service. This was especially gratifying to see because she had to travel more than forty miles each time to attend the congregation meetings. She is now a regular publisher and has just traveled 250 miles to attend the ‘Fruitage of the Spirit’ Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAURITIUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;722,089</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There are three islands in the Indian Ocean that make up the territory for the Branch established in Mauritius. It is interesting how work gets started on different islands and how people accept the truth. Everything has small beginnings, and when one 'Witness lands on an island he just begins talking and it is not long before Bible studies are started, then congregations. So it goes in the In<a name="bookmark168"></a><a name="bookmark169"></a>dian Ocean in the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues. Here are some interesting reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the start of the service year the service center at St. Pierre consisted of two pioneers and three publishers. During December ten brothers took up the vacation pioneer work, and it was decided to have some of them work in St. Pierre to help the group. The increase in activity immediately brought opposition from the Catholic priest. One of the sisters writes that while working from door to door, “a Catholic priest came upon me like a raging lion, knelt down before me and with arms stretched out cried out, ‘I beg you, Miss, to leave this place; stop troubling my flock; please go!’” Calmly she explained her work and tried to show him how bur magazines quote from the Bible, but he grabbed two of them from her hand and tore them up. By this time a large crowd had gathered, and the sister told him he would do well to think of what the crowd would think of him, as she was sure that none of them would think of doing such a thing. Pie also grabbed two magazines from an interested person and tore them in four and threw them on a fire that was burning by the roadside. As it had been planned to cover the territory during the month, over twenty pioneers and publishers were working in the area the next week. Again the priest came and started acting in the same obnoxious way and ended up by pushing one of the brothers into a bamboo hedge. At this the police were called and one of them told the brothers that they can expect this kind of persecution when they follow in the footsteps of Jesus. A statement was made at the police station and the priest was given a severe warning. Due to the publicity given our work by the priest, the attendance at the group study increased from ten to seventeen in the next three months, and now at the end of the service year there are ten publishers in this town and an application has been received for the Society to form a congregation in the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were pleased to baptize our oldest publisher during this year. He was contacted by a special pioneer while working from door to door. When the back-call •was made he told the pioneer: “I’ve been praying to God to send me one of his messengers of truth. I knew that truth must exist somewhere in the world and that our loving God could not possibly let me die before showing me his light of truth. Last week, in answer to my prayer, you called bringing the good news of his Kingdom.” He regularly attends all meetings and enjoys going out in service even though he is a little deaf. After his dedication and baptism he said: “I’m eighty years old and yet never in my life have I felt so young and happy!” No one is too old to learn the truth and do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REUNION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;368,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 161 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,286</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In only three years the ratio of publishers to population has dropped from 1 to 41,667 to 1 to 2,286. During the last service year fifty-seven persons were immersed. Here is an example of how it happened. In January 1964 a shoemaker was visited for the first time by one of Jehovah’s witnesses. With great interest he started to study, and all his family, his wife and six children, joined in the study with him. Great patience was needed by the publisher to overcome the many objections and questions raised. However, consider the fruitage: Seven months later a new service center was formed at the home of this family. There is a regular attendance of some twenty persons, most of whom have learned the truth through the zeal of this family. The husband, being well known in the neighborhood because of his work, takes every opportunity to talk about the truth, and his wife and two of his children are also publishers. All four were baptized at the circuit assembly held in August, and so were some of those who had become interested because of this family’s preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first assembly held on the island was an experience in how Jehovah provides for his servants. After months of trying to secure a hall, without success, a restaurant was found that would hold about 250 persons. The only difficulty was that it would cost 45,000 CFA ($184) for three days. The brothers were advised of the need, and, even before the assembly started, the cost of the hall was covered by their voluntary contributions. A kindly disposed person even contributed a loudspeaker system. At the end of the assembly there was a small credit balance, which will enable the brothers to buy a little equipment for the cafeteria. For the first day 168 were present and on Sunday 230 heard the public talk. There &quot;were twenty-one immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RODRIGUES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,800</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Rodrigues is a small island only nine miles by four situated 350 miles east of Mauritius. Its only contacts with the outside world are the cable and wireless station and a boat that sails from Mauritius every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In January a sister went to live on the island, as her husband’s secular work took him there. Since their arrival both the sister and her daughter have regularly reported service. For six weeks, starting in July, a special pioneer was sent to the island and he found much interest. He was able to start twelve studies, and says that many more could be started if someone were there permanently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Preaching the Word of God has a powerful effect on the minds of the people, especially when they have been held tightly within the world empire of false religion, Babylon the Great. Hearing the truth is different from reading it for yourself, and due to the fact that the Catholic Church has done little in teaching their people how to read and write, many coming to a knowledge of the truth are disappointed that they cannot read the Bible. However, Jehovah’s witnesses in Mexico have established reading classes where these are necessary. During the past year 199 such classes were arranged and 1,230 adult persons were taught to read and write. Now they can enjoy the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine and other Society publications, and, above all, they can enjoy reading the Bible and can go into the homes of people to teach the truth to those ‘having ears to hear.’ These good people have often been mobbed because of carrying on their ministerial work, and the Catholic priests are behind such actions. Here are some experiences from the Mexican branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To accomplish his own purpose Jehovah can and does frustrate his enemies. This he demonstrated at a circuit assembly in the State of Guerrero. The mayor was absent, and the other city authorities, being pressured by the priest, told the brothers they could not go from house to house in that town. Knowing the Witnesses’ determination, the priest got his mob ready Saturday morning in this town and waited for the brothers. Knowing they did not have any guarantee of protection, the brothers went to outlying villages to work. Finally, the mobsters discovered what had happened and rushed to these other places, only to find that the brothers had worked and gone. Then the priest organized his mobsters to go to these same outlying villages on Sunday, but on Saturday afternoon the mayor returned to town, visited the assembly and gave the brothers a guarantee of protection. So on Sunday morning the brothers all went from house to house in that same town while the mobsters awaited them in the outlying towns. When, finally, the mobsters discovered that the Witnesses were back in the original town, they returned, but too late, as the time for witnessing was over. They formed a large mob in the center of town, but the police quelled it. Many residents, seeing the savage action of the priest against these peaceful Christians, were disgusted and many attended the assembly. It was the largest ever held—1,068 in attendance! Several studies were arranged. Jehovah gave the victory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One zealous Catholic man received instructions from his priest to enter a circuit assembly and break it up. The man asked the priest: “Listen, Father, if we win, what will we say to them?” The priest answered: “You just win, that’s all, ha, ha, ha.” This honest Catholic man began to see the motive of the priest and he entered, not to break up the meeting, but to listen, and left with a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription and with arrangements for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> back-call, which resulted in a regular study. Now this man is a baptized publisher and his wife is studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A bold witness brought Jehovah’s blessing in Chiapas, where some fanatic Catholics asked their priest what they could do to do away with those “protestants” (Jehovah’s witnesses). The priest really thought they meant Protestants so he told them to arrange a public square meeting. The meeting was arranged and at the hour designated five humble witnesses of Jehovah came and there were over 300 Catholics. The priest stated it was a shame that these persons were so wrong with the teachings of Luther, at which the Witnesses stated that they were not Protestants but Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest’s whole attitude changed, because he had had talks with Jehovah’s witnesses before and lost each time. Unable to refute the simple Bible doctrines, he went into a rage and left. The people saw they were deceived by their priest and began to ask many questions of the Witnesses. Many studies were arranged and 111 of the 300 inhabitants of this village attended the circuit servant’s talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Schoolchildren who are Witnesses have many fine opportunities to give a good witness to their faith. One such student relates how the priest came to bless all the students, but she refused his blessing. Upon seeing this, the teacher asked all that were not Catholics to stand up and, although there were several Protestants there, only she stood up. Afterward many fine discussions were had. A boy listened, attended the district assembly with all his family and is now a Witness. Asked why, he stated that it was the strong faith of this young sister in standing up against all the class, and he wanted that faith, which he did not have as a Protestant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 159 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 72,944</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some years now there has been an exodus from this land on the part of Europeans because it is difficult to get work. Ever since 1960 there has been a constant decrease in the number of publishers too. But now it seems that the turning point has come. Although there have always been many who were baptized each year, showing that they had dedicated their lives to Jehovah’s service, many of these have had to leave Morocco. But let the branch servant give us the report on the activity there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Morocco in reality has produced more than just a 2.2-percent increase in publishers. Many of the Bible studies that were started in Morocco have continued in the new countries where the people have taken up residence, and these students have shortly afterward become Jehovah’s witnesses. This can be seen by some of the letters the publishers get from those who have moved away. For instance, notice these few lines from a letter received by a missionary couple: “As for me, I’m very enthusiastic. The more I study the more marvelous the truth seems and more clear. I’m attending the public talks and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study on Sundays at the Kingdom Hall here in B---. I also go Thursday</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">night to the study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Babylon’</span><span class="font4"> book I bought from you. . . . I’m studying with a very nice Witness. ... I’d like to be baptized in May, but that might be too soon; I’ll see when the time draws near. I’m anxious to start witnessing for Jehovah and help in this wonderful work. I’m so glad you started me in this study. Remember how suspicious I was at first, and obstinate?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a missionary was assigned to help an isolated group, he decided to write to all the names in an old study file of people that lived in other towns. He got an answer from one man who seemed very happy to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses again. A study was started by mail. From the answers one could see the progress this person was making in spite of quite a few difficulties with his job and family opposition. On his vacation he and his family took a long trip to visit a family of Witnesses and remained with them for one week. He took advantage of this week to go out in the service every day. Once the sister suggested that, if he wanted to go to the movies with his wife, she would not mind baby-sitting for them. But his reply was: “I am not here to go to the movies, but to go in the service, because I want to learn how to serve our God.” During the week he seized the opportunity to be baptized. Now this brother has a regular study with his family, who were at one time opposed. He regularly sends in his report of nine or ten hours and six to nine back-calls and his study. He talks to everyone in the village about the truth and has obtained several subscriptions from those leaving to live in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NETHERLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,041,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 14,171 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 850</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work has moved ahead at a good pace in the Netherlands during the past year, and Jehovah’s witnesses have been happy in contributing their share to the great heap of witness given around the world. One of the outstanding things for the brothers in the Netherlands was that so many engaged in the vacation pioneer work for at least one month during the year. In April 374 joined in this special service, as against 164 during the previous year. They are happy to have put forth this extra effort in order to get a taste of the pioneer work. Here are a few experiences from the Netherlands branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How seed sown on the right kind of soil will grow! In this case the seed sown was contained in two magazines placed with a lady on Magazine Day by a special pioneer. When the pioneer came back to “water” this seed, the elderly mother of this lady said her daughter had to leave suddenly. She was curious to know how the pioneer sister knew her daughter. At first the pioneer was reluctant to tell her why she came, but she could not keep her motive hidden. When the elderly lady found out that the publisher was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, she was cold at first but soon became friendly. The pioneer noticed that the family Bible lay on the table, so she remarked she is always happy to speak to someone who has love for God’s Word. To this the elderly lady responded. The sister went on and soon was reading texts out of this lady’s own Bible about the blessings of a Paradise earth. This moved the elderly lady of seventy-seven years very much and she noted down some texts. The sister asked her if she had been built up by the discussion, in spite of the fact that she had discussed the Bible with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This woman said she was very much comforted, and arrangements were made for future calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Contact was broken for some time, as she moved to an old folks’ home run by the Reformed Church. When things settled down, a study was started and in a short time she was telling the truth to others in the home, which led to loss of friends and popularity. Slowly she broke loose from Babylon the Great. After a year and a half of study she got a tax form from her church and she used this occasion to revoke her membership in the Dutch Reformed Church. She has taken a firm stand for the truth and even had to come before the manager, but this did not shake her. She now has a Bible study of her own in the home and talks the truth to many others, and it will not be long until she will symbolize her dedication, although this will mean quite a strain on her old, frail body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The circuit servant started a study with an old man of eighty-one and his wife. A local publisher continued the study and soon these old folks could not wait a week till the next study and requested two studies a week. After one month of study they even attended some meetings. In time his daughter and son-in-law also began studying and are growing rapidly in the truth with this old couple. The man confided to the brother that in one year he had learned more from Jehovah’s witnesses than he had in the church in forty years. After a few studies on baptism this old man wanted to get baptized. In view of his age he did not want to wait, and it was decided to immerse him in the home of the brother who studied with him. Just before he was baptized, two of his sons paid him a visit and said: “Father, if you let yourself be baptized by Jehovah’s witnesses, we will never set foot in your house. We are finished.” The old man answered: “Dear boys, I love you and your wives and your children, but if you expect me to leave my God Jehovah in your favor, then do not ever come back; but as for me I will remain faithful to him and I am going to get baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole congregation was assembled in the home of the brother and there a talk was given, many songs were sung and, after all was over, this old man said: “This has been the most wonderful day in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NETHERLANDS ANTILLES (Curasao)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 220 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;132,055</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 600</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good progress was made in the islands of the Netherlands Antilles—Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire—during the past year. One of the year’s highlights was the dedication, in the month of December, of a new branch office that was built in Willemstad, Curasao. It is a practical building, well located in the city, from which place the work of Jehovah’s witnesses can easily be directed. It also has a very fine Kingdom Hall used by the local congregation. Here are some experiences sent in from the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young sister wrote an essay on a Scriptural theme. Her schoolmaster told her that he did not believe that she wrote the composition, since it treated such a deep subject so thoroughly. But after discussing the subject of creation with her, the teacher said that he did believe she wrote it, as she knew what she was talking about. Then he asked her how she knew so much about the Bible. When she told him that she is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he said: “That explains a lot.” She was able to give him an extended testimony about the Bible, our meetings and the activity of the theocratic organization. She invited him to the assembly and to see the new film. The schoolmaster told the publisher that he had strayed from the path of God but her composition and explanation were bringing him back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The really outstanding event of the year was the showing of the new film, “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World,” at our last circuit assembly. For the showing of the film we obtained the use of the Public Library building from the government. This place is well known by the public. It seats about 500 comfortably. With about 200 publishers expected for the assembly we figured that the library would be large enough for the film showing. Well, imagine our surprise and pleasure when 760 were packed in to see the film and about 100 latecomers were turned away because there was not even standing room anymore. It pays to be on time, you know. Now people are clamoring to have the film shown again, but we are waiting until the next circuit assembly. There was much comment about the film afterward. One Catholic priest said in church the very next morning that ‘there were 760 pagans at the public library to see a film last night.’ Either he or one of his right-hand men must have been there too. Others said that, if they had paid their money to travel around the world, they would not have seen all that they saw in the film, because they would not have known where to find those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Near the end of the service year two missionaries were involved in an auto accident in which a Dutch marine hit and killed a civilian and then hit the car of the missionaries and banged them up. After the accident one of the missionaries called on the wife of the dead man and read many scriptures from the Bible showing the condition and hope for the dead. Later a back-call was made and, although the lady was Catholic, she showed so much interest that a study was started with her by one of her neighbors who is a Witness. The lady began to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall almost at once and has not missed a meeting since. Now she is going in service and obtained a new subscription on her first day in field service. This lady knew about the truth before but never took it as seriously as she is doing now. She plans to travel to Aruba to attend the “Fruitage of the Spirit” district assembly. We thank Jehovah for the wonderful harvest we are enjoying in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ARUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59,657</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 135 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 442</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase in the work in Aruba has come almost entirely from among the natives. During the past year six young men have made their dedication and are zealously making progress in getting an accurate knowledge of the truth and imparting this to others. The fact that they took a stand for the truth in the face of opposition has been in itself a good testimony to the truth. When one of these young men first became interested he brought home a Bible and some literature. While he was out, his mother tore up the Bible and Bible literature. When the son got home and found out what had happened, he retaliated by breaking up his mother’s images, his knowledge of the truth being limited at that time. The mother called the police, who came and made peace in the home by telling the mother to respect her son’s new religion and the son to respect his mother’s religion. On leaving, though, the policeman said to the mother: ‘You know the boy is right; the Bible says one should not worship images.’ The mother did not replace her images, and other members of the family are making progress in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magazine distribution has contributed greatly to the spiritual prosperity of Jehovah’s people in Aruba, as indicated by the comment of a priest in a local newspaper. His complaint is that when he goes to visit his people he finds them reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> instead of Catholic publications. Many people are getting wise to the fact that they do not need to feed on husks when there is an abundance of satisfying spiritual food to be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BONAIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,381</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 266</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The highlight of the year in Bonaire was the circuit assembly in May in which the new film, “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World,” was shown for the first time in the Netherlands Antilles. The assembly was held at the Kingdom Hall, which holds about fifty to sixty persons. We knew this place would be too small to show the film, so we showed it in the yard of the Kingdom Hall, which proved to be an ideal arrangement. Many persons who were too shy to enter the hall would stay outside in the dark and watch the film. With cinder blocks and lumber loaned to us by a friendly merchant near the hall, we were able to prepare nice benches to sit on for those watching the film. There were only twenty-eight publishers present for the little assembly, but 168 came to see the film. That was five interested persons for each publisher present, and those seeing the film liked it, as indicated by many favorable comments heard later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Bonaire the prospects for expansion are good. Jehovah’s witnesses are well known by all and well respected by many because of the good work accomplished by the missionaries and the good conduct of the faithful native publishers. For example, one brother received too much money in his pay envelope. He took the extra money back to the office, and that caused a lot of favorable comment. The clerks were saying: “How many people ever bring money back? It is only when their pay is short that they come back.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has never left his people with nothing to do. He has commissioned them to do work, and they are happy in their ministerial activity. In the northern territory of Newfoundland and Labrador the cold settles in early each winter and fog shrouds the land. Still, Jehovah’s witnesses do not treat their work lightly, but they take care of their stewardship. They keep in mind the admonition of Paul at 2 Timothy 4:5: “You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” Here is a report on some of the things that have occurred in that northern land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A sister relates the success she has had in letter writing. Last March an interested person wrote a letter to the branch office requesting a Bible and two Biblestudy aids. Since this lady lived in isolated territory, it was suggested that one of the sisters in the St. John’s congregation write her a letter, with the hope of establishing a study by correspondence. The sister wrote a letter and included in it the sermon on “Sincerity” and explained how she would be pleased to conduct a free correspondence course. The reply from this interested person was very encouraging indeed. It follows: “I received your most welcome letter and I’m glad to know that you are so concerned about the people of this world, as there are so many that do not know the Bible or the meaning of what it is all about. I want to really understand the answers to the big questions concerning my very existence that I have always wondered about. I know it is not enough to be sincere in religion. We must be full-grown Christians, able and willing to help others, to teach them what they should do and how, as shown in Matthew 28:20.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fully accomplishing our ministry may mean learning a new language. This is what some of the pioneer sisters did in Newfoundland, learning the sign language in order to witness to those who could not speak or hear. These sisters can now Interpret in sign language all the public talks, service meeting programs, ministry school talks, book study and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study comments. As a result eight deaf-mutes regularly attend the public talks and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study. Three of them are now sharing regularly in the ministry, reaching and exceeding the wholesome goal of ten hours and each placing as many as fifty magazines every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the great need to accomplish the ministry more fully, it was a pleasure to see fifty-three different publishers take up the vacation pioneer ministry during the year. Young and old alike shared in this grand privilege. One sister explains that, even though she has four children and a husband who is not as yet interested in the truth, her desire to help others come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and her love for Jehovah prompted her to arrange to vacation pioneer during April. She says: “With faith in Jehovah that He would bless my efforts and the help given by the servants of the congregation, I was able to reach my goals and conduct three home Bible studies regularly as well as starting three new studies, two of which were given to other publishers who needed training in this service. Now I find that the studies I presently conduct need more attention, so I have arranged to vacation pioneer during September and I will also have the joy of having my own daughter as a pioneer partner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are pleased to report that the work of preaching the “everlasting good news” is being carried on in Labrador. Last year we had one congregation reporting activity. During the year another congregation was organized, which means that we now have two congregations working in that area, with a total of fifteen ministers regularly serving Jehovah in the field. While the territory is rugged, the homes scattered and temperature cold, the brothers are joyful in their assignment and count it a privilege to present the good news of the Kingdom. Our work is relatively new to Labrador, and it is of interest to see that good progress is being made in the home Bible study activity, which we feel sure in time will produce many more praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW ZEALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,594,420</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,656 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 557</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from New Zealand says that the “Fruitage of the Spirit” Assembly crowned a year of satisfying progress with new incentive to serve Jehovah. It was a source of joy to note the enthusiasm of the brothers as they received the new truths and the timely counsel on keeping the organization clean, and the faith-building explanation of Jehovah’s promise to save the tents of Judah first when Satan makes his final disastrous move against the spiritual Judeans and their companions here on earth. Jehovah’s witnesses had a good increase during the year, and here are a few experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One eighty-year-old sister sets a fine example of zeal and fruitfulness in the ministry, although crippled with arthritis. Her disability finally made it impossible for her to leave her home or even to use the telephone or write letters, as she could not hold a pen in the usual way. Determined to have a share in aiding others to get out of Babylon the Great, she has learned to use a typewriter by tapping with a large pencil gripped in the hollow of her hand. As she had never used a typewriter before, this took considerable time and perseverance. Even now it is a slow process. She makes up her own sermons and keeps a list of the death notices in the newspapers. Along with letters to bereaved persons she includes a comforting tract. That her ministry is accomplishing its purpose is seen by the fact that brothers in the field ministry often meet those to whom this elderly sister has written. Recently, a brother in a distant town called on such a person who said that the letter she received had been of such Scriptural encouragement that she had referred to it time and time again since her husband’s death. As a result, this mourning one desired to learn more of the Kingdom hope. Thus the crippled sister is greatly encouraged in the knowledge that she can spend her time usefully in the service, attaining well above the congregation averages as she helps sheeplike ones to flee from Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loving discernment and patience in tenderly caring for the “sheep” also bear fruit. A pioneer sister relates how she started a Bible study with a woman, but when the woman discovered that we do not celebrate Christmas because of its pagan origin, she wrote and told the pioneer not to call again. With loving concern for this prospective “sheep,” the sister allowed a discreet period to elapse and then made another call. She was made welcome and found that the woman had been so upset about the matter of Christmas she had spent three days in bed without eating! Finally, realizing how foolish that was, she decided to visit all the clergymen in the district to get proof that Jehovah’s witnesses were wrong. The result? In her own words: “They stood there as cool as cucumbers and said that Jehovah’s witnesses were right! Didn’t offer even one argument!” A Methodist minister said: “We have done it for so long, we cannot alter it now.” When she raised the matter with one of her friends, she was told they did not want troublemakers in the church. She undertook to tell the Methodist minister why the churches are empty. “It is not because of television or movies, but because religion is a farce and the ministers are hypocrites,” she said. With her eyes now opened to see the truth, this woman stated that she could never have any faith in the clergy again. If they taught one lie so blatantly, they could tell others. She attended the Memorial and was thrilled with what she heard and saw. The Bible study continues and this sheeplike person rejoices that she is free from the uncleanness of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another experience shows how goodness as a fruitage of the spirit has been instrumental in leading four persons to a knowledge of the truth. A young man engaged in seasonal work noted that one of the gang worked very conscientiously and also refrained from the common practice of stealing the employer’s goods. On inquiry he was told that this honest worker was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Intrigued, the young man sought opportunities to speak with the brother, questioning him about his Bible beliefs, often exchanging positions with other workers so as to be near the brother, to engage him in conversation. A good witness was given and literature placed before the seasonal work ended. Eight months later they both met again on the same work. From his comments it was immediately evident that the young man had been reading the Bible-study aids. No time was lost in starting a Bible study with the young man and his wife. The other workers began to scoff as this man now imitated the brother’s course of honesty toward his employer. Through reading the magazines the young man began to realize the need to watch his associations, so one day he asked the brother how to decide which of his associates to retain. It was suggested that he try witnessing to them and be guided by their reaction. That very night he had the opportunity when two friends called on him. He read to them from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book the chapter on how this world will come to its end. Both requested a copy of the book for themselves and have since been attending the study held with the young couple, who are already sharing in the ministry. What a fine reward for cultivating the fruitage of the spirit by practicing goodness in daily life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,535,588</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 656 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,341</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark171"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in Nicaragua continue to be the light of the world there, because the whole world lies in spiritual darkness. They appreciate their responsibility and have done well in their preaching activity, and a goodly number have taken up the vacation pioneer work at different times during the year. Nicaragua received its greatest witness ever as far as the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom is concerned. The light of truth is penetrating even into the dark jungle area, as illustrated by the experiences sent in by the branch.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A man requested that Jehovah’s witnesses visit him on the east coast of Nicaragua. To the circuit servant he related how his interest was aroused. While working with a survey crew in the jungle, one evening he lay listening to a fellow worker who was reading the Bible aloud. As the man read the prophecy of Matthew 24, the one listening exclaimed: “That is talking about Jehovah’s witnesses. That is exactly what they preach.” In town he looked up the Witnesses and happily obtained two books and several issues of the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to study in camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even literal darkness does not instill fear in the hearts of Jehovah’s people, for their confidence is in Jehovah. During a circuit assembly a power failure put almost the entire country in total darkness for several hours. Under candlelight the program continued with no confusion or interruption. In many churches people panicked and fled screaming to the open streets for safety. A local newspaper remarked that they expected more from those who professed to be Christians. Of Jehovah’s witnesses, a sheeplike person was heard to remark: “Why, these people fear nothing. Nothing can stop them from preaching, not even total darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is it worthwhile to follow up a subscription promise or ‘just a magazine placement’? The following experiences emphatically answer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Yes!&quot;</span><span class="font4"> A sister writes: “One Magazine Day a man took two magazines and manifested a desire to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">but said that he had no money then. I made definite arrangements to call back, and when I did he subscribed not only for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> but also for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font4"> besides giving me the name of another interested person who also subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> Thus, by following up a promise, I was able to obtain three subscriptions and start a Bible study. This man has now started to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall.” Another writes: “One Magazine Day I met a Catholic lady who was busy but showed interest and took two magazines. Arrangements were made for a return visit and I started a Bible study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font4"> booklet. Soon her husband was invited to join the study, and the study was scheduled for a time convenient for them both. After only a few studies the lady manifested a desire to participate in the field service. They both began attending meetings regularly. When we had a visit by our circuit servant, I explained the purpose of the visit and also the congregation chart. The husband asked, ‘When can </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font4"> be counted in on this chart?’ He went out in the service with the circuit servant and placed his first magazine. Both are zealous publishers and happy to be contributing to the figures on the chart after only about five months of study.” Yes, two more “sheep” have escaped from the spiritual darkness of Babylon the Great because someone followed up on ‘just a magazine placement.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NIGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 55,620,268</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 38,285 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,453</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A recent census was taken in Nigeria and, when tabulated, it showed that there were twenty million more people in the country than reported on previous occasions. Last year the population was reported to be 35 million and now it is over 55 million. Jehovah’s witnesses in Nigeria are happy to learn of their increased responsibility, and they are accommodating themselves to it by devoting more time to the field. They realize that they have a lot more work to do. Now instead of having a ratio of one publisher to every 944, as it appeared in the 1964 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> their ratio is one to every 1,453. So they will not slack their hands. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they will be more energetic and serve these people with the good news of the Kingdom. Here are some experiences from the branch office with regard to Nigeria, Dahomey and Fernando Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We prove ourselves Christ’s disciples by Christian hospitality and love, as the following experience shows. The Witnesses contacted a man and his wife who were members of the Cherubim and Seraphim religion. When several back-calls led to a Bible study the wife began to oppose. She disturbed the study and drove away the publisher several times. In response to efforts to persuade her, she replied that never would she agree for her husband to continue with Jehovah’s witnesses. Before long a great riot took place in the town; many were killed and injured, and all the inhabitants fled to other places. The interested man and his wife fled to Port Harcourt. The husband looked for Jehovah’s witnesses and found lodging with them. This highly annoyed the opposing wife and she decided to seek refuge with members of the Cherubim and Seraphim society in Port Harcourt. To her great surprise they refused to take her in. Imagine her disappointment! In a dilemma she started to look for her husband. Shamed now, she submissively agreed to stay in the home of Jehovah’s witnesses. The brothers were very kind and hospitable to both refugees, until the police quelled the riot and they were able to return home. This lady was impressed by the contrasting treatment she received from her Cherubim and Seraphim members and from Jehovah’s witnesses, whom she formerly hated. Now she gathered up her ‘angel’ gowns and went to the leader of the sect: “From today onward I am no more to be a member of Cherubim and Seraphim.” She tore the gown in two and said: “I am going to make two dresses for my children, and all the family are to serve Jehovah from now onward. I am no more for you but for the Witnesses.” She meant it, for till now she is very active. She was immersed at a recent circuit assembly. The husband was immersed some time before. And what of the leader of the sect? Today he is the assistant congregation servant of the once riot-torn town.—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magazines are helping to turn some of our twenty-five million Moslems from Babylon the Great to God’s kingdom. A brother writes: “I was born and bred of devout Moslem parents and attended Arabic school in Epe. My father is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> Koranic teacher. My first contact with Jehovah’s witnesses was when I obtained a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> from a Witness who called at my home. I read the magazines with care and noted down the points, but, of course, I could not believe most of the things I read. So I bought a copy of the Holy Bible and compared it carefully with the Koran. Five days after the first call the Witness came back as he had promised. He answered all my questions satisfactorily, and I obtained several other Watch Tower publications, with which I made an unbiased examination of Islam and true Christianity. How surprised I was to find out that the Bible preceded the Koran by more than two thousand years and that the right way to worship God is not through the ‘five pillars’ of Islam! How disappointed I was when the Imams and even my devout father could not explain away the truths the Witnesses taught me from the Bible! Convinced, I gave up my law studies, attended the meetings, studied the Bible regularly, dedicated my life, got baptized at Ikorodu and now I am happy to be a vacation pioneer. Through Jehovah’s blessing and help two of my sisters and a brother have also dedicated their lives.” See what the magazines can do? Spread them widely in your territory, even if it is solid Moslem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“After the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study a young man brought up sixpence collection on a plate. We refused to take it and explained why. He was amazed and said, ‘Never before have I seen such a thing in any church—pastor refusing collection. This is indeed the true congregation of God. I could see it also in your behavior and unity.’ We advised him to use the money to get a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font4"> he did, and we arranged to study it with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DAHOMEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As Paul said, we should preach the Word in favorable season and in troublesome season. A publisher reports: “I felt sick and decided to visit a doctor. After receiving the treatment I tried to place the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’ </span><span class="font4">with him but he refused. So I left the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font4"> booklet instead. One day I called back on this man, and he was very happy to see me again. Then he asked a question, but the answer’ was in the booklet. He had not made any attempt to read it. I opened the booklet and showed him the answer. Since then he has been reading the booklet regularly. I took the circuit servant to see this doctor, and he subscribed for both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> for himself and took another two subscriptions for his junior brother. Since then I have been continuing to study with this man and he is now progressing well. He is also witnessing to his patients and placing booklets with them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The new arrangement for circuit servants to spend at least six hours in magazine work on Saturday is really a big step to increase magazine placements,” says a circuit servant. “Working the motor parks and markets of Abomey recently resulted in my placing seventeen magazines on one Saturday,” which is really excellent for this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FERNANDO PO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;212,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,554</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some time ago a fellow worker laid a false charge against the brothers, lyingly saying that they meet regularly to talk against the Catholic Church and the government. As a result, a brother was brought before the magistrate, who asked: “Why did you meet there where you were arrested?” He replied: “To study the Bible and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font4"> The magistrate then ordered that the books be produced in court. Not understanding English, he asked the brother to read a portion and translate to him. Hearing of Jehovah’s promise to restore paradise conditions here on earth, he was greatly delighted and expressed himself as wanting such conditions. Turning to the police officer who arrested the brothers, the magistrate said: “Are these the kind to arrest? Why not those on the streets who disturb us?” However, the official attitude still appears to be a nonrecognition of the existence of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Rio Muni the laborers are in the habit of asking for time off for “important business,” only to come to town to sue their masters before the council. So farm managers do not permit these visits to Bata. But because of being in subjection even to masters ‘difficult to please,’ Christians have a good reputation and reap benefits. A brother asked permission to meet the Society’s representative at the airport. The manager consulted with junior managers and satisfied himself about the brother’s deportment. Then he not only issued the travel permit to the brother, but the manager arranged business transactions in the town and actually gave the brother a ride to Bata—something never done for a laborer. Christian subjection brings benefits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This country changed its name on October 24, during our new service year, to Zambia. A new government has taken over. But before that time the brothers experienced much political intimidation because of their not taking sides in the elections that were held in January 1964. Many of the brothers were beaten, their homes and personal property damaged or destroyed, and a number of Kingdom Halls were burned to the ground. Jehovah’s witnesses in this country have, for the most part, stood loyal and firm for the truth and have not compromised their neutrality. By the end of the service year the situation generally was calm throughout the country, and the publishers were able to continue their preaching activity without too much interference. Here are some experiences from the branch. Also included is a report from Burundi, where some work was carried on during the 1964 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the months of March and April the brothers ran into difficulties in one area due to local bans that were put on the house-to-house preaching by one of the local authorities. The accounts servant in one congregation returned from attending a circuit assembly in another part of the country to find thirty-five of the publishers in his congregation arrested and imprisoned under this ban. (They had appealed, and their appeal was later upheld and the brothers set free.) At that time, of course, the accounts servant was very concerned for his brothers. He went and visited the chief who had had the brothers arrested, and, as he wrote to us: “I plainly explained to him that he was fighting against God, and he admitted to me that what he did was not right and that when he had met with the other chiefs of the area for a meeting they had told him that he was wrong in arresting Jehovah’s witnesses. He strongly recommended that I tell the other publishers to continue preaching, and he obtained a booklet from me. We were very happy to have seventy-eight at our following Sunday meeting, even though thirty-five of the brothers wei-e still in jail. We are telling you that we are not afraid, but all of us are strong, preaching from house to house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus showed that a Christian’s enemies could be those “of his own household.” (Matt. 10:36) This proved to be very true for a young African woman. After having home Bible studies for some time she began to attend the congregation book study, although her husband was not interested. Seeing this, her parents became very angry and told her to stop attending the meetings. Her refusal to do so led to her father’s pulling down the grass roof of her house and taking away the door, but the girl continued to sleep in the roofless and doorless house. Again, her father burned all her clothes and blankets and the mat on which she slept, leaving her only with the clothes she was wearing. But still the young woman continued to associate. Finally, her mother beat her with a big stick, and then her husband divorced her, and this only because of her determination to stick to the truth. She then moved to the territory of another congregation and stayed with a sister in the truth who treated her like her own daughter. During the recent visit of the circuit servant, he reported that this interested woman took part in all the field service activities. He said he was truly amazed at this woman who, though comparatively uneducated, had shown such steadfast faith in the face of family opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can never overlook the effect of just one copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Recently two sisters calling from house to house met a lady who said: “I’m not interested. I’m a Spiritualist.” However, she did take a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> as well as a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> The publishers almost overlooked calling back, concluding that there was not much point to it. But one day about three weeks later, being in the vicinity of that home, they remembered her and paid a visit. When she saw them at the door she was very happy, immediately inviting them in. She said: “I told you I was a Spiritualist, but I read in the magazine quotations from the Bible which showed plainly that when people die they are really dead. I marked those scriptures in my Bible and I have already shown them to the lady that was teaching me spiritualism.” She then showed us how she had marked Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 and other scriptures proving that the dead are unable to commune with the living. Immediately a study was started in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News” </span><span class="font4">booklet, and now she, in turn, is witnessing to the one who had tried to convert her to spiritualism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In many parts of the country territory is very limited indeed, with a large number of publishers for the population. A district servant reported serving with the circuit servant in a congregation and working the same territory five times during the one week, twice on one day. This was among African people, and their natural hospitality and friendliness are certainly a blessing when working territory that often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BURUNDI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,224,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 247,111</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preaching of the &quot;everlasting good news” began to be heard for the first time in the kingdom of Burundi in the month of October 1963. In that month two African special pioneers took up their assignment in the capital city, Usumbura. From the beginning there was good response, and after two months more than twenty Bible studies were being conducted. Later a group study was begun using the Swahili </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book. In January 1964 four graduates from Gilead arrived at Usumbura.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But now difficulties began to mount. It was evident that there were some persons of influence who did not want Jehovah’s witnesses in the country. The missionaries, who had received visas for an indefinite period before leaving New York, were issued temporary visas for just a three months’ stay pending the formation of a Society under Burundi law. Only in this way could they stay on in the country. Despite many efforts and some pointed help from a friendly, influential person, the request for registration was refused and the missionaries were forced to leave the country in May 1964 when their visas expired. The special pioneers had to leave shortly thereafter along with their families, leaving no publishers to carry on the preaching of the “good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,655,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,041 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 905</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the increase in gathering together the “other sheep” has not been so great in Norway, still they passed the 4,000 mark for the first time in the history of the work in that land. Another thing that gave the brothers in Norway a lot of satisfaction was the tremendous witness given to those living high up in the mountains as well as those along the fjords and on the islands. About one million people live in isolated territory in Norway, and it is estimated that at least a third of them were visited this summer by Jehovah’s witnesses. Both the congregation publishers and the pioneers have wholeheartedly supported this work of getting to the isolated territory. They wanted all the people that they could reach to hear the good news of the Kingdom. Here are some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is very important that publishers do not give up even if they are greatly opposed in the preaching. This holds true, too, when they are faced with religious intolerance. A couple of brothers working in isolated territory witnessed on an island off the western coast of Norway and decided to arrange a public talk there. They rented the school after getting permission from the school inspector. When this was made known to the false religionists of the island, they let their influence be felt and succeeded in making it impossible for us to have the talk in the school when we came to give it there. What should we now do? Should we drop the talk we had advertised all over the island? No, we decided to give it on the wharf. We made an alteration on the placard posted beside the school and told people to come to our new meeting place on the wharf. Down there we found a barrel and made it our platform, and then waited eagerly for eventual listeners. When the time arrived for the talk to start, there were only two girls there, and they had most probably come more out of curiosity than of interest. We wondered whether there would be a talk at all, when suddenly somebody came running and told that a rather big crowd was waiting for us on the other side of a storeroom on the wharf. We went there and found a crowd of about a hundred persons. They listened attentively to the talk, and we were very satisfied with the result, considering that the whole island has a population of about 400 and that at the same time a meeting was arranged for in the chapel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of our special pioneer sisters writes us the following experience, showing the importance of not waiting too long to invite interested ones to go out in service: “I would like to tell you about a woman with whom I started a study in the autumn of 1963. We started a study in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font4"> and she was very interested. I soon invited her to the meetings, and after a month she started to attend the Sunday public talk and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study every week. When we had studied together for about three months, I invited her out in the ministry, and despite her hesitating a little she went with me. Within a short time she witnessed from house to house and made her own back-calls. And now, almost a year later, she says: ‘I’m glad you invited me out in the service so soon. If you had waited it might have happened that I would have said No.’ Now she attends all the meetings and I know she already has made a dedication in her heart and also wants to symbolize it soon by being baptized in water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About half a year ago a special pioneer sister witnessed to an old man who was very infirm. He had a feeble heart and could hardly manage the stairs without feeling bad. “After having talked a little with him,” she reports, “I showed him the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book. He had no money, but told me to come back the following week, and then he would take it. When I returned the following week he sat waiting for me, and we started to study at once. He then told me that first he had been associated with the Inner Mission, then with the Pentecostal Church, and at that time he always told the Witnesses to go away when they visited his home. I wondered why he now had changed his mind. He said that for several years he had been ill and could not attend any meetings, but not once had a minister or preacher come to him from the religious societies he used to attend. This made him realize that they could not be the true religion. Since then we have studied every week and he is very happy to have knowledge from the Bible, and no more has he any fear of eternal torment in hellfire. Despite heavy opposition from religious neighbors, he is enduring and says: ‘I’m not afraid of them, because now I’m a witness of Jehovah.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PAKISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 93,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 170 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 547,059</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Pakistan appreciate that a clear command has been given to get out of Babylon the Great, and this message needs to be proclaimed in that land as much as anywhere else, because the peoples’ religion is part of the world empire of false religion. So the call goes forth steadily. While not many of the Moslem people will turn to the truth, but much prefer to keep to their own religion and live their way of life rather than according to the Bible, still some have changed. Jehovah’s witnesses in Pakistan are not discouraged. They have the responsibility to declare the good news and to do it well. Here are a few experiences from the branch as to what is being done in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Imparting appreciation of what is required of a Christian minister pays off in steady growth to maturity. A missionary writes: “For some time I studied with a man who right from the start attended all meetings and assemblies. In the course of our studies I had made quite clear what the requirements are for a minister. One day he told me he had sent in his resignation from the Masonic lodge and not long after that he asked if he could share in the ministry. As he was still a member of the church committee, even though he had ceased attending church for some time, I told him that he should leave this first. This he quickly did, and then began to publish regularly. Being at all meetings, he became conscious of service goals and set out to get his share of subscriptions for the campaign, obtaining six for the four months. For the past six months he has averaged eighteen magazines a month, among the highest in the congregation, placing these in house-to-house work and following </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> suggestions by contacting friends and using every opportunity to give a witness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Using every opportunity to preach often locates interested persons who would not otherwise be contacted. While waiting for an answer to their knock on a door, a missionary sister and her companion were informed by an elderly lady who came by that the person was away. Taking the opportunity to ask where this lady lived, they were invited to her home nearby. She was most happy to hear God’s Word spoken, and a study was arranged in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font4"> booklet. In spite of her seventy-six years of age, mostly spent as a member of the Methodist Church, she has constantly expressed appreciation for the new things she has learned. Concerning her study she often says: “Memsahib, this is very precious time.” While in the hospital, and after learning that the dead rest in the grave until after Armageddon, she asked: “If I die in a hospital, will Jehovah really remember me in the resurrection?” She now has </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> in her own language and calls this her “priceless treasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AFGHANISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Tact is needed in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> country where it is not possible to proclaim the good news openly, but, even so, all kinds of men are being reached. A German brother writes: “A person who recently came from Communist China, whose father is German and mother Chinese, asked me to teach him German. I agreed, provided we used the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book as a guide, and so started a study, also using the Chinese Bible. Since then he has been present at almost every meeting, which we hold in English, and, although understanding little of what is said, after one meeting for field service at which he was present he loaned me his car to make a back-call some distance away. Recently he told us in broken English that, although he does not know German yet, he has learned a number of things from us, particularly observing our Christian manners. He will not start a meal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in our house until prayer has been said, and on several occasions when eating alone at our home he has asked someone to offer prayer, as he says he does not know how to say one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,210,136</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,403 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 863</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here is another country where Jehovah’s witnesses have had a difficult time because of political agitation and turmoil. But the spiritual growth and effectiveness of the ministry have been very good. The publishers have taken advantage of every opportunity to present the good news of the Kingdom. A goodly number have taken advantage of vacation pioneer privileges and in that way have increased their magazine distribution, which is by far the best yet for the country. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in Spanish had a very excellent distribution during the year. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy with the experiences they have enjoyed, and here are a few of them as reported from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant writes: “I have been studying with a young man now for about three months and he has shown intense interest in the Bible. Every Monday when I am in this section, or even twice a week when possible, I call back and conduct the study. After about a month he seemed to be progressing but was preoccupied with something on his mind that had him disturbed. Upon inquiry he finally explained to me that very often he was awakened in the early morning hours and felt the presence of some strange influence. I asked him if he had any books or literature on spiritism or occult writings and he answered that he did have such a book, showing me one called ‘Black Magic.’ Explaining to him from the Scriptures the danger of meddling in such things and how Christians in a certain location in Paul’s day ‘brought their books together and burned them up’ in order to be free from spiritistic influence, he readily agreed that it would be the best thing to do, and we burned it up at once. Finding that this did not completely free him from the attacks, I found upon investigation that he had still other books on spiritism and mysticism, and these were also done away with. Now he is not bothered anymore with the voices at night and has begun to publish the Word of life, looking forward to the next district assembly to be baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fine Christian conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses is certainly noticed by the world, as evidenced by the following experience: “For the past several years a small congregation out in the rurals had been renting a room from a Spanish woman to use as the local Kingdom Hall. It was difficult at times to get together enough money to pay the rent, but they always managed to make it on time. After a while the owner of the building began to take notice of how prompt the brothers were with the rent in contrast to some of the others to whom she was renting. She also observed their fine conduct and decided that this religion must have something to offer that was different. Although very old and raised a Catholic, she wanted to do something to show her goodwill, so she instructed her son to turn over to the congregation a part of her property after her death. The son was agreeable and this was done during the past service year. The brothers not only have received the property but with the small income from it are looking forward to building a new Kingdom Hall in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PAPUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;543,235</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 407 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,335</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pagan beliefs, superstitions and witchcraft, all mixed in with false teachings of Christendom, have certainly brought about a great confusion in the minds of the people of Papua. The clergy of Christendom are responsible for muddling things up so badly in the minds of the people of Papua that it takes much time and effort to show them the difference between true Bible teachings and the theories presented by the clergy of Christendom. But the truth will overpower everything else if people take the time to study, and many are doing just that. Gradually the work is increasing in the islands, and from the branch in Papua, New Guinea, come reports from Manus Island, New Britain, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very fine native man showed much interest in the truth over a few years. But he was prevented from publishing and baptism because he had two wives. Both of these were fine women, and he had lovely children from each. After much study and thought he at last gained the strength to make the proper decision. The second wife was returned to her family across the bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After this he made rapid progress, was baptized and, a year later, was appointed a study conductor. His wife now made rapid progress in the truth and became a publisher. The other woman who had been his second wife also started having studies at her home and became a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a recent circuit assembly this woman who had been the brother’s second wife, now living alone and meeting Christian requirements, made application for baptism. When she came to be baptized, the brother who had been her bigamous husband was performing the immersions, and so he baptized his former second wife!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For several years one European publisher worked here alone, diligently serving where the need is great. After a few years of intensive teaching, with its ups and downs, two fine native men made their dedication and were baptized. But what a happy day it was when a family from Australia came to serve where the need is great! Soon womenfolk were becoming interested due to a sister’s now being there to witness. At the last circuit assembly two native sisters were baptized. This last month a congregation was formed. Another one of the many islands is now rejoicing.—Ps. 97:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in New Britain continue to push ahead valiantly with the great preaching work. But how would you feel if many of your new publishers came along, studied well, made a dedication and were baptized and then shortly after left and you never saw or heard from them again? No increases—how discouraging it would seem! Yet that has frequently happened in Rabaul. Native folk, after intensive study with the Witnesses followed by dedication and baptism, finish their work contracts with the government and return to their native villages up in the almost inaccessible mountainous regions of New Guinea. But how joyous was a European brother on finally reaching this area to find one of these returned publishers sitting on the roadside with his picture sermon book teaching a large group of native people gathered around him! How happifying your “knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord”!—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The congregation in Rabaul needed a suitable Kingdom Hall. Application was made to the Territory Land Board for a central and suitable free mission lease of land. The Board met. But what a meeting! All the church organizations, the Returned Soldiers League and social and political organizations had their special representatives there to tell the Board that “Jehovah’s witnesses are seditious, disloyal to the Queen,” and so forth. The Witnesses were there too and were able to give to this group a fine witness for the Kingdom and their stand of neutrality. Quickly by radio and newspaper news was flashed to even faraway Australia of the great opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses’ being granted this lease. With all this publicity and everyone opposed, just what could the Land Board do? In spite of all the combined opposition, the Land Board granted us the lease! A victory for Jehovah! Now the Rabaul congregation is busy witnessing to all the community, not only in the various features of field service, but there in their midst by the building of a very beautiful Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,268,318</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In most of New Guinea the orthodox missions are very powerful and operate vast plantations, hospitals and schools. But all that most of the natives know is if they do not pay their dues each Sunday they will go to “hell” and if they are “good” they go to heaven, where they will get plenty to eat. In a village near where special pioneers are working the Lutheran teacher has four wives and recently tried to commit adultery with a young girl he is teaching. But we are glad to say that many of the native folk are drinking in the truth from the Bible with the help of Jehovah’s witnesses. When the European minister in charge of the Lutheran mission heard that Jehovah’s witnesses were in “his” village he immediately came out to visit the village. Many there did not know him, as his visits have been so rare! He demanded of a native that he give him the blackboard the pioneers used in their sermon work and which had been left at his house, as he wanted to destroy it. But the native man stood firm and said that during all this time the clergyman had not been visiting them so why should he come now when they were getting a knowledge of the Bible? This minister has not been near since. Teaching of the Kingdom truth continues!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The custom here in many parts is that when a native baby is born a witch doctor carries out a ritual and “blesses” the baby. When a special pioneer refused to allow this to be done to his baby, many said that the child would wilt and be retarded. As the months went by, the infant thrived under the sensible care of theocratic parents, surpassing many of the other village children. Now the villagers can see that there is no proof of any genuine good in spiritism and are much more inclined to listen to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every year a special few of the native pupils in the public schools are chosen to go to Australia for higher education. This is a much-sought-after and highly regarded honor. A teen-age girl with Witness parents was chosen to go, but, in view of the times, wondered whether this would bring her happiness. After talking it over with her parents she made her decision, and, to the amazement of all who do not understand the urgency of these times, she now is busy in her village helping her illiterate parents and neighbors to gain an accurate knowledge of the Bible!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In a distant part of this new congregation’s territory, about nine hours’ walk and up a 3,000-foot mountain, is a village whose chief is an old heathen (really exheathen at this point). He heard about the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, became interested, and took it into his mind to build a new village where only those interested in becoming Jehovah’s witnesses would be permitted to live. Already over forty are living in it, but they needed help badly. The dedicated brothers at the newly formed congregation headquarters organized themselves so that at least two of them would always be in the vacation pioneer service and their territory would be in this new village. They could easily get in eight or nine hours’ witnessing each day, so they decided also to spend time each day teaching them to read—an ability that they themselves had only recently acquired—so that when the European special pioneer visited the village a few months later he found the old chief could read simple words from the blackboard and was making wonderful advancement in the truth along with all the others in this village!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The matter of voting has come to the fore in many places. The special pioneer carefully explained to all the Bible principle regarding this. Someone reported to the district officer that Jehovah’s witnesses were teaching people not to vote. This made it necessary for this officer to make a long trip to see the special pioneer. He was shown the Bible’s teaching on these matters. The officer then asked the special pioneer to explain clearly to all that they were free to vote but that they also had freedom of choice. The pioneer did this the next Sunday when hundreds came to hear the public talk. The result was that, not only did about 2,000 of the interested people get the proper view more strongly implanted in their minds, but many heathen in attendance also decided not to vote, saying that one day they too would likely be Jehovah’s witnesses. After the district officer left he made the person who had done the complaining come to the special pioneer for him to explain our stand. After an hour’s explanation he had the matter clear in his mind!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Paraguayan people are a proud race and very nationalistic. Even though the ability of the local brothers might not be as advanced as that of the Gilead-trained missionaries, at times they get a better response from their own people. The people of Paraguay understand one another and the Paraguayan witnesses of Jehovah can tell them what is needed without offending them; whereas quite often the Paraguayans show a sensitiveness to counsel when someone from a different country tries to explain things. Despite that, they still need missionaries to help the local brothers who have dedicated their lives to serve Jehovah as well as to get out into isolated territory, even though they may not be as successful as are the Paraguayans in getting a hearing ear. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch office in Paraguay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the units in Asuncion had the joy of seeing twenty new publishers begin in the service during the past service year. Proving that the truth is no respecter of age or person, three of these twenty were youngsters of eight years who had made sufficient progress with the help of their parents to present magazines and to give brief sermons, with the result that at times they would place more literature than the publisher who would accompany them. One of the new publishers is a sixty-three-year-old man who, in the space of two years, was taught to read and write by the ones who conducted a study with him. It is a joy to see this now-baptized brother take out his House-to-House Record to write down names, addresses and placements for future back-calls. Another new publisher is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> sixty-seven-year-old veteran of the Chaco war and former member of the opposition political party. He now sees that the true remedy for mankind’s ills is not revolution but Jehovah’s kingdom, and he now shares this belief with others in spite of severe antagonism from his family. Another new publisher is a crippled lady of sixty-nine who, notwithstanding severe pain from a foot injury, tries to go out among her neighbors with the truth at least once a month in addition to doing incidental preaching. These twenty, ranging in ages from eight to sixty-nine and from all walks of life, are making their voices heard in praise of the true God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The truth exerts a powerful force in the lives of many people. In an isolated assignment where frantic opposition is put up by the local priest, a special pioneer sister and her young companion had the joy of seeing a couple with whom they had been studying get married after having lived together for thirty years. By coincidence thirty people attended the wedding, and all of them, including the judge who performed the wedding, stayed for the circuit servant’s comments on marriage and refreshments and fellowship that followed. This isolated group now reports four publishers in addition to the two pioneers. The priest’s “scare” tactics are backfiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,014,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Peru have many interesting experiences, some in the cities and some high in the mountains among the Indians. Every effort is made to reach all kinds of people, because Christ Jesus died for everyone. So the responsibility falls upon those who have heard the good news to go everywhere. No territory is too far away to be reached, and here are a few experiences to show the persistence of Jehovah’s witnesses in helping everyone who has a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Real joy and contentment come to the zealous ones who participate in every feature of the preaching work. “Oh, I find making back-calls so interesting!” exclaimed one missionary sister. The reason for her enthusiasm in this case was the results from a normal door-to-door call. A Catholic lady, unable to answer pertinent questions on her own faith propounded to her by the missionary, was so upset by it that she went directly to her spiritual adviser, the local priest. She wanted to be able to answer Jehovah’s witnesses and so thought it would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a good</span><span class="font4"> idea to get a group of her Catholic friends together and have the priest come to give lessons on the Bible. To her request the priest replied: “That would be a good idea, but do you have a place large enough to do that?” She answered: “Yes, I have a large room.” “Do you have enough chairs, though?” asked the priest. “Oh, yes, I have everything we will need.” “How many do you think will be there?” “There are eight of us,” came the reply. The day and hour were fixed when the priest was to visit the women as their spiritual counselor. The time appointed came and went. No priest. No administering to spiritual needs. The lady went to the priest and asked him if he did not think that he should be more attentive to the needs of his flock. Infuriated, he told her he did not have time to waste just to go visit a few persons to teach privately, and he would much rather be left in peace. When the missionary sister called back after a week, the Catholic lady was waiting. “Come in and tell me why my priest won’t study the Bible with me.” In no time at all the seed planted here produced another praiser of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many, many people of Indian stock in Peru, and one wonders at times how they will be reached. Here again we see the outworking of Jehovah’s spirit as it supplies the answers. An interested person appeared at the Kingdom Hall in a town of southern Peru. He said he was just passing through and wanted to know what Jehovah’s witnesses taught, before he went back to his native village. After some intensive study, he took some literature and left for his own land high up in the Andes mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One morning as the missionary brother there was ready to leave for field service he noticed a stranger, an Indian man with his pack over his shoulder, standing near the home staring intently at him. Always alert to give a witness, the brother asked the man if he knew what the sign “Salon del Reino” meant. The answer was Yes. Jehovah’s witnesses were the people of the Bible. He had come to see them and to see their Kingdom Hall. One of his own people (the man mentioned in the preceding paragraph) had come to him with Bible literature and explanations about the Bible that were different. He liked what he heard. He wanted to know about the organization. He asked a number of questions about the Kingdom Hall and how the meetings were conducted, and then went away contented with his answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some time later the Society’s branch office in Lima received a letter from south Peru, down by the Bolivian border where there were no known Witnesses. It was signed by a group of seven persons who asked that the Society not abandon them and that someone be sent to visit them. They quoted Hebrews 10:25 about 'not forsaking the gathering of yourselves together.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The letter was sent on to the circuit servant, who made a trip down in that direction to find the group. Most of the people in the area were Aymara-speaking Indians, who readily directed the brother to a trail that led up a mountain in behind the town. There at an altitude of 14,000 feet they found a neat little hut with a sign outside that read “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” There was a group of persons brought together by the aforementioned men who were having meetings and discussions with the Society’s literature as their only help to study the Bible. What a happy time was had! Only one couple of those gathered was married according to the law of the land, so he was instructed how to help the others arrange their lives in accord with Bible principles to have Jehovah’s approval. One of this isolated group was able to attend the next circuit assembly for more instruction and training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC Population: 27,473,000 Peak Publishers: 34,918 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 787</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The proclaimed of the good news of God’s kingdom in the Philippine Islands have had some very fine experiences again this year. They are putting forth every effort to get into every nook and corner of the many islands that make up the Philippine Republic, and they are having good success. You will be interested to know that two special pioneers left the Philippine Islands to take up the service where the need is great in Thailand. So the Philippine Islands is now supplying publishers for other fields. There they have to learn a new language and work with different people. Getting back to the Philippines again, here are some experiences that were sent in by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Working unassigned territory brings many blessings, as is shown by this experience had by a group of publishers during this year’s unassigned territory campaign. Shortly after their arrival in town they were met by the town mayor, who tried to discourage them by telling them that many other missionary groups had been to the town but had all failed to make even one convert. The first two days of house-to-house witnessing seemed to confirm the mayor’s words. Not one piece of literature was placed in this solid-Catholic town. On the third day, however, the brothers arranged for a public talk in the town plaza, using the sound equipment they had brought along. The talk was attended by 300 persons, many of whom asked questions afterward, such as, “What difference is there between the way of worship of Catholics and Jehovah’s witnesses? Do you use images? Do you take communion?” Scriptural answers were given to all the questions, using the public-address system. News of the talk quickly spread in the town, and the following day the brothers were received hospitably, and every person visited listened to the message and took literature. Every day after that a public talk was held, followed by a question-and-answer session. Attendance continued to grow and more interest was found than could be handled. As this first group of brothers prepared to go home, many interested persons came and pleaded with them to be sure to return soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A short time later fourteen publishers were able to return to this town, and because of the large number of interested persons they had to arrange for public question-and-answer sessions. The townspeople requested a “chapel” and even offered materials to build a Kingdom Hall. When the campaign ended, four pioneers from the congregation requested this town as their permanent assignment and are now happily working there to render regular assistance to the sheeplike ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fine witness that young publishers can give is shown by a letter received by the branch office from an eight-year-old girl whose parents are special pioneers. The letter, written by hand in her native Ilocano dialect, reads: “Although I am only eight years old and in grade two, I am glad to inform you about my preaching activity. While going from house to house my mother and I called on the home of a teacher where a nun was visiting at the time. As it was my turn to witness, I gave the sermon ‘From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.’ Both the nun and the teacher said that they had never heard a little girl explain the Bible so well and both of them took a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book and some magazines. Since that time many teachers at my school heard that I knew how to preach. One day while we were assembling for classes eight teachers called on me to preach. I gave them the sermon ‘God’s Purpose for His Creatures,’ using Psalm 37:9-11, Matthew 6:9, 10 and Revelation 21:4. They wanted to give me money in appreciation, but I told them that Jehovah forbids his servants to receive wages for their preaching work. But I told them that I would bring them Bible literature for which they could contribute. The next day I was able to place nineteen magazines. Now at school they are calling me ‘a Jehovah’s witness preacher.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Old age is no barrier to accepting the truth, as is proved by an eighty-year-old man who was baptized at a recent circuit assembly. Just before his baptism he was visited by his former Protestant pastor, who did not want to lose him since he was a man of means and regularly contributed 10 percent of his income to the church. The clergyman pleaded: “Please stop associating with this false religion, because you are bringing reproach on our church. What will people think of an active Protestant like you associating with those Jehovah’s witnesses?” The elderly publisher replied: “Your organization deserves any reproach it gets. It is a lazy organization. I have learned more from Jehovah’s witnesses in a few months than I learned from your church in over forty years. You say I am an active man and you are right. But, then, why do you expect me to continue associating with a lazy organization like yours? No, I want to associate with an active organization. Jehovah’s witnesses have been in this town for only one year and already they have preached to everyone. When I was born, I surrendered myself to Rome as a Catholic. In 1916 I surrendered myself to the Presbyterians. But now I am finally going to do what is right and surrender myself to our Creator, Jehovah.” The pastor left with no further comment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Love builds up.” (1 Cor. 8:1) The love that was expressed by persons all over the world for the Portuguese witnesses of Jehovah, and the concern of persons of many walks of life, did much to encourage and strengthen those facing the persecution of the authorities in Portugal. Thousands upon thousands of letters were received by the Portuguese government expressing concern for the treatment Jehovah’s witnesses were getting in Portugal and in other places under Portuguese rule. Despite the persecution, God’s people put forth a greater effort than ever before, and the results show that there are now more than 2,000 proclaimers of the Kingdom good news. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine played a big part in letting the world know that false religion is riding the back of Portugal. Thousands of Portuguese citizens received personal copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and many were shocked to hear for the first time what kind of treatment Jehovah’s witnesses are getting in their own country. Up to this moment the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses continues. Here are some experiences sent in about the work being done in Portugal, Angola, the Azores, Cape Verde Islands, Madeira and Sao Tome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following experience shows that sometimes persecution brings about unexpected results. A policeman delivered a notice to the home of a brother that said he was to appear at the local police station for questioning. When he arrived at the station the brother was taken into a room with several officers, including the one who had brought the notice to his door. Questions were asked as to his religion and a good opportunity was given to witness about his faith. Most of the men belittled what he had to say, but he noticed that the officer who had knocked at his door listened attentively. During the hours that he was kept at the police station, the brother had a chance to talk directly to the officer, and the seed was planted. Back-calls were made and a study started. The police officer retired from the force, and it was the privilege of the brother who had received the notice to baptize him and be the first to welcome him as one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant was witnessing from door to door in an area where the doors of the houses were close to the street and those passing by could hear the conversations. He noticed a man who had stopped and was listening to what was being said. Not missing an opportunity to witness, the brother began to talk to the man after he had finished at the door. The man proved to be interested and took the literature that was offered him. He asked the brother to accompany him to his home not far away, as he had no money with him for the literature. At his home the man introduced his wife to the publisher, who took the opportunity to witness again. After a time the woman went into another room and brought back a copy of the Bible along with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </span><span class="font4">She explained that she had studied with Jehovah’s witnesses and enjoyed it very much but that her husband had heard that Jehovah’s witnesses were bad people and forbade her to continue the study. Nevertheless, she never stopped studying the book herself along with her Bible and prayed that one day the study could be resumed. All this she related in front of her husband, who now had a different opinion of Jehovah’s witnesses. The circuit servant made arrangements for a study to be held with the couple, much to the joy of the wife. On his next visit to the congregation the circuit servant was pleased to see the couple attending the meetings, and today both are publishers of the good news and are to be baptized at the next opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many people in Portugal make their living on the sea, and it is not an easy life. Very little time is spent at home, so rarely is there an opportunity to learn of the truth, and when the opportunity comes it must be made good use of. One fisherman first heard of the truth from another member of the crew, but shortly thereafter they were separated when one joined the crew of another ship. Fortunately, the crew member who had witnessed to his friend remembered his name and address and sent them to someone who would be able to make the back-call. The brother making the call had little hope of contacting the fisherman, but, to his pleasure, his first try proved successful. The fisherman had just arrived home but would be leaving again the very next day. Joyfully, the man invited the brother to sit down at a table and he brought out a list of twenty-four Bible questions that he had jotted down during the long hours at sea and that he had been saving for just such an occasion. After much time passed, the publisher made efforts to leave, but the enthusiasm of the fisherman made him stay. With only one day on shore the fisherman had much to learn and so the back-call lasted for seven hours, until three o’clock in the morning. The desire to learn was rewarded, as he is now a dedicated publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After discussing the doctrines of Jehovah’s witnesses, one Catholic priest ends his recent book by saying: “Under these circumstances can anyone honestly call for religious freedom for Jehovah’s witnesses? I end with the cry of a soldier: 'Watchmen of the nation, awake!’ ” The Catholic Church would very much like to suppress religious freedom in this democratic land. Will the government of Portugal bow to the will of the church? So far the evidence indicates it will. We hope and pray that the future will mean victory for free worship, but, no matter what the outcome, the pure worship of the Most High God Jehovah will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,605,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As was mentioned in the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font4"> three Portuguese brothers were expelled from Angola. One of these, a resident in Angola for over ten years, was forced to leave his wife and children in Angola while he traveled to Portugal in hopes of arranging matters so that he could return. The police said that within </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> few months he could reenter Angola. But his repeated requests for information about his case have been denied, and there is little hope that he will be able to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other brothers who were imprisoned for three years in 1961 have been released, although their activities are closely watched and some have been forced to remain in restricted areas, unable to return to their homes and families. Prison did not stop these brothers from telling others about the blessings under God’s kingdom, and many of the new publishers reporting this year are those who were earlier imprisoned for their unlawful political practices but who now have learned the truth and have given up the worldly things and are engaged in the peaceful pursuit of Bible teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are never sure where the seeds we sow will fall. The following shows that a placement of a booklet can have results that we would not imagine. The wife of one of Jehovah’s witnesses was conversing with her neighbor over the back fence and the subject of hell came up. The neighbor spoke of it as a place of fiery torment and, although she was not interested in the truth, the wife gave the Bible view of hell, saying that we would not burn our children because of their sins, and certainly this would hold true with our Creator. The neighbor became interested, but the wife did not explain further but told her to talk to her husband. This the interested woman did and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font4"> was placed with her. The woman read the booklet, but her interest cooled and the booklet was left forgotten in the house. Some months later a friend of the neighbor picked up the booklet, read it and asked where it came from. After being told, the friend contacted the brother and asked for more information on Bible subjects. A study was started, and the person has advanced to the point of attending meetings and going out in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AZORES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When an earthquake rocked the islands of the Azores in February of this year, the brothers were able to show how Christ Jesus prophesied that these things would happen but that we are to rejoice because the foretold Kingdom is near. Many people were comforted and are now studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. One of the islands that was worst hit was Fayal, and the circuit servant happened to be there at the time. He reports: “For five days and nights the earth seemed to shake constantly, and we feared to enter the houses lest they fall on us. Even though it was very cold I had to sleep out in the street. It was impossible to leave the island for some time after the earthquake, but we had good opportunities to witness and the time was not wasted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five years ago a pioneer started a study with an interested woman on one of the islands, but, due to opposition by her family, the interested woman was never able to take her stand for the truth. The study continued for almost two years until the pioneer changed her assignment. At that time the study was turned over to a regular publisher until it was discontinued shortly thereafter. Then, five years after the study had first been started, the pioneer returned to the island and called back on the woman. A change had taken place. A member of the family who had been living in the United States for many years and had accepted the truth had visited the islands and had witnessed to all who would hear. Now the husband of the woman had become interested and decided to take his stand with his wife in face of the opposition of their families and friends. The pioneer had returned at just the right moment. The study was started again, and the couple are making rapid progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">After the expulsion of two foreign residents of the islands the year before, some had the idea that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses would stop. When this did not happen, other measures were taken and our brothers have been threatened and told to stop the work. Realizing the necessity to obey God and his Word, they have continued to preach, but under great difficulty. There are several isolated groups and contact is being maintained with them, even though many of the things sent to them have never reached their destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 46 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,522</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Madeira, as in other Portuguese territories, the Catholic Church has launched a campaign against Jehovah’s people. Articles have been printed showing how Jehovah’s witnesses have grown and then asking “Why?” Their answer is that it is “because of the lamentable religious ignorance that has enveloped the masses.” The article goes on to say that there is a need “to return to true and profound religious instruction.” Jehovah’s witnesses in Madeira, as in all parts of the earth, are helping the people to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to reading such articles against us, the family of a young girl forbade her to continue associating with a publisher who was conducting a study with her. The opposition of the girl’s father was so strong that the study was discontinued. But due to her hunger for the truth the young girl continued her personal study of the Scriptures, and her tactful comments on the subject interested her aunt. The girl’s father relented when this older member of the family became interested and so, to the surprise of the publisher, the young girl came to the place where he worked, asking him to restart the study. Three members of the family are now studying and making fine progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAO TOME &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What would you do if you had no literature to use in the witness work? This was the question that confronted the brothers in Sao Tome. Even though they are few in number, measures have been taken to stop their preaching activity. Literature as well as letters has been denied them, making contact with the two isolated groups very difficult. For that reason not all the reports of activity were received by the Society, but what did get through shows that the brothers are determined to remain firm and have not stopped declaring the &quot;everlasting good news.” The lack of literature was a problem but did not stop the brothers. Realizing that there were few books in Bible times, the brothers spent more time in direct oral witnessing, which resulted in an average of over twenty-one hours a month for each publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,460,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,876 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 855</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark173"></a>The people on this beautiful island in the Caribbean have received a wonderful witness concerning God’s kingdom during the past service year. Jehovah’s witnesses are very interested in distributing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in Spanish. In the month of December they put out 6,491 copies of this Bible and in June, 7,370. In these two months alone they placed one-third of all the bound books distributed during the year in Puerto Rico, and these were Bibles. These Bibles became very useful in starting home Bible studies. There are now 2,888 such studies being conducted in private homes by the brothers. Here are some experiences on Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Tortola.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Following the counsel of the Society, many brothers were vacation pioneers during the year. In fact, in one month there were 106 vacation pioneers in the field. Especially were the young publishers helped by this arrangement, and these young ministers of Jehovah make a deep impression on the people. A young vacation pioneer writes: “I knocked on the door but noticed that the lady had a fear of opening the door. I knocked again and she at last asked me to come in. When I had finished my sermon she said, ‘Young man, I wish to ask you </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> question. What is your religion?’ I explained that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, at which she looked at me horrified and said that this just could not be, because her Roman Catholic priest had told her that Jehovah’s witnesses did not believe in Jesus Christ and were associated with the Communists. I was able to show her the truth as to these matters, at which she said that many times the Witnesses had visited her home, but she had never listened to them, but, seeing that I was a youth, she was very impressed, because the modern youths do not use their time in such worthy causes. Right away we began a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font4"> booklet and it is still continuing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon hearing the good counsel to study with all the members of the family and not to leave any out, a publisher decided to see if he could help his own daughter who showed no interest in the truth. He spoke to a special pioneer sister and so she began visiting the home and showed interest in the daughter. She would always talk about God’s promised new order, and finally the daughter began to study. “Don’t tell Dad,” said the daughter, “because I want to surprise him.” The study was held on a Wednesday night when the father was out on a Bible study. Upon returning home early one night from his study the father was indeed delighted to find his daughter studying and at once bought her a new Bible as a gift. Now the daughter is a regular publisher, participates in the theocratic ministry school and is teaching her seven-year-old son to be a minister of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the spiritual food provided by Jehovah through his organization is beneficial, and a pioneer tells us how one person was aided through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> “I began studying with a young woman, and as she read the life histories of the brothers in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> she stated, ‘I want to become a missionary even as these people are, but in another country.’ However, since she was supporting and caring for her invalid mother she had little hope of fulfilling her desire. I assured her that she could be a missionary right where she was. She did not think that she could, but gradually she began talking about the things she learned to her fellow workers at the factory. Then in December, during the Bible campaign, she placed a Bible a day. Later on, during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign she obtained twenty-one subscriptions, and now she is a regular and very active publisher. She plans to be baptized at the next opportunity. She still wants to be a ‘missionary,’ but now as a pioneer right here in her own country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seed sown by incidental witnessing can produce good fruit, as a missionary sister explains. “At our last circuit assembly I overheard the words: ‘Mother, look, the lady of the airplane!’ They came to me and asked if I remembered them on the plane in 1961. Of course I did. On returning to my assignment after the 1961 assembly I shared seats with a nine-year-old girl while her mother and young sister sat across the aisle. I planted the seed of truth and the hope of a new order in the heart of that young girl so that when a publisher visited their home, she and her mother accepted a Bible study. Imagine my delight to know that they are regular attenders at the Kingdom Hall and had already engaged in Jehovah’s service!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VIRGIN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31,904</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 151 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 211</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The use of illustrations is indeed important in the art of teaching. A publisher was offering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> but the householder was very prejudiced and did not want to hear. So the publisher said: “Well, I must go home now to prepare some pottage for supper.” “What is pottage?” asked the lady of the house. The publisher at once showed her that she was using a word from the King James Version of the Bible and then showed her how the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> uses the word “stew,” which is easily understood. This completely changed the attitude of the householder who now manifested interest in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brothers have been diligent in Jehovah’s service and reached a 23-percent increase in December. Their two new Kingdom Halls are now finished and their beauty is the pride of the neighborhood. It was good to see that for eight months out of twelve there was someone in the vacation pioneer service. All are looking forward to the coming service year, determined to continue progressing, to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TORTOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,760</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 408</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Applying the good counsel given by the circuit servant always brings results and Jehovah’s blessing. Pioneering was stressed during the circuit servant’s visit and, as a result, some took up vacation pioneering. Now one is a regular pioneer, and for ten months out of twelve there were vacation or regular pioneers working with the congregation. This has added a spiritual richness to the congregation during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The assistance arrangement was also stressed and, as a result of following through on the suggestions and counsel given, two families and two other young publishers were helped. Among these is a little girl about two feet tall and seven years of age. She can barely be seen when at the doors, but she speaks in a clear, loud voice and so is always heard. She amazes the people with her short sermons and comments, both in the field and at the meetings. She is a stimulant to other publishers, both young and old. It is as Jesus said: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.”—Matt. 21:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA LEONE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 476 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,252</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The drawing power of God’s Word has attracted many persons of honest heart in Sierra Leone and it is still doing so. The ones seeking the truth of God’s Word are drawing away from false religion, immorality and illiteracy. There has been a very good increase in this land, in fact, 18 percent, and this puts a real responsibility on those already in the truth, because they must help the new ones gain maturity. The branch office in Sierra Leone also provides reports on Gambia and the Republic of Guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It takes patient and effective handling of home Bible studies to help people to see the clear-cut line of demarcation between God’s visible organization and Great Babylon. It is not uncommon for a person with whom a publisher is conducting a home Bible study to make known his desire to share in the field ministry, while still an attender and supporter of false religion, the Greater Babylon. Of course, these persons cannot be invited to share in field service, for it would be doing him a distinct disservice in recognizing the truth and taking a firm stand on behalf of true worship. The publishers in Sierra Leone are endeavoring to help such persons to get “off the fence” by their devoting a little time after each study explaining how God is not pleased with interfaith, but if they wish to live in Jehovah’s righteous new order, they must give him exclusive devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A former church organist in one of the prominent parishes in Freetown was called upon by one of the special pioneers. Direct answers were given to him on questions about the trinity, soul, blood, and so forth. Right from the first home Bible study he was invited to the congregation meetings and has never missed a Sunday since. The local lay “pastor” and other church dignitaries made a visit to wean him back to church. He straightforwardly stated he wished to be considered no longer a church member and proceeded to explain the newly learned truths, concentrating particularly on the trinity doctrine. Armed with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Word”</span><span class="font4"> booklet, he soon baffled both lay preacher and members. The lay preacher asked: “Where did you learn this in such a short time?” Copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Word”</span><span class="font4"> booklet were placed all around, with the lay preacher ordering more for his friends. The former organist is now a publisher of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Demonstrating how the power of the truth can make big changes in a man’s life, a tenant in a house where a pioneer sister was conducting a home Bible study used to listen with great curiosity to the points discussed during the study as he sat behind the door in his bedroom. He soon wanted a home Bible study of his own. Although a heavy drinker, given to smoking and living with a woman to whom he was not legally married, he soon learned what it meant to abide by Scriptural principles. When the question arose over his marital status, he quickly accepted the Bible’s answer to his problem. That very month he traveled with his family over 225 miles to Freetown to legalize his marriage. Early this year, after having met the requirements for baptism, his wife and he symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. The man, his wife and their five children are now active publishers in the congregation, growing rapidly to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 35,111</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Would you get discouraged if after working several years in a land where the need is very great, bringing persons along to the point where they are approaching dedication and thus becoming publishers, you would see them move away to other countries? Even though many have moved from Gambia, are the brothers there discouraged? Far from it! They enthusiastically continue to preach. While others were moving away, the Society was able to send another special pioneer to Gambia during the service year. He is happily working with the other brothers in expanding the Kingdom witness in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hoped that in due time some brothers in other lands will see their way clear to take up residence in Gambia, where the need is truly great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GUINEA Population: 2,500,000 Peak Publishers: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 48,077</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Illustrating how handicapped brothers can be effective ministers, the circuit servant told of a blind brother who by memorizing complete sermons attracted several persons to the truth by his warm and sincere preaching. Not feeling sorry for himself, he followed the brothers in group witnessing as they walked single file through the bush paths and across streams, being guided only by the spoken word, not even a leading of the hand. In one village he started a study with another blind person. For over two years they studied hard. Finally the man asked to be baptized, but he still had two wives. It was explained that he should keep only the senior wife and dismiss the other. He did so. Then it was learned that he had a daughter about to enter a secret woman’s society. It was explained that Jehovah’s witnesses are separate from the old system of things and bring up their children in a Scriptural way. The blind man saw this principle at once and refused to give his daughter for entry into the society. Then someone in the village invited him to a chicken dinner. The blind man asked his host: “Did you kill this fowl for me?” Then came the reply: “No, it just died and we cooked it.” Immediately the man refused to eat, because it had not been properly bled. Could he now symbolize his dedication? Not only had he taken his stand on all these principles, but it was found upon questioning that he met the Scriptural requirements for baptism. What a happy man he was when he was told to be at the Kingdom Hall the next day to hear the baptism talk by the circuit servant! After the talk the brothers walked single file to the stream for the baptism singing Kingdom songs. Here, then, is a case of the “blind leading the blind,” but with everlasting life in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 15,841,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 19,221 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 824</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the past year the publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom in South Africa, Basutoland, Bechuana-land, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland have spoken the Word of God with boldness. Jehovah’s spirit was backing them up so that a great witness could be given to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. In Johannesburg they had a new experience. As a rule it does not get very cold there, but last winter snow was on the ground for some days. An African circuit servant found many more people at home during this week than under normal conditions. The brothers took full advantage of this situation. While not used to the cold themselves, the brothers in the congregation kept busy and were able to start twenty-three new Bible studies in this one week. Jehovah’s witnesses have certainly proved to be different, and here are some experiences from the territories under the direction of the branch in South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we had the privilege of sending blankets and used clothing to Malawi. The response from the brothers in this country was truly amazing. They were happy to come to the assistance of their brothers in another country who were in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Individual magazines play a great part in finding the “sheep.” Three months ago a publisher placed two with a young couple who did not accept the regular offer. A back-call was made and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> was placed. By the time of the second back-call they had apparently read the magazines, and the publisher, somewhat to his surprise, was met with these words: “We want to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.';</span><span class="font4"> we want another </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation;</span><span class="font4"> I have given up smoking and as soon as my contract expires I am going to leave the army.” What had stimulated their interest so much? Chiefly the article “Catholics, You Are Allowed to Read the Bible.” A Bible study was started, and at the conclusion of the first study the young man made the request to be trained as a minister. He has since commenced publishing and is zealously witnessing to his former comrades. The young lady too has manifested a fine spirit and has also expressed a strong desire to share in the ministry. Together they have built up a library of theocratic publications and keenly attend as many meetings as they are able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Train up a child” is good advice. An African circuit servant reports as follows: “I have a daughter who is four and a half years old. Since her infancy I have been teaching her from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book, all the pictures and their meaning; now she knows them all. She has been going with me every day in the field service. I thought to myself that we should teach her a simplified sermon, because she always inquired of me when she could do house-to-house work or preach by herself. I taught her the sermon, but she was not satisfied with only one scripture. She said she wanted all the scriptures that I use. Now she knows three different sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“She is my help during times of opposition. When I find a householder opposing I ask my daughter to give the sermon. One lady was very, very opposed to the truth. She did not even want me to present the sermon. I asked her just to listen to my daughter. Still angry, she listened carefully. My daughter opened the Bible and read different scriptures of the current sermon. The thing that made that lady show interest was that my child is still young, but she reads the Bible word by word. She took her Bible and followed my daughter as she was reading. Amazed, she asked how old the child was. I said, four and a half years. As a result, she became interested in the truth. I started a home Bible study because of my daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is more than one reason why we should have a personal subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> On presenting the subscription offer a publisher was asked: “Let me see your personal copy in Xhosa.” That made him scratch his head. It was something he could not do. The next morning he went to the congregation servant and said: “Brother, I have been worried the whole night, for I have never been asked such a question in the field and I have never subscribed and never even endeavored to do so. Now I am going to take out a subscription.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BASUTOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;641,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 211 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,038</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer was sent into southern Basutoland to open up the work there. When he arrived, there was just one publisher; now after just five months there is an isolated group of seven publishers. One of these was formerly a bishop for thirty-five years in the Zionist church. Said the bishop to the special pioneer: “You are not the first one to bring the Kingdom good news to me, but I used to drive away Watchtowerians without understanding what they were saying to me. Oh, please, teach me.” He has now resigned from the Zionist church, is sharing in the house-to-house witness work and will be immersed at the next circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Customary marriage is permitted in Basutoland. However, those coming into the New World society wish to get in line with Scriptural requirements. When it was announced that a circuit assembly would be held at Quthing in July, four couples had their marriages registered with the local district commissioner so that they could qualify for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BECHUANALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;296,851</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 248 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,197</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Going where the need is great applies not only to publishers but also to circuit servants, in view of the areas they have to visit. In this country the circuit servant and his wife have to travel no less than 600 miles across roadless desert to visit one isolated group of publishers at Shakawe. The transport is the back of an open truck, which, because of the deep sand through which it has to plow at walking pace, takes a week to get to its destination. The people in these parts have never before had the opportunity to hear the Bible message; church missions have never been there, so it is really virgin territory. In such places the work is most interesting. People come to the public meetings, but, having never heard of church, are quite unaccustomed to sitting down and listening to someone else do all the talking, so when the talk starts, they consider it a good opportunity to discuss with their neighbor the points that are being brought out. They are gradually being educated, however, to sit and listen and to talk afterward. The result of visiting this isolated interest has been two dedicated persons in this place and six sharing in the preaching work. Truly the good news is being preached to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. HELENA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 102</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Helena had an all-time peak of forty-five publishers in July. This is five more than the previous peak and brings the ratio of publishers to population down to 1 in 102. Considering the fact that two publishers died, one left the island and another was disfellow-shiped during the year, it can be seen that Jehovah has given the brothers increase there during the year. Each publisher has now just about twenty-five homes on which to call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A publisher placed a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> with a woman. When he called back the book was returned to him, as the husband was opposed. Six months later another publisher called and the same book and a booklet were placed. After several back-calls were made a study was commenced, standing in the yard. Six months later the publisher was invited onto the veranda, and then three months afterward he was able to carry forward the study in the home. Shortly thereafter the husband and daughter were sitting in on the study. A little later the woman dedicated herself and was baptized. Now the whole family are sharing in publishing the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The assembly at Keetmanshoop was unique in that there are no congregations in that area. It was a wonderful experience to see the keen appreciation of the twenty-eight publishers from the isolated groups. Most of them were there early on Friday, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> stayed for the final talks on Sunday. Even though they had to travel long distances, all the brothers stayed to have some share in the dismantling and cleaning after the assembly. The brothers from Oranjemund (five of them) had to travel all night so as to be at work early on Monday, and yet they insisted on staying until all the dismantling and cleaning had been done. Throughout the assembly the same spirit of appreciation prevailed. Most of the brothers had never before given a talk even to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> small congregation, so it was a new experience for them to receive assignments on the assembly program. Yet all the parts went over well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young woman and her husband were contacted by brothers, and interesting discussions on the truth were held with them; but they moved to another town before a proper study could be held with them. In the new town, however, they were once again contacted, and the woman restarted the discussions, resulting in a home Bible study with her. Soon she started coming to the meetings, and even having small parts on the program. Her husband’s minister then came to them, inviting her to attend his Bible classes at the Anglican church. She decided to discontinue studying with the Witnesses, stopped coming to meetings and attended the church Bible classes. To her shocked amazement, she seemed to know more about the Bible than the minister, as he was unable to answer her questions about the trinity, discredited the authenticity of the Bible and scoffed at the idea of creation in favor of the evolution theory. This made up her mind—back to the Witnesses! She has resumed her Bible studies with the brothers, attends every single meeting and has a regular share in the ministry. Her expression at a recent circuit assembly was: “We can truly see that Jehovah has only one channel through which he gives his truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The year opened with an atmosphere of growing tension and apprehension as to the political future of the country. For the first time our brothers had their neutrality tested. How very thankful they were for the most timely </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles helping them to have the correct attitude toward the “superior authorities”! Because of this Christian standard large numbers of persons now clearly discern the marked difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and those they thought were Christians. At one polling station the chief announced: “Before we all vote, there are certain people, Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos refusing to vote in the community. Let them come out one by one if they are still refusing to vote.” Two isolated publishers in the community stood out courageously. As a result of their fearless stand, an interested person unexpectedly took her stand along with the Witnesses, and she is now progressing as a congregation publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An African special pioneer is delighted with the marked changes that he and his wife are seeing in their four children (the eldest is eleven) since they have been studying with them. Now they are able to do house-to-house and street work. But the striking feature is that their appreciation for Bible study has reached the point where they now want others to enjoy the same benefits. Recently the four intimated that they would like to invite other children in the location. An hour later they returned with twenty-four others. Since that day the study has continued and all twenty-four come along regularly to the studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTHERN RHODESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,136,900</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here is another African country where Jehovah’s witnesses had to stand firm in spite of rising pressure from political intimidation. Most of the intimidation was in the form of mental pressure brought upon Jehovah’s witnesses. Many others, however, suffered brutal physical treatment. It is good, however, to be able to report that those who suffered this brutal treatment remained strong in their determination to do Jehovah’s will. During the past year Southern Rhodesia’s neighboring country, Malawi, had even more difficult times. This is reported on in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s witnesses in Southern Rhodesia were able to come to the aid of their brothers financially by sending necessary supplies, clothing and food, to assist the Malawi brothers in their distressing times. So Jehovah’s witnesses stand together and enjoy one another’s hospitality as well as extend this hospitality to others by preaching the good news of the Kingdom everywhere. Here are some experiences from the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following brief letter demonstrates a fine spirit in connection with supporting the Kingdom work. It reads: “Dear Brothers, Here is my donation to the Society for 1/- that my Daddy gave me for sweets. Instead of buying sweets my mind decided to send it to the Society, because it will help a lot more than to buy sweets. Yours, C--.” This boy was just five years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you train your children in this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you ever received a name from the Society to follow up? Have you put yourself out in order to find and feed such interested persons? One brother writes that he received such </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> notice from the Society, only to find that this interested person lived ninety-three miles away from the congregation, over a dusty road with mountainous travel. In order to make the trip, two days were set aside, and this necessitated adjusting various other matters. Finally the day for making this back-call arrived, and off they went. Let us listen to what this brother writes: &quot;The road was long and tiring, and we determined that the call would be brief, so we could return in good time. However, our arrival at 1:30 p.m. was met with such joyful enthusiasm that any thought of leaving early was dispelled immediately. This interested person's English was poor, but we gathered without doubt that we were very welcome. Our lunch and a special room for the night's stay was in readiness for us. The Society’s publications, just about all that have been printed in Italian, were produced; and the discussion, interspersed with study and teaching how to study, lasted until 9:30 p.m. that night. At 5:45 a.m. the following morning I was up to watch the sun rise over the beautiful mountains. I thought I was alone, but Mr. S--was right at my side, with two stools and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the publications in hand. We did not really stop until about 1:30 p.m., at which time we departed, with much joy and genuine friendship, for our home ninety-three miles away. What was particularly impressive was the tremendous extent of knowledge that had been gained by the faithful reading of the Society’s publications. There were very few issues that he did not clearly understand. When asked what he thought would be necessary now to make real advancement in the truth, he replied without hesitation that he would have to give up his present isolation and come into a town to associate with a congregation. This he plans to do. We appreciated the privilege of making contact with this sheeplike person and hope we can help him to progress still further.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many fine experiences were had in our Bible campaign, and a sister relates hers: &quot;I am a schoolteacher, and during the recent June Bible campaign I had a truly wonderful experience. The school curriculum allows one hour of Scripture a week, and during this period I have made use of the Society’s publications for my material. Also, I use the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> for any Bible references. During the Bible campaign I was hesitant whether or not to suggest that some of the class take copies, but I felt that more good than harm would result, so I made the offer. The first Bible placed was with a little boy. Upon entering the classroom I gave him his copy. The expression of sheer joy and exhilaration on his face was too marvelous for words. This sparked off the response of other children and within a few days seventeen children were proud possessors of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It wasn’t long before the inevitable happened! The clergyman made his call and, to his horror, saw and tried to discredit the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> before the children. But I had expected this and had prepared the children with references from their new Bibles, which they were eager to show him. This turn of events was most surprising to the clergyman and, needless to say, his visit was quickly terminated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 30,338,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,502 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 8,663</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite every kind of obstacle put before Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain during the past year, they have pressed on declaring the good news of the kingdom of God. Being filled with Jehovah’s spirit, they boldly declare “all the sayings about this life.” While today many people in Spain are fleeing from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, there is still a great amount of work to do, and the ministers of God know that. This, of course, causes Jehovah’s witnesses to intensify their activity in every feature of the preaching work. In Spain 544 dedicated servants of Jehovah God were able to make the necessary arrangements to vacation pioneer during the year. Thus 18 percent of the average number of publishers in the country engaged in that service. Here are some interesting experiences from Spain, Andorra and the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The course of a family of sculptors is additional testimony to the fact that Satan’s accusation that man serves Jehovah only for materialistic benefits is untrue. They owned a small factory, which they inherited from their father, and they specialized in the making of religious images for churches. What a dilemma they faced when a Bible study was started with them! Should they continue making religious images, which had provided the family’s daily bread for many years, or should they put spiritual interests first and choose the truth as expounded in the Bible, which prohibits such image making? The decision: A big hole was dug behind the factory, and as the religious images were brought out, the two fleshly brothers smashed them to smithereens with heavy iron sledgehammers, and then covered over the hole with dirt. Since then the family has continued to eat the literal “bread for the day” provided by Jehovah, and in addition has become spiritually rich, for “the blessing of Jehovah—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses serve as living signposts in their respective territories. An example of the benefit received from preaching close to one’s home or place of work is indicated by the following experience. A sister who is secularly employed at a neighborhood market began to work a territory adjacent to her place of work. One day she was approached by a shopper during her working hours who asked her if she would come and visit her in order to help her to learn the truth from the Bible “without any deceit.” How did she know that the sister was a minister of the Bible? The woman explained that she lived close to the market. When she was originally visited by the sister she had indicated that she was not interested, but now, after realizing that she was being deceived spiritually, she wanted to know what the Bible has to say on the subject of the true religion. She had also observed the sister’s upright conduct at work, and was happy to know to whom to direct herself for aid when she became conscious of her spiritual need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While there has been much publicity during the past year that religious freedom will soon be extended to non-Catholics in Spain, officials are quick to assure that such liberty will not apply to freedom of religious expression. Therefore there has been police action against the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses in at least eleven provinces during the year, and many fines and jail sentences have been meted out. However, even in prison Jehovah’s witnesses realize that there may be interested persons present, and they consider such a sentence as an assignment from Jehovah in order to reach persons normally isolated from the truth. One brother, imprisoned because of his integrity to God, received a letter from one to whom he preached in prison and who now lives in another country. The letter was addressed, “Dear Brother,” and continued: “Do you remember those hot summer nights when we were allowed to walk in the patio, when you told me so many, many things about the Bible that I had never heard before? What happiness you will have to know that your words were not just tossed to the wind! I am among Jehovah’s people. You, my brother, directed me to the source of the water of life and invited me to drink from that fountain. Thanks to Jehovah, I was able to dedicate my life to him at the last assembly, thus changing my whole course of life.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Andorrans are a hardy and traditionally independent people, living in a cluster of mountain valleys of the eastern Pyrenees, where peaks rise as high as 10,000 feet. While sheep and cattle grazing and agriculture are important industries, often a materialistic atmosphere pervades in the half-dozen mountain villages of the nation. Due to the country’s unique location between France and Spain, a large number are engaged in trading negotiations, which leaves little time for learning about God’s promises concerning a righteous new order. Nevertheless, ministers serving in Andorra and who speak Catalan, the country’s official language, were pleased to see a 33-percent increase in the average number of publishers during the year. A total of eleven were on hand to attend the annual Memorial celebration of the Lord’s death; so it is hoped that during the coming year more native Andorrans will come to appreciate better the true meaning of Jesus’ sacrifice and the truth that truly sets one free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CANARY ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,001,300</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While participating in the door-to-door work, a pioneer took proper note of a woman who showed a flicker of interest in the Bible’s message, in order to make a back-call. However, each time the return visit was made, the householder for one reason or another was not able to listen to the good news. On one occasion the woman’s husband answered the door. Rather than making another arrangement for calling back, the pioneer took advantage of the opportunity to witness to the husband. A Bible study was started with him and, about a month later, the wife also joined the study. Now both are publishers of the good news, regularly attend the congregational group Bible studies together with their children, and they have hopes of soon dedicating their lives to Jehovah. Never pass up the opportunity of giving a witness to all members of a household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than twice as many as the peak number of publishers were on hand for the Memorial celebration, so the brothers look forward to further expansion, aiding many more of these sheeplike persons to Christian maturity during the new service year and opening up virgin territories as yet untouched by the Christian preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SURINAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Surinam are going to remember August 28, 1964, coming just before the end of the service year. It was on that day that the new missionary home and branch office was completed and the family took occupancy. The brothers in Surinam built this home. They did all the work and were grateful for this privilege. The witness work moves on apace in this country too. The branch office tells us of one missionary there having thirty-five addresses on her magazine route. She places 140 magazines a month on the route, and her monthly average is 226. When the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> came out in the Dutch language, she visited all the people on her magazine route and placed twenty-four of these Bibles in one day. The branch servant writes: “Why don’t you try to develop a magazine route?” Here are some other experiences from Surinam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you work every section of your territory with the same willingness? Some shy away from certain sections, but miss out on wonderful blessings. Two special pioneers decided to work a section where mostly government officials live. They found a man who was just waiting for the truth. Previously this person had the idea that the Adventists had the truth. But after a short conversation his interest was directed to Jehovah’s witnesses, and he wanted to know more. He took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and a study was begun. When the Adventists realized that he was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, they tried to influence him. But with the little knowledge he then had, he was able to cause the false shepherd to retreat. This victory stimulated him to continue in his search for the truth. He is now en-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">joying the ministry and is making rapid progress. This joyful experience would have been missed if this section of the territory had not been worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once we have progressed far enough with a home Bible study, the time has come to explain the Scriptural standards of clean living. We should never shrink back from so doing. A lady who was living in a consensual relationship realized after a careful study of God’s Word that she had to change her way of life. She left the man with whom she was living, since he did not want to marry her, and this in spite of the fact that she was entirely dependent upon him, being sickly herself. Since she had received the strength to clean up her own life, she wanted to put things in order in her own house. Her daughter too was living immorally. The woman explained to her that if she wanted to remain in her house she had to live according to Bible principles. The fine example set by her mother helped her daughter to make up her mind. She married, and both she and her husband are attending the meetings. All three are looking forward to the coming district assembly to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah. Applying Bible principles in one’s life means joy and happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Religious indifference and godlessness have advanced to a point where one State Church spokesman complained that the Russians are jealous of the Swedes because they have advanced farther as regards godlessness than they have in Russia. We might ask, Whose fault is that? The clergy are paid by the State to preach religion, but not Jehovah’s witnesses. Out of love Jehovah’s witnesses press into every nook and corner of Sweden, and, while the majority of people are indifferent to the Bible, many are favorably impressed by the wonderful message that Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing them. Here are a few experiences on what is going on in the country, as sent in by the Branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we meet old people in our territory who take literature we may be inclined to think there is not much point in following up the interest, but old people do accept the truth. A congregation servant received a telephone call from an eighty-four-year-old man who said that he had read a book about paradise and that he understood from what was said in the last chapter that it was necessary for him to dedicate himself and be baptized. He wondered if arrangements could be made for him to be baptized as, said he: “I believe I will receive more of God’s spirit if I get baptized and will get more courage to preach.’’ He had endeavored to speak to his sons about the things he had learned but had met with opposition. Later, when visited by the brothers, there was no doubt about his understanding the meaning of baptism. Before being baptized he was driven to the church where he was struck off the membership list. After the baptism he handed the congregation servant a tobacco pouch and said: “I understand that I must be clean from all things that are not wholesome, so please throw this away for me so I won’t have to see it again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Teamwork between pioneer partners and starting a Bible study at the first back-call resulted in the following fine experience. A pioneer sister had called on a family who showed opposition to the message, but she felt that she had stirred up interest. In order that these people should not feel obligated to maintain an opposing attitude because of what they had said to her, she turned the call over to her partner who made the back-call the first week in May. After the usual greetings, when all were seated the pioneer suggested that they study the Bible rather than just have a discussion. Even though this was her first visit there, the sister opened the study with prayer. A regular study was held, during which they showed much interest. They agreed to continue the study and were invited to the meetings. Since that time they have attended the meetings regularly, have gone out of the State Church and have made other major changes in their lives. They were soon speaking to others and by midsummer they were out in the house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When is one too young to take part in the service? A brother relates that his daughter who is five was given an assignment to give the simplified sermon at the service meeting last January. She did very well but then wanted to use it in the service. Her parents decided she had better wait till she started school, but one day while they were out in the service the little lady asked to go with another sister from door to door. This she was allowed to do. When the sister knocked at the first door the five-year-old stepped forward, gave her sermon, and placed two magazines. After this the parents agreed to let her use her sermon in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What has been the result? Well, she placed one subscription and has reached the goal for both magazines and hours since that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Perseverance and true neighbor love are necessary in order to help the people in the world understand the message contained in God’s Word. People today are so busy with the cares of this life that they do not think deeply on what the publishers of God’s kingdom have to say to them when visiting them at their homes. Only the patience of Jehovah’s witnesses causes a householder to stop once in a while and consider their words more carefully. Finally, some of them recognize the truth of the message of Jehovah’s witnesses. So it goes year in and year out. The good news is preached in all parts of the world, including Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Here are some experiences from these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I took car-driving lessons from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> young man some time ago. Sometimes I thought I should speak about the truth to him, but feared he would tell me to pay attention to the traffic instead. But where I failed, Jehovah opened up the way for me. During the last lesson before my driving test, my teacher asked me if I could get a Luther Bible for him as he had heard I was active in a Christian work. I asked him if he would not prefer a Bible with God’s name in it. Astonished, he asked: ‘Does God have a name, then? What is his name?’ and many other questions. A new outlook opened up before his eyes, and at the end of our discussion he asked me to speak to his fiancee, who is Catholic, and explain to her the heathen foundations of her faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I began an enjoyable home Bible study with this young couple. Naturally he wanted his mother to join us, as she lived in the same house. But for a whole year she showed no interest. Then shortly before the assembly in Munich we had the unexpected pleasure of welcoming her to our study. My joy was full when all three accompanied me to the assembly, and the impression this made stimulated the mother to join me in the service. Shortly before Christmas she remarked that her brother would visit her from Germany. ‘What big eyes he will make when he finds no Christmas tree in our apartment!’ she said. Instead of the usual celebration, a Bible discussion was enjoyed by these three people with their guest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This gentleman was so stirred by all he heard that he remarked at the end of a study: 'If all this is true, then I have been misled by my church all these years.’ The newly sown seed began to spring up in this sincere heart. He procured a Bible and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font4"> and asked that we arrange for someone to study with him in Germany. A study is now being held regularly in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By Jehovah’s leading, four people have learned the truth. This has taught me to heed the words in 2 Timothy 4:2: ‘Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Heeding the “golden rule” bears the pleasant fruitage of peace, as this example shows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font4"> had been studying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book for some time with Mrs. A---, who had much dissension with her</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">neighbor. All members of both families suffered from these tensions and quarrels, and Mrs. A---- herself</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">became a tranquilizer addict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As our study progressed this lady agreed with me that it should be possible to live in peace if people would only make an effort, accept correction and be led by God’s law. Gradually I began to recognize the fruits of the spirit as she put off her old personality, and the day came when she had the courage to speak to her neighbor with whom she had hardly exchanged a cordial word for years, and ask her pardon, although she was certainly not alone to blame for the state of things. All concerned were happy and felt freed and, if they had not become friends, at least they were glad to ‘pass the time of day’ when meeting, and Mrs. A---- ceased taking tranquilizers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But the story did not end here. The neighbor, Mrs. Z----, was opposed to the truth. She definitely rejected</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the message when I called at her door, and the measure seemed full when our study began right next door. But now listen how things developed! Her face alight with joy, our pioneer sister came up to me at the Kingdom Hall and asked: ‘Have you a study with Mrs. A---?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just think! Mrs. Z---was about to close the door when</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I called; then she saw </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in my hand and her face brightened up. “Oh, you come from Jehovah’s witnesses. Please come in, I must quickly tell you something.” ’ And she learned the incident described above. ‘There is really something in your religion,’ said Mrs. Z----, ‘because I arn sure Mrs. A---- was encouraged by a woman in your faith to make peace with me. I have seen her going there regularly.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The pioneer sister continued to call on Mrs. Z----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and it was a joy to see her prejudice against us broken and her opinion definitely changed. When I went to have the study with Mrs. A--- a few weeks ago I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">saw Mrs. Z--- in her garden. I greeted her, and she</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">came toward me as I remarked with pleasure about her beautiful flower beds. We chatted a little while and then Mrs. A--saw us and joined us. She invited us</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">both into her home, and Mrs. Z--accepted and took</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">part in the study, which lasted two hours instead of one, because Mrs. A---was so keen to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I was astonished at her zeal and how efficiently she tackled the situation, stimulated by the joy of this experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Since that afternoon Mrs. Z---has enjoyed further</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">visits and has started a regular home Bible study, and I hope that my interested person will find courage to join me in our ministry through this experience, which demonstrates that practicing true Christianity brings forth a bountiful fruitage of peace and joy.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During the past service year a brother responded to the call to serve where the need is great and moved to the principality of Liechtenstein. So there are now six publishers regularly preaching the good news of the kingdom in this Catholic-influenced territory. The publishers must exercise caution in going from house to house, for as soon as a Catholic priest gets wind of the fact that a witness of Jehovah is preaching the Bible message in his preserves, he calls the police and induces them to stop the witnessing work. This pressure of the priests is often irksome to the police themselves, and it seldom goes beyond a short interrogation of the publisher on his activity, and then he is sent away with the advice to stop his preaching work. But the publishers in Liechtenstein obey God rather than men, and so the clergy and the police will have to get accustomed to the fact that the message of the Kingdom, which is being preached in the whole inhabited earth, will also be heard in Liechtenstein. The people admire the fearlessness of the publishers and some of them are willing to study the Bible with them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the past year further progress was made in helping the witnesses of Jehovah understand the Bible principles and the need of leading a Christian life in all respects. This strengthened the organization in Taiwan. Sometimes it takes years to show the overseers of congregations how important it is to take a deeper interest in helping the brothers in the congregations. Jesus said: “Feed my sheep,” and overseers must do this if the sheep are going to grow to maturity. There has been a slow but steady growth to maturity among the Ami and other tribes. This, of course, brings real joy to all those preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Here are some experiences reported through the Taiwan office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The branch office has been stressing the need for more personal assistance to the weaker ones, and a missionary writes the following experience that illustrates the value of such assistance. “Following the circuit servant’s visit our congregation book study was divided to give more convenient locations for the publishers and interested ones being studied with. Although this left us with only five regular attenders in our service center, we accepted it as a challenge and an opportunity to render assistance. Each publisher made it a point to try to assist at least one person to attend by leaving home earlier than usual, sometimes up to an hour earlier, going to the home of an interested person and walking with him to the meeting. As a result, the first night saw ten in attendance, or an increase of 100 percent! The conductor soon established a route so that he would have four or five with him by the time he arrived at the meeting.” The result of the brother’s enthusiastic support of this arrangement is that the meeting attendance is now triple that of the service center before the division was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to rather slow progress in the past sometimes publishers may become pessimistic about making the extra effort to study with those whose interest does not seem to be outstanding. This was the feeling of a brother who was conducting two studies in addition to taking care of his family obligations. The circuit servant placed a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription with a man who was interested enough to agree to a study. When the circuit servant asked the brother what time he could conduct the study he felt like refusing, but decided to start the study, for he felt that it would not last long anyway. The publisher states: “When I encouraged the wife to take part in the study along with the husband I found that she too was interested and after a few studies was keenly enjoying what she was learning. This couple had been raised in Buddhist families and were entwined in the various rituals and beliefs of that religion. By the time they had finished studying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font4"> booklet they had grasped the fundamental things about Jehovah, Christ Jesus and the value of the Bible. They saw that idols were of no value; however, to break away from the ancestral traditions proved to be no easy matter for them. Like the majority of Buddhists, they felt that if they did no harm to anyone and just went along with the traditional rituals and ‘pai-pai’ feasts in honor of the ancestors they could still be considered good. However, their frankness in discussing these matters encouraged me, and I continued to study with them and to use the Bible to help them get the right viewpoint on such matters and Jehovah’s righteous requirements for pure, acceptable worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Then one evening a long-time friend of theirs sat in on the study and endeavored to defend the Buddhist way of thought, and in doing so referred to both himself and the interested couple as Buddhists. To my surprise and delight, the husband straightforwardly told his friend that he and his wife no longer regarded themselves as Buddhists! This proved to be a turning point, for they soon began attending the congregation book study and then engaging in field service. The wife, being a schoolteacher, was able to share in field service often during the summer vacation and attended the four-day “Fruitage of the Spirit” district assembly in Taichung, where she symbolized her dedication by being immersed.” The husband too continues to make good progress and has indicated his desire to be baptized soon. This from a study that the publisher was not too anxious to conduct!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While the truth has been preached for many years in Thailand, the response has not been very great. It is a Buddhist country, but you will also find Catholics, Protestants and nonbelievers. It is difficult to arouse their interest in the Bible. They certainly need the truth, and Jehovah’s witnesses continue with patience in their preaching activity regardless of obstacles, whether it be persecution on some occasions, materialism on the part of the people, or the indifference of the population. The work must go on until Jehovah says enough has been done. Here are some reports as sent in by the branch office in Bangkok on Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While in Magazine Day activity in a Chinese section of Bangkok, I met a Chinese girl about twenty years of age who said she already had the magazine, and then brought out a copy of the special April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">in Thai. She readily accepted the two latest copies and mentioned that her older brother was a nominal Christian and that she had gone several times to a Chinese Protestant church with a friend. A back-call was arranged and a Bible study started in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News’’ </span><span class="font4">booklet with this girl and her brother. Their mother, although a Chinese Buddhist and ancestor worshiper, was very friendly and had no objection to her children’s studying the Bible. Interest seemed good during the studies, but after a month or so the brother no longer wanted to study because the information learned was different from what his church had taught him. However, the girl continued to study regularly and to grow in knowledge and appreciation of the Scriptures. After a few months the girl began attending public lectures at the Kingdom Hall and soon was remaining also for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and sharing in answering questions. After studying for just five months, she has now started in field service and is very happy that she has found Jehovah’s true worship with his people. This experience highlights the importance of following up </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font4">interest shown, including that manifested when we call on Magazine Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMBODIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,750,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">One young Cambodian girl accepted the magazines but did not show any great interest at the initial call. However, on return visits a study was soon started and she progressed very well. Being aware of the need to help her friends come to know of these new things learned and help them break free from Babylon the Great, she has been instrumental in starting three new Bible studies. She is regular in helping one of the missionaries conduct a Bible study in Chinese by translating for her. This once again illustrates the need of making return visits on all placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A foreign person living in Cambodia was helped by a Bible study but made little progress. After returning to England when she “saw the vastness of the organization and how it is able to organize such wonderful conventions as the ‘Everlasting Good News’ Assembly and to do all the work on a voluntary basis,” she was moved to make fast progress. She soon inculcated in her young children ages four and six the importance of not playing with toy guns and such things and the reason why this was wrong. They were also taught to take a Scriptural stand on the flag and anthem issues and thus maintain their integrity in school even at such a young age. All this fine progress was made in just four months of diligent study. After returning to Cambodia and trying to find the missionaries at home she finally succeeded by calling at eight in the morning. We all were thrilled to hear her determination to pursue her studies and attend the meetings with her children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BAOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Although both Buddhism and Communism leave the people in the dark concerning the Creator, there are many there who are thinking about this and even searching for the truth. A young Vietnamese father who never quite believed the evolution theory was helped by a booklet on the Bible he once picked up at a fair. He later bought a Bible for himself, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a King James Version,</span><span class="font4"> and got a lot of satisfaction from reading about creation. However, when his children began to ask questions on the sun and stars he could not answer. Then he heard about some missionaries who went about teaching the meaning of the Bible. He called at their home, and because they were Jehovah’s witnesses they did not let that hungry one go; a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font4">book was started, and yet another one was added to the ranks of those who know whom to thank for the wonders of creation. He is now showing his thanks by telling it to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Great enslavement to Babylonian traditions and customs is a problem here. The practice of having a second or “little” wife, while sometimes practiced secretly in the West, is an accepted custom in Laos for those who can afford it. A man who had been studying for several years but had never fully appreciated the importance of following Jehovah’s principles was awakened to them by reading the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article “Toying with Sexual Immorality.” This man, educated according to Babylon’s standard, sent back his “little” wife to her parents. And, furthermore, acting on his new knowledge of Jehovah, he brought his first wife from many hundreds of miles away to return to the natural family arrangement. Earlier he had said: “I wasted two years because I didn’t accept the help of a Bible study and I never saw the point. I had always thought, ‘Why study? I’m educated. I can learn the truth for myself.’ ” But now he sees the point and he is making good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VIETNAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 14,929,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Like a boil spewing out its pus as an outward evidence of inner uncleanness, the recent interreligious riots and massacres are just an evidence of the real state of Babylonish religion. Here, for those who have eyes to see, is a close-up of the spirit of this world—where hate and ambition are the motives, with lying and violence the tools, to successful domination. The great religions of Buddhist, Catholic and “Red” are all in it. How the faith of many must be shaken! What a wonderful opportunity and privilege for those who are there and know the truth! Over the last twelve months the one congregation and missionary group have been doing a fine work, with some good results—four new publishers being started in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A person had been contacted about three years ago, but because of no progress the call was abandoned until this year, when I called back for renewals for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. When I made the call the man already had the renewal slips all filled out, plus four other new subscriptions he had obtained from his friends. This man is a great reader of religious books, including the Bible. A few years ago he had written to every Bible society he could find, including the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, asking for a certain translation of the Bible. He has gone to the Catholic church with no satisfaction. He then tried some Protestant churches, including the Baptist and Evangelist, but had not found what he was searching for. He said that from the reading of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">he has found out that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones that stick closely to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When I made the call, he told me that he had read in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine about a personal home Bible study and he was wondering if it was possible to arrange one in his home for him and his family. A study was immediately started and continued weekly thereafter. Each week he invites new ones to join the study, so that regularly we have five or six persons, representing Catholics, Buddhists and Protestants. From time to time some of his friends fail to come to the study, but that does not discourage him. He continues to study, talks to others about what he has learned, and is making good progress. His comment on seeing the film “Everlasting Good News” was: “Jehovah certainly got much praise tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;794,624</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,743 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 456</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Speaking the word of God with boldness” has been the determination of Jehovah’s witnesses in Trinidad and throughout all the world. This spirit is essential in the lives of Christians, and even though the majority of people on the continents of the earth and in the islands of the sea do not give an ear to hear, still with persistence, kindness and love the word of God must be spoken. The command is clear that followers of Christ should disciple people of all nations. So it has been in the islands of Trinidad, Barbados, Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago. Here are some experiences from each island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Children are capable of taking a firm stand for the truth, with good results. A special pioneer studied with a mother and daughter. The little girl soon began coming to the congregation meetings. Being a Roman Catholic, she attended a Catholic school. When the time came for her to be confirmed, she refused. Even her mother tried to get her to comply, but to no avail. She continued in regular meeting attendance in spite of the fact that much study was required for an important exam that was approaching. The result: She was first in her school and won a scholarship to attend a nondenominational school to complete her schooling. All this convinced the mother that it was really right to seek Kingdom interests first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes one who has served Jehovah for a time becomes inactive. The Society has suggested that such ones be visited and studied with in an attempt to revive them to spiritual health and activity. A special pioneer can testify that this is the way of practical wisdom. A brother and his wife who had been inactive for nine years moved into this congregation’s territory. Acting on the Society’s advice, the special pioneer called at their home and offered to start a study with them and their ten children. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World</span><span class="font4"> was the study material. In four months the parents and the three oldest children had become zealous publishers. The father arranged to take out the next two children in the service, and during August both he and his wife vacation pioneered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Family responsibility properly discharged brings blessings, as illustrated by this mother of seven children. She is left almost entirely alone to take care of the children, since her husband is ill. This is how she relates it: “I realize that their spiritual welfare is most important, so I try to keep up with every arrangement made by the Society. When the new Ministry School schedule came out we welcomed it, but how could we get all that Bible reading into one already tight schedule? Well, I decided to put first things first; so, getting the children together, we decided to rise a little earlier mornings and spend at least a half hour reading the Bible. In that way we are always ahead of the congregation. Later on we divided the time between the Bible and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> some mornings, so it is possible to keep up with this too.” Other publications are studied evenings. In this family two of the girls symbolized their dedication in 1962 and have vacation pioneered the last three years. One of these is now a regular pioneer. Three of the other children have been immersed in the meantime, and two of these have also vacation pioneered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BARBADOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;238,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 690 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 345</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The value of applying counsel received at assemblies is shown by the experience of a sister with an opposed husband. When the sister, new in the truth, took a firm stand, her husband sent her and her daughter to England, saying: “I have had enough of you.” No financial assistance was provided by the husband, who rarely corresponded with his wife. The sister managed to get a good job and did well. After a year and a half, the husband sent for his wife and daughter to return. Should she do so now that she was happy and well established? She attended the circuit assembly and heard the discussion on wives being in subjection to their husbands, and decided to return. She was very tactful with her still opposed husband and went in the service at times he was not present. In the mornings she would read the text to her daughter, and he occasionally listened. Gradually his interest began to manifest itself, and he would ask for the text if it was not read. He attended the public talk at the district assembly and was much impressed. Now, after seven years from the sister’s baptism, her husband has a regular Bible study conducted with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Getting part-time work is a great problem for those who would like to be regular pioneers. One alert brother remembered the article in the November 8, 1960, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> “Create Your Own Part-Time Job.” While doing street work he placed two magazines with a Venezuelan. The man returned again for two more magazines and was attracted by the brother’s friendliness. In conversation he asked if the brother knew anyone who could help him learn the English language faster. The brother did—himself! Not only did he help this person, but he was, in turn, introduced to other students who came to him for lessons in English. This afforded the brother part-time work for several months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant writes about how making calls the same day pays off. He called back the same day on a lady who showed great interest and handed over the resulting study to a local publisher. At his next visit a meeting for service had been arranged at her home, but not one publisher came that day. The lady felt regret that the circuit servant should go alone. She responded to his words of encouragement to come along and see how the work is done and quickly got ready. Ever since then she has been a regular publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQUIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This year the special pioneer couple and two others arranged to work some isolated territory, the little island of Cannouan, which has about six hundred inhabitants. Four days were spent in the service there. Three public talks were given in a schoolhouse, with a study in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> following the Sunday talk. There was an attendance of forty-five persons to study “The Unity of God’s Family.” After observing how the brothers raised their hands to comment on the questions, some of the more interested ones did likewise. When the conductor asked: “How are some hindered from coming to unity?” one answered, “Bad mind,” another, “Lack of love.” Because of the fertile prospects located, the special pioneer brother has arranged to visit Cannouan one week each month to try to build up and organize the interest found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This pioneer reports that, even though the people are extremely poor in his assignment, he has been able to increase his placements by barter. One vegetable vendor took a number of publications over a period of time and gave vegetables in place of money for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,766</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Faithfulness in meeting attendance and one’s personal ministry is required of all Jehovah’s servants and can be shown even under trying circumstances. One brother who is a cripple puts forth a real effort to attend the meetings, a mile away from his home. He can hardly walk and moves about by taking hold of stationary objects. To get to the meetings he uses his donkey. To get up and down from the donkey he has to pull the animal a few feet up the steps of a building. Then the brother can slide down over the head and neck of the donkey. It is a real ordeal for him to get on and off, but appreciation for the meetings moves him to overcome any physical discomfort. Despite the fact that he is unable to go from house to house, he averages about twenty hours in the service each month. He does most of his preaching by speaking to persons who come to get groceries from his shop. He even conducts a study at his shop. Certainly, his zeal and faith have been a source of enjoyment and encouragement to the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GRENADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,034</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A bright spot in the year was the dedication of the new Kingdom Hall in St. George’s on March 7, during the visit of the zone servant. For months much hard work had been done on the hall by brothers from all the congregations at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Vacation pioneering has increased this year, with interesting experiences and blessings for those sharing in it, resulting in further privileges for one vacation pioneer, who writes: “While doing house-to-house work as a vacation pioneer during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign, I obtained a subscription from a meek, elderly man. Thereupon, I took advantage of the opportunity to arrange for a return visit. However, he said he did not believe that I would return, because many Witnesses had visited him and promised to return but never did. I faithfully assured him that I would return.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This promise was kept and a study was started after a few back-calls. Soon he started to clean house, religiously speaking, and threw out pictures of Mary, phallic emblems, and so forth. After attending a few meetings at the Kingdom Hall and observing how the brothers conducted themselves, he admitted that he had found the truth at long last. His chief obstacle, being a member of a sacred lodge society, was finally overcome when he withdrew from it at a financial loss. Almost immediately he participated in the field service and was baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. LUCIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;86,194</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Here, as on the other islands, vacation pioneers increased this year. Those who arrange to be vacation pioneers are not always those in robust health; they are, however, strong in faith and in their desire to serve Jehovah. In recommending one sister, the committee stated that she had recently had a very serious operation and had refused a blood transfusion. Additionally, her husband and children were not in the truth. Would she be able to vacation pioneer for the month successfully? Her record speaks for itself! Her report for the month read: 8 books, 4 booklets, 105 hours, 1 subscription, 135 magazines, 45 back-calls, 4 Bible studies. Jehovah certainly blesses faithful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Problems and adjustments must be faced by those beginning a life of dedicated service to Jehovah. These can be successfully faced and overcome by those who are sincere and who pray for a solution to their problems. A publisher had a study in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book with an interested woman. When the chapter on “The Shepherd Brings ‘Other Sheep’ Together” was studied, she said she wanted to be one of the “other sheep” and so began attending all the meetings. She saw the need to go in the service but wondered how to clean up her life, since she was living with a man to whom she was not married. She feared she could not support herself if she separated from him. The publisher prayed with her for a solution. It so happened she had to have an operation and found herself abandoned by the man on her return home. Since she had survived the operation, she showed faith and made a dedication. She now is very active in the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is the Bible study work that produces Jehovah’s blessing of growth, but it takes perseverance and faithfully calling back on prospective “sheep,” patience like that of a farmer waiting for the harvest of his crops. (Jas. 5:7, 8) A brother started making back-calls on a couple who had been witnessed to many times and who thought that there were Christians in every religion and that they themselves were Christians. After many discussions from the Bible that convinced them of certain facts, they decided to see what the study would be like. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> was the publication used. From the very start they were surprised to learn that the fundamental religious doctrine of the Trinity is not found anywhere in the Scriptures. This got them interested in knowing more, for Jesus was right when he said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” They began to see the difference between true Christians and other religions. They realized that they not only were to be hearers of the Word but also must become doers. They were encouraged to make public declaration for salvation. They have done so and are now happy, dedicated proclaimers of the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The hurricane here opened the way for the publishers to show kindness to the public and to explain why such things occur. One publisher states that she had studied with a woman for some time, but she never saw the importance of the field ministry. When the publisher showed kindness by caring for her baby one day this surprised and pleased her; she said her relatives or neighbors would not have done so. After the hurricane destroyed her home, the publisher showed further kindness in assisting her. This convinced her that this was the true religion and, although opposed by her husband, she has begun to attend meetings and go in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Encouraging others to enter the pioneer service produces good results. A special pioneer decided to act, after the Society’s insert in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> on pioneering had been considered. Selecting the most promising publisher, he encouraged her in daily service and had short talks on pioneering with her. She was elderly and tried vacation pioneering first and was successful. With this good start she became a regular pioneer and has done well the last three months of the service year.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark175"></a>Progress was made in many ways in the South American country of Uruguay during the past year. Publishers increased in numbers. They have grown in knowledge and maturity. They have a greater sense of responsibility and they appreciate their spiritual needs. Those who entered the vacation pioneer work found it to be a great privilege of service, and while serving as a vacation pioneer one of the publishers was able to start three Bible studies, with ten persons attending each week. Experiences like this bring real happiness to a congregation publisher and keep him extremely busy during the rest of the year. Here are some interesting experiences that have taken place in Uruguay and in the Falkland Islands.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Love is a powerful force for breaking down opposition. In spite of his bitterly opposed wife, a store owner obtained a Bible and other literature and wanted to attend meetings. His wife was furious. During the siesta houi' on Sunday afternoon he quietly arose and went to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study without awakening his wife. When she awoke and could not find him, she hurriedly dressed their little daughter and rushed to the Kingdom Hall, determined to create a public scandal that would end his following this “new religion.” When she got to the hall, a friendly attendant helped her find a seat near her husband. On seeing so many happy people with a friendly spirit, she was unable to go through with her plans. After the meeting the Witnesses all crowded around to welcome her and express how happy they were that she had come to the meeting. She was deeply impressed with the sincere expressions of love of the brothers, something she had never seen before. Since then both she and her husband have become twenty-five-to thirty-hour-a-month publishers, having been baptized in December during Brother Henschel’s visit. Yes, the quality of love when put into practice is a powerful weapon against opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When people are too poor to contribute for literature, this need not be an obstacle. One special pioneer sister writes: “After I had given the sermon to a woman, she told me: ‘I would like to have that Bible but we are poor and do not have the money.’ I explained that we could trade. So I came away with a chicken, and she kept the Bible.” Placements are increased in this way, by putting into practice the suggestions in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A special pioneer going from house to house met a Mormon woman and arranged to call back. Her husband had questions about the doctrine involving differences of races. Soon they saw the difference between Mormon doctrine and the Bible truth, and the study progressed. Following the Society’s counsel to teach new ones about the organization after each study, the pioneer aided this woman to become a preacher within four months, and she reported nine hours the first month. On learning of the ten-hour-a-month goal for publishers, she arranged her household affairs to go in the service during the week to reach the goal. Often a publisher’s maturity depends on how well he is trained from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two special pioneer sisters were given an assignment of territory. They worked two days of each week in one of their isolated towns of 3,680 population. Within a few weeks they got ten studies established and are unable to care for all the back-calls on the people having interest in the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From March through May a missionary couple worked in the Falkland Islands. From the moment they boarded the ship at Montevideo they began to witness to passengers as opportunity afforded. One English couple enjoyed the information so much that they continued to study after settling in the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the more advanced publishers of previous years have moved away, nevertheless, visits were made on new people who had shown interest and some progress was made this year. While many see the hypocrisy of the three principal false religions of the islands, yet it is difficult for them to break away and take a definite stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The missionaries were able to send magazines, literature and letters to the outlying settlements and other islands, some even reaching to the South Georgia whaling station and bases at Antarctica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VENEZUELA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,503,118</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the past year the brothers in Venezuela have tried hard to walk worthily of Jehovah, having in mind the scripture: “Be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work.” (Col. 1: 9, 10) Every effort was put forth to let accurate knowledge be known to others, and during the year 273 persons were baptized and much interest has been shown in the Word of God due to the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Here are some experiences as sent in by the Venezuelan branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another pioneer tells us this experience of how various persons came to an accurate knowledge of the truth: “One day when working from house to house I met a young girl in a dry-cleaning place. She took two magazines but seemed pretty set in her way of thinking. She had come here from the Canary Islands and had not found life as happy as she had hoped. On my return visit she was rather difficult to talk to and told me I should talk to her aunt because she was more religious. She did ask me to leave her the Bible, as she had never read one. I visited her aunt and, although she was very Catholic, we had some lively discussions. After about six weeks a study was started with both the niece and the aunt. In a short while my husband was able to start a study with this lady’s husband and son. After a few months some startling changes took place. First was the manner of dress of the lady. For sixteen years she had worn brown to fulfill a promise made to the Virgin of Carmen always to wear that color, but now she would greet us in all different colors of dresses. The second big change was their bedroom. On my early visits she was proud to show me her private altar with different statues and images with lots of lights and also a ‘saint’ over her bed. It was during a circuit assembly that all was changed. She attended on Friday but not the other days. However, on that Sunday she decided to clear her bedroom of religious objects. The lady continued to progress and, after seven months of studying, went out in the service and, some months later, the niece did also. In the meantime the niece married and her husband is also studying the Bible. He had examined ‘higher learning’ and literature of many different religions. The aunt was baptized in May and is now inquiring about pioneering. The son has participated in the service and will be baptized at the next circuit assembly. They are all regular attenders at all the meetings. She is so thankful to Jehovah to be freed from the heavy weight of religious tradition she was carrying and expresses her happiness in the service of Jehovah regularly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A circuit servant writes the following: “Some time ago a publisher in an adjacent circuit started a study with a neighbor of his. This man played in an orchestra in a restaurant. Soon he began to talk to others and attend the meetings. He had conversations especially with a piano player who worked in another restaurant close by. The piano player became very interested in the Bible message and accepted magazines and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book. Then one day he asked why someone did not call on him and study with him in his home. He lived over on the other side of the city in another circuit. The first musician gave the name and address of the piano player to the brother who was studying with him and he passed it on to the branch office, and in the course of time it was passed on to me. I called on him the next time I visited the congregation in whose territory he lived. He was very glad to see me and took the subscriptions for the two magazines and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'Let God Be True’</span><span class="font4"> book. He wanted to study, so I mentioned that he should come to the Kingdom Hall on Sunday and hear the talk and I would introduce him to the brother who conducted the congregation study near his home and they could make arrangements. Sunday he was there and the arrangements were made. Later the piano player talked to a good friend of his who played in the same orchestra. He, in turn, started to talk to his wife, who is, or was, very Catholic. She did not like it at all and threatened to go to the priest, which was all very well with the man. She went to the priest and told him her husband was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest said that was very bad and loaned the lady a Bible and told her to open it and read it to her husband every time he started to talk about Jehovah’s witnesses and their teaching. She really felt comforted now and followed the priest’s advice. Of course, the husband did not mind at all and it was not too long until the wife read a few things in the Bible that just did not agree with her Catholic faith. Then with curiosity she began to read the Bible avidly (when the husband was not at home). The more she read the angrier she got. In fact, she became so angry she took down all her ‘saints’ and destroyed them, because her anger was not directed at the Bible but at the priest and herself for having allowed herself to be fooled for so long. Now she studies and goes to the Kingdom Hall regularly. The piano player has showed very good progress and is now baptized and a servant in the congregation. In whatever restaurant the orchestra plays it is not long until all the waiters and other employees get a witness, and much literature is thus placed that never would be otherwise due to the inaccessibility of these people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom is going ahead well in the communistic country of Yugoslavia. Our brothers make use of the existing possibilities and they are pleased to have at their disposal a good number of publications in their languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How funeral talks can result in a witness that bears rich fruit is well illustrated in the following experience. An elderly man in a small town got acquainted with the truth. A Bible study was conducted with him for about four years, but he did not make much progress, as his town is strongly Catholic. Then one day this man had an accident and died. The nearby congregation came to the funeral and a brother gave the talk. Many from the town attended the funeral. After the talk some of those in attendance had questions, and so the brothers started witnessing to many. All together, seventy booklets were placed at the funeral. As a result of this, the congregation received several letters from people who asked to be visited. Each Sunday now the congregation makes back-calls on these interested persons. Today there exists a study group of eight persons who meet regularly. Even the brother of the man who died is among them. When his brother was living, he was opposed to the truth, but the funeral witness had changed his mind. Now he even offered a room in his house for the meetings. Very likely he will become the congregation servant there, when a congregation can be formed. Indeed, a funeral service did bear fruit! When still alive this elderly man could do nothing for the truth, the ground being considered too hard, but his death softened their hearts and brought people in touch with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a rural village a sister went to some houses to buy eggs. In one instance she was invited to enter the house. There she saw the daughter of the family, a girl of twenty years, lame since birth, who could merely sit, but not walk. The sister started to give a witness and pointed out that all disease will end in God’s new order now near. The girl listened very attentively and then accepted three booklets and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font4"> book. She also asked the sister to come again next week, since she wanted to know more about this message. The next week when the sister came to see her, the girl had tears of joy in her eyes and said: “Indeed, it was Jehovah who sent you to me!” The girl asked the sister to bring her a Bible. A Bible study was started, and every time the sister came for the study she had to bring twenty booklets with her. The sister asked how the girl could place all these booklets, and the girl replied: “I am inviting all my friends to come and visit me and to each one I give a witness, and they accept the booklets; and I have already a good number of interested ones.” When the girl learned that there was to be a circuit assembly, she asked her mother on the day the assembly began to hitch the horses to the carriage and take her to the assembly, about eighteen kilometers away. There she was immersed. She told the audience: “Jehovah knows that I cannot walk and so he sends many persons to me to whom I can witness, and they take literature with them. In this way I also am able to serve him.” Indeed, disability does not necessarily hinder a person from preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ELEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 104,597 Population: 420,365,600 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,019</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses have found themselves during the past year they all had in mind the text for the year, “Filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:31) Sometimes it takes greater boldness in order to preach the good news of the Kingdom, especially when one lives in a country behind the Iron Curtain, or in a country where the persecution is very heavy. It seems, too, that it is then that Jehovah God gives abundantly of his holy spirit, his active force, to back up his people in their boldness. It takes us back to the days when Peter and John showed boldness, as recorded in Acts, chapters three and four. In those early days of Christianity the religious leaders and the political powers were trying to stop the declaration of the good news of God’s kingdom, which Jesus taught his disciples to look for and pray for. But, as they could not stop it in those early days, so it is today. They may have killed some followers of Christ and destroyed their bodies, but they could not destroy the souls of such faithful ones. Jehovah God has in memory those who are faithfully serving him, and we know of the promised resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today Jehovah’s Christian witnesses do not hesitate to push on under adversity, and the experiences that follow should be most encouraging to all Christians. A Christian must let his light shine, not just in favorable season, but also in the unfavorable seasons. Today throughout this world of ours there are many places where the season for preaching the good news of God’s kingdom is very unfavorable. Still, it is being preached and we all rejoice in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have no record of house-to-house witnessing in Albania for the 1964 service year. However, the truth has been spoken despite the worsening conditions in this country. Our brothers there have faced persecution and it has increased considerably during the past twelve months. A number of brothers have been arrested because they are Jehovah’s witnesses and because they have spoken about God’s Word. Some have been sent to labor camps, and when this happens no provisions are made to take care of their families, their wives and children. Those who remain behind are helped by others, and in this way they show their faithfulness to God by providing what assistance is necessary for those persons whose husbands are in prison. One can imagine how difficult it is to carry on Bible studies, because if you are known to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses you are under strict surveillance. In some places Bible studies cannot be held. The only thing one can do is read privately and speak only with trusted brothers or sisters. We continue to pray to our Father in heaven for his blessing to be upon these fellow workers of ours and to strengthen our brothers and sisters in Albania during these most difficult times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Long ago the prophet Amos foretold that days would come when Jehovah would send a hunger and thirst into the land, not for bread and water, but for hearing his word. (Amos 8:11) It can be said that this situation exists in Bulgaria. The clergy have left the people undernourished spiritually. Therefore, honest men are looking for something better and some get it through Jehovah’s witnesses. The work cannot be carried out officially due to the Communist rule, which does not shrink back from putting people in prison for spreading the good news of God’s kingdom. Some good work, however, is being accomplished by a few brothers and they do their best under the circumstances. As </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> result, truth-seeking persons grow in knowledge, maturity and firmness for the truth and separate themselves from the world. They know that in God’s due time their deliverance will come and that only one thing counts now: to be faithful to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Honest people in all walks of life have made a dedication to Jehovah God, and this is true in Czechoslovakia. There were a goodly number immersed last year and the organization is growing steadily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are sent to “bind up the brokenhearted.” (Isa. 61:1) This is fittingly illustrated in the following experience. In a village a young man tragically lost his life, so that his mother and sister were in deep grief. Jehovah’s witnesses living in that village decided to comfort these mourning persons. The publisher writes: “At the funeral I addressed the girl at the grave of her brother. She told me the circumstances of his death, opened her heart to me, and said how deeply she was grieved whenever she thought that her brother was being tortured in everlasting fire. In her despair she even wanted to commit suicide in order to be near him. My words of consolation started to cheer her up, and she accepted my offer to visit her at home and read from the Bible the good news about the state of the dead and about the resurrection in God’s new order. Since that time I have been conducting a Bible study with the girl and her mother. Their grief has turned into joy. The girl has become active herself in the service, in that she conducts a Bible study with her sister and she looks forward to being immersed at the next opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How often incidental witnessing has brought results! It should never be neglected, because it may be that we will find a prospective “sheep” this way, as is shown by this experience. It was in a public park. A couple were sitting there while the woman rested her sore foot. An elderly brother went by and a conversation developed. The brother promised the lady that he would bring her a good medicament for her foot, which he did. The brother then visited the couple at home. He brought not only the promised medicament, but also spiritual healing, the message of Jehovah’s kingdom; and he showed them from the Bible how all affliction and sickness will come to an early end in the paradise on earth. The brother then made regular calls for about two months, because he had observed that there was some interest on the part of these persons. After that the couple moved to a nearby town, but the woman’s interest caused her to look for Jehovah’s witnesses until she found them. So the study was continued and it led to her dedication and immersion. The husband likewise has now become interested in the truth and he in no way hinders his wife from associating with the brothers. It shows how a simple conversation concerning a sore foot can result in making disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witnesses of Jehovah in East Germany are very closely watched by the Communist authorities, but there has been comparatively little direct interference during the past year. There are about seventy of Jehovah’s witnesses incarcerated in East German prisons. Only nine new arrests were reported during the year, while forty-eight persons were released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just at the close of the year four brothers who had been incarcerated since 1950 were released to West Germany. Two of these brothers were members of the Bethel family in Magdeburg, the other two were a congregation servant and a general pioneer. They had been given life terms when they were tried in court by the Communists, but these terms were later commuted to fifteen years in the penitentiary. They had been residents of East Germany, and generally the East German authorities prevent residents who want to go to West Germany from doing so, even to the point of machinegunning any who try to jump the demarcation line, but these four brothers in a surprise move were officially released to West Germany. They were told that their organization had requested them. Our last request made for the release of Jehovah’s witnesses imprisoned by the Communists was the worldwide resolution to the government of the Soviet Union adopted in 1956-1957.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These four brothers had been incarcerated during the time of the Nazi regime and had spent a total of up to twenty-three years in prison on account of the truth. What a wonderful record of faith in Jehovah and his way of deliverance this has been! They never thought of being able to get to West Germany and be together with their brothers at big conventions and see the organization operating “above ground,” and now more than their boldest dreams have come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The husband of one sister was a policeman. It was suggested to him to get separated from his wife or else he would lose his job. Although not a Witness himself, he did not want to desert his wife. He said that she never neglected him because of her religion, but she always had been a good wife to him. As a result, he lost his job and now works as a doorkeeper, earning just half what he previously got paid. His wife hopes that he will someday learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man had made good progress in learning the truth by means of a home Bible study, but he still was a member of the Communist party. Before long he sent a letter concerning his withdrawal from the party, informing them of his views. A meeting was called in his workshop and his statements were discussed in public. A functionary said that only Jehovah’s witnesses are such Christians, but there is no way to withdraw from the party, only to be expelled from it. The interested person willingly took the whole treatment. He was expelled, and now he is happy to be free to serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One day a sister took an interested lady out in the service. Calling at one door, they were invited inside and were able to give a good witness to a young woman. They noticed that a man came into the room, listened a little and then hastily left the house. The sister felt that there was some danger coming. She quickly concluded her witness and they left the house too. They went to the market square, which was right in the neighborhood, and sat down on a wooden bench. From there they observed the young man coming along with two policemen excitedly talking to them. They separated and searched the streets, passing by the bench just a few feet distant. The interested lady had taken off her overcoat and so they looked different. They calmly remained seated on the bench. Two hours later they left unharmed for another town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many publishers took up vacation pioneering, seeing the urgency of the time and that many people are just waiting for the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A married couple set out on vacation pioneering with their two children. They worked in two pairs, with one parent and one child together. The children were able to give short sermons too. They met a Catholic woman who had seen a program from the Munich convention on West German television, which the people are not supposed to watch. She noticed how well Jehovah’s witnesses were able to preach with their Bible. Not having a Bible herself, she was very happy that the Witnesses called at her home. A back-call was made, a Bible placed with her, and she now enjoys a regular Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a vacation pioneer was picked up by the police, he was formally expelled from the town where he had been witnessing. He made up his mind to continue speaking the Word of God with boldness. The next day he fearlessly went into a neighboring town. He found much interest. At one door he preached to a young woman. Her father listened in and said to her: “Get hold of the opportunity. This man has been sent by God.” At once he was able to start a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much faithful work has been accomplished by the Kingdom publishers in Ethiopia and in the province of Eritrea during the past service year. In many respects it has been a most progressive service year, blessed by Jehovah.—Prov. 10:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite intensified opposition from the local priests and authorities until approximately the middle of the year, a real effort was put forth to reach interested persons: a new territory was opened up and many new Bible studies were started. The local priests have been the main troublemakers. Some months ago they passed a resolution of excommunication of Jehovah’s witnesses before a crowd of more than 20,000 who were gathered to celebrate the “Baptismal Feast.” The crowd was very curious as to what the priests were saying against Jehovah’s witnesses. The chief priest broadcast the resolution to the adherents of the Orthodox Church, telling them that they should not greet Jehovah’s witnesses, should not give them employment, should not bury their dead, and so forth. After this announcement a friendly person wanted to pay her respects to a family in which there had been a recent death. As is the local custom she took with her a basket of good things to eat. She was immediately turned away, as the people did not want anything to do with one of Jehovah’s witnesses or any of their associates. Another brother and his wife wished to attend the funeral of a relative and proceeded to ride the bus that was taking the relatives and friends to the funeral. They were told to get off the bus, so were unable to attend the funeral as they had no other means of transportation. In addition to this a brother was falsely accused of insulting the Orthodox Church and was sentenced to jail for three months. The brothers have been told to renounce their faith; otherwise they would be fired from their jobs and later prosecuted. Some have been imprisoned and many threatened by police. The newspaper, radio and other means were used to blaspheme Jehovah’s people and misrepresent the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the face of these charges, accusations and persecution the brothers have been courageous in harmony with the year’s text. Persecution did not slacken their service, neither did it stop them from faithfully worshiping the Almighty God. Many honest-hearted persons became curious about the integrity of the Witnesses and at the same time condemned their own leaders. Some did not care what the resolution had said. One person said to a brother: “I am going to eat in your house and I shall see what they will do.” Another one said: “These priests are causing trouble so that they might get favors from the Government. Otherwise, do you think they are doing it for the sake of the church?” Another comment about Jehovah’s people was: “They don’t drink, they don’t steal, they don’t get angry easily.” Many favorable comments were made by the local people, showing that many of them are peace-loving and friendly; and we hope that many of these persons can be fed with the knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brothers in this distant area have taken comfort in the words of Gamaliel at Acts 5:39: “(But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them;) otherwise you may perhaps be found fighters actually against God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After a period of relative peace, the brothers in Hungary experienced a wave of difficulties again. Many homes were searched and dozens of brothers had to undergo hearings. All this, however, did not stop the growth of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the Communist government does not favor Jehovah’s witnesses, these Witnesses are good workers in their secular jobs and thus create a good impression. In one village two brothers went preaching from house to house, but they were watched by a policeman who took them to the police station. Their Bibles were taken away and a record was drawn up. The police even found a copy of a typewritten article of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in one Bible, and that made matters even worse. It just happened that a higher police officer was in the police station and he demanded that the brothers be brought to the police headquarters, saying that these men were lazy people who do not want to work, but instead go from house to house wasting their time and that of others too. At this point the local police officer intervened. He had got information from the production cooperative society where the two brothers work, and he was told they were the best workers in the cooperative society. So then the two police officers argued with each other. As a result, the record about the case was torn apart and thrown away, and the brothers were released. Some days later the brothers also received their Bibles back and the police officer presented his apology for the interference. He merely advised the brothers to be more cautious in the future in their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes it takes much time and patience until honest people leave Babylon the Great. “Send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.” (Eccl. 11:1) A sister in the truth witnessed to her mother, a very devout Catholic. But the mother did not want to hear, and she even threatened to break every family tie. The two lived quite distant from each other and so they only had contact by exchanging letters. Time and again the daughter wrote her about the truth and invited the mother to check the texts in her Bible. But the mother replied that it hurt her so much that the daughter had left the “glorious Catholic religion” and that she would pray and fast so that the daughter might return to the Catholic Church. The daughter, on her part, prayed to the one living God Jehovah, asking him to be merciful with the mother and open her eyes, provided she was sincere of heart. Six full years this lasted. But then a letter came from the mother. She had changed and she expressed the desire to spend the rest of her life with the daughter! She had turned her back on the Catholic Church. Living with the daughter, she attended the meetings. At the end of the first study she said: “Until now I have drunk the dirty waters and now I thirst for the fresh waters of truth.” After a period of zealous study, she got baptized and she now shares in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the long-time ban on our work, the brothers in Poland have been speaking the Word of God with boldness during the past year. Many people have been reached with the message, although the authorities have put forth much effort to curb our activity. When publishers are reported to the police while out in the preaching work, they are taken to the police station where their personal data are noted down and an investigation is made into their activity. They are kept under arrest for a few hours or maybe one or two days, but then released without any charge filed against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers point out to the officials that the law provides for freedom of worship for all citizens, which includes the right to talk to other people about one’s faith, and that it is lawful to publish God’s Word. The officials, as a rule, acknowledge this and let the publishers go, but some, although being Communists, are religiously biased from the time of their youth and they act more violently. Often the publishers hear them say: “We are going to make it hard for you!” But the publishers are not frightened by it. They just change over to another territory, and the officials have come to realize that they cannot stop them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young man was convinced that there were many like him among the Roman Catholic population who were taking their religion seriously and that he did not need anything else. The publisher invited him to accompany him in his preaching work from house to house, in order to observe for himself how little good their religion had done for the people and that there was a widespread lack of faith. Next Sunday he went along. The first householder bluntly told them that he did not have any faith left after he had observed the conduct of the clergy. In another home the young householder grabbed a sausage from the table and said: “This is my kingdom.” At another door a man told them that he had just returned from church. When the publisher commended him for showing interest in God’s Word, he replied that it was just because of his neighbors that he went to church. This experience was so forceful that the young man gave up his objections, and the publisher was able to start a Bible study with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some time ago the secretary of the Communist party in one town came into the truth. His position was given to two other people, but these proved to be quite inactive. One year later a meeting of all the party members was called. When they were questioned as to why there was no activity, each one of them had an excuse. They were asked whether their former secretary had influenced them, but they had not seen him during all that time. The meeting ended with the decision that the local party organization was to be disbanded. But the town now had a ministerial service center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cultivating the fruits of the spirit sometimes speaks louder than many words. A woman had </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> home Bible study; but when her husband learned of it, he became very much opposed. She was treated harshly by him, but she endured. In due course she became a publisher. He too is a zealous publisher today. What had happened? The conduct of his wife and of those who called on her made a deep impression upon him. Often he would listen secretly to overhear what they were talking about. His wife once complained to the publisher about his bad treatment of her. But the publisher told her that, nevertheless, she ought to endeavor to be a good wife to him. And so she did. When the next back-call was made, he was present also and had a lot of questions. He did not miss a study thereafter, and that helped him to make rapid progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One should never feel that talking the truth to someone is useless if he does not agree at once. A publisher made a back-call on an interested couple. A young man who happened to be present was an outspoken atheist. The publisher had to change his presentation to refute the visitor’s arguments. He proved the existence of God, his creative works, his care for his creatures and explained his purpose, but apparently to no avail, as the atheist clung to&quot; his theories right to the end of the discussion. But he asked for another discussion with the brother, which he had. He obtained a Bible and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font4"> and completely changed his ideas. His workmates are wondering what made this avowed atheist become a publisher of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brothers in Romania look back over many years of oppression and trials. In all these years, hundreds of brothers were arrested and sentenced to jail, many for a long period of time, merely because they read the Bible, preached its Kingdom message and lived according to it. And yet, by Jehovah’s strength, they have endured these tests and persevered. They have not given up the task of making disciples and so God’s people have grown in oppressive Romania also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By their faithful stand they have honored Jehovah and shown themselves to be subjects of a higher and more powerful government than any other. Political prisoners who were released from prison and who left Romania for the West have testified to this fact. It was reported that the brothers in prison formed small groups and every day they discussed Biblical subjects, with different ones giving short talks, in order to keep alive spiritually. They became known in the prisons for their uncompromising attitude. Said a political prisoner: “They are a fine class of people, and they would not give in and renounce their religion, while the priests of the Orthodox Church and others were always prepared to compromise.” Speaking of the prison he was in, the same man said: “Jehovah’s witnesses were the most liked prisoners in the place.” It all shows that, wherever they are, God’s true servants have to behave as such and follow a course that will prove to be a blessing even to their enemies, provided they are sincere. “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you; that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens.” (Matt. 5:44, 45) As a result of the preaching and good conduct in the prisons, quite a few prisoners have become interested in the truth, and among them are to be found educated men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In keeping with the new political course taken by the Romanian government, thousands of political prisoners were released in 1964. The amnesty was also applied to Jehovah’s witnesses, although they are not political prisoners. So it seems that by the latter part of 1964 most of our brothers, if not all, were freed and could join their families. It remains to be seen whether there will be less pressure on Jehovah’s people in that land in the future. Whatever will be the situation, our true brothers will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> abandon their God-given commission to preach, but will stand together shoulder to shoulder, as one united family in the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the increase in publishers was not so great as in former years, still Jehovah’s witnesses have faithfully continued preaching the everlasting good news, and the organization has continued to grow despite the difficulties that have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The legal case concerning twenty-seven persons in Ankara who were arrested at a gathering on April 8, 1962, was finally decided June 17, 1964, and all persons involved were acquitted. The court had asked for a report by law experts and had submitted some of the confiscated literature to them. The report, made out by three professors of the law faculty of the university, was very favorable and stated that ‘the system of religious thought called Jehovah’s witnesses constitutes an independent religion,’ and that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses, by being persons who are united under a distinct aim, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font4"> constitute </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> society and are so under the guarantee of the Turkish constitution.’ The committee wrote that the fact of establishing a religion is not enough reason for punishment so long as there is no violation of paragraph 163 of the Turkish Criminal Code, which prohibits using religious influence to interfere in politics, and that in the case of Jehovah’s witnesses nothing had been found that violates this paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the end of the previous service year a brother was arrested after having been shadowed closely by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">police for several months, because ‘he walked around with the Bible under his arm and made religious propaganda.’ After having spent more than four weeks in prison, he was finally handed over to the law court, which acquitted him on December 3, 1963, and returned the confiscated books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are certainly thankful to Jehovah for his protection. We appreciate, too, that these courts gave their decisions in favor of freedom of worship and defended the right of citizens to gather together to enjoy companionship and to speak to others about their hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After one’s having found interest, even if it seems to be very little, persistence is needed to make return calls. A brother called on a young lady and gave the current sermon. Although she listened, it seemed that she was not much interested. The publisher went to the neighbor, but this woman was strongly opposed and did not even listen to the sermon. But the brother asked a sister to call back on the first lady. After several calls when she was always busy, the sister was finally able to give a back-call sermon, and a Bible study was started. But what changed the attitude of the lady so that she invited the sister in? She said that after the first visit of the brother her neighbor came and complained about Jehovah’s witnesses, that they go around to disturb the people. She asked: “Do you know their message, did you listen?” “No,” the neighbor replied, “I am not interested to know as I am a good Catholic.” The young lady could not understand such an attitude and therefore was eager to learn about Jehovah’s witnesses, though being a Catholic too. Now her husband also participates in the study and both are eager to learn the truth. One day the lady confessed: “We are very happy that our neighbor through her foolish attitude helped us to listen to the good news.” Besides this, it was the persistence on the part of the publisher to make a back-call even where not much interest seemed to exist that led to the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this country the conditions for true Christians in a way resemble those that prevailed in the Roman Empire during the first century. Despite the increased effort of the authorities to prevent the spreading of the everlasting good news, new people show up here and there, identifying themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses and trying to comfort the people living in their neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As regards the persecution by the authorities and the attitude of the atheistic population, there has been little change from the previous service year. The spirit and faith of the publishers, however, have become stronger because Jehovah has led them his spiritual food regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers have to be very careful. They are kept under constant surveillance. They have to live under great pressure and, were it not for Jehovah’s power, they could not stand it much longer. As the apostle Paul said: “However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves. We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.”—2 Cor. 4:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the start of the new service year the enemy set out with some repressive measures. In several places faithful brothers were arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a very easy matter to be picked up and get into such a penal camp. A publisher was happy that he found a new person in his territory who was interested in the message, and they began to study the Bible. After the study had been going on for some time, the publisher brought along a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">magazine for studying. Thereupon the “interested” person gave him away to the police and he even stood up as a witness against the brother who was sentenced to five years in prison for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In most instances, it is not possible to call on the people in their homes and start talking to them about the Bible. The publishers would not last very long before getting arrested and put in jail. Nevertheless, new people are contacted. For instance, the publishers listen to what people are talking about and as soon as they hear someone even slightly referring to the Bible, they try to get acquainted with that person and then gradually start preaching to him. Also, the cemeteries are a good territory when they see people who are really mourning for their dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is one penal camp in which there are more than 250 brothers. Although they have to go through many hardships, they are strong spiritually. The brothers in camp look at it like attending a special school where they learn to become more mature and strong in the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another camp there are more than twenty brothers together. During the daytime they have to work outside under the eyes of guards on the construction of houses, in the fields and clearing woods. Although the authorities try to undermine their faith, sending officials who want to induce them to compromise, they are confident that Jehovah will continue to strengthen them to withstand all these attacks of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are witnesses of Jehovah in those camps who are there for the second or third time, as they did not stop preaching the message after they were released. Others learned the truth while in such a camp for some other matter. They got immersed, were released and some time later were arrested again and sentenced to a prison term, but now on account of the truth. Still others were even given additional prison terms in the camps because they had been found preaching in the camps. But all of them rejoice, like the first Christians, because they “had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A publisher who had carried on Bible studies with several interested people was arrested and brought to trial. Some became afraid when put under pressure and gave in to testify as witnesses against him in court. The authorities became so sure of their success that they also summoned as witnesses the other people with whom the brother had been studying. These had been steadfast when they were interrogated by the police, but the whole atmosphere in the courtroom would certainly weaken their knees and loosen their tongues too. When they were called in to testify, their answers were in effect: “You are judging an innocent man; he did nothing wicked, as he spoke of God’s Word to us.” The judge tried to frighten them, but they stood their ground. He could not do anything else but order them out of the courtroom. The brother was given a long prison term. But seeing these young ones take their stand in court was a wonderful thing to him, showing that his labor had not been in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very often when a person has a hearing ear, his family members are opposed to the message. A brother had to carry on his Bible studies in the open air at some inconspicuous place. On icy winter days they had to be out in the streets for more than an hour, there praying to Jehovah and discussing his Word. Nevertheless, people learn the truth that way too, and four of these persons he studied with out in the streets are today publishers of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fantastic story labeling Jehovah’s witnesses as agents of the American intelligence service was published in the Minsk paper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bielorussia Sovietica on</span><span class="font4"> July 22, 1964. Foreign tourists were accused of attempting to smuggle religious items into the Soviet Union. They were said to have carried icons and religious medallions packed in pornographic material in addition to Bibles and religious, anti-Soviet books published by the CIA and State Department. The accused were said to have explicitly referred to “Jehovah’s witnesses.” The paper continued to say about their religious literature that they were handling an ideological weapon no less dangerous than a firearm directed against the Soviet people. Of course, most people can see the lie sticking out, because they know very well that Jehovah’s witnesses have no use for icons, medallions and pornographic literature. But it is enlightening to note that the Communists are so afraid of Bible truths that they even compare them with firearms. God’s Word really is a “two-edged sword” to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This testifies to the fact that the same spirit of Jehovah that was with the true Christians of the first century is today also with his people in this country behind the Iron Curtain. It helps his servants to withstand the attacks by the enemy and to guard their Christian integrity despite strong endeavors to topple their faith. The proclaiming of the everlasting good news has not been silenced even by fierce persecution. The fresh food from God’s table is very strengthening to us and we are very thankful for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of the service year that has just passed we were more than any time before “pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; . . . perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out.”—2 Cor. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had to fight very hard in order to speak the Word of God with boldness to the U.A.R. people as well as to the local “superior authorities.” This time the propaganda against our work was more organized than ever. It had a very special tone because it seemed to be initiated by Moslem newspaper reporters or army officers. The Cairo radio broadcasting station as well as television and newspapers were charging us with being Zionists and anti-Arab. A congregation publisher against whom a court case was started in 1962 with the accusation that he was preaching the good news of God’s kingdom was convicted and imprisoned. Others were arrested for the same reason, and one of them was savagely beaten to get him to renounce his faith and stop his ministerial activities. Although some of the brothers did not stick to their Christian neutrality as far as the politics of this world are concerned, the great majority continued to keep their integrity and, by conducting themselves worthily of the good news, helped many persons to see the difference between false Christians and the true ones. The following experiences illustrate this very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A couple of years ago a druggist obtained some of the Society’s books, but did not show great interest in the truth. The fact, though, that he was very polite, made many friends prefer to buy medicines from his dispensary. Although he did not know the names and addresses of the brothers who bought medicines from him, he knew them as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once a pioneer brother needed a very expensive and rare medicine for his wife. As the brother did not have enough to pay for it, he decided not to take it. The pharmacist kindly insisted that the brother take the medicine and made note of the medicine’s name and price. As soon as the pioneer left the drugstore, he remembered that the druggist did not ask for either his name or his address. He returned and asked the druggist why he trusted him so much. To that the pharmacist smiled, opened his memorandum book and put his finger on the expression “Jehovah’s witnesses” under which the name and price of the medicine were recorded. Then he added: “I am sure you are honest people, and you will never dishonor the name of Jehovah your God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although materialism has a strong grip on many persons, it is completely powerless with persons who get to know and love Jehovah with all their heart. This was true of a crippled lady. For more than eight years she was unable to leave her bed or even to sit, but she embraced the truth only some months ago. Her husband is old and unable to work. They have a son and a girl, fourteen and twelve years old. As soon as the lady understood that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth, she no longer let her children attend Sunday school. Her husband’s family, who support her financially, threatened to cut off the allowance they were giving, if she persisted in following Jehovah’s witnesses. They also promised her children a big piece of cultivable land if they would resume their Sunday-school course. In spite of all these difficulties, both she and her children continue to associate with the Witnesses and announce God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After reading the foregoing, one can only say that Jehovah’s witnesses were filled with the holy spirit and they ‘were speaking the word of God with boldness.’ (Acts 4:31) Just as it was in the days of the early Christians, so it has been during the 1964 service year with Jehovah's Christian witnesses. They have gone out to disciple people of all nations. The report has shown you that the good news of God’s kingdom has been preached in 194 different lands. Some may ask whether more was done this year in the interests of God’s kingdom than during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you look at the hours spent in the field, 162,808,312 hours, we can say that this was the greatest witness ever given in one year by Jehovah’s witnesses. It is 11,557,070 hours more than were spent in the field during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results were very gratifying too. During the year there were 3,959,352 more back-calls made than during the previous year, and 38,897 more Bible studies conducted in the homes of the people each week. As you will note on the chart, 741,367 home Bible studies were conducted regularly, weekly, throughout the year, and this brought results, because by the end of the service year there were 68,236 persons who were baptized, indicating that they had dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will and that they were going to do the same thing that Jehovah’s witnesses were doing, namely, preach the good news. This was an increase of 5,438 baptized over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Activity has not slowed down, for more of Jehovah’s witnesses have arranged their affairs so that they could be in the special pioneer service. There was an increase in that field over last year of 452. There are now 7,927 special pioneers and missionaries working in all parts of the world. The pioneer work increased too, and, as you have seen, there were 35,011 pioneers in the field, an increase over last year of 3,913. Much of this increase was due to the thousands of congregation publishers who took up vacation pioneering for one or two months throughout the year. In addition to that there have been many who have taken up the regular pioneer work, spending 100 hours each month throughout the year in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. Among the congregation publishers there was an increase of 40,857. In fact, the overall picture for the congregation publishers, the special pioneers and the regular pioneers shows that there was a total increase of 45,222 individuals going out in the field service each month. As the chart shows, there were 1,001,870 Christian witnesses of Jehovah talking to people in many languages right around the world every month during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the very interesting increases are these: New subscriptions obtained, 117,894 more than the previous year; 10,209,237 more individual copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> were placed, 74,786 more public meetings were held, 115,724 more persons attended the Memorial. All of this shows that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is progressing grandly, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. The year’s report shows that there was an increase in every feature of the ministry except the distribution of booklets. We placed 13,181,871, which was 1,623,612 fewer than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This fine report has brought real satisfaction to Jehovah’s witnesses around the world, and the brothers in the organization are certainly supporting the work financially. They made it possible for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to spend millions of dollars to send missionaries and special pioneers out to the ends of the earth, as well as to serve all the 23,483 congregations with circuit and district servants throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To keep the 7,927 missionaries and special pioneers going in the field cost the Society $3,005,709.20. The congregations served by circuit and district servants will be pleased to know that around the world 2,036 of such brothers visited the congregations, and it cost the Society $540,848.02. Therefore, to assist the missionaries, special pioneers, circuit and district servants, all of whom are full-time workers, the Society spent a total of $3,546,557.22. Additionally, the Society operated the Bethel homes where 1,461 full-time workers were employed. In such homes they are fed, sheltered and clothed. These expenses were taken care of by contributions on the part of our brothers around the world and for this we are truly grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is marvelous to see the prosperity that Jehovah has brought to his people. It is Jehovah who has decreed that this witness should be given and the work accomplished. Today we see Jehovah’s witnesses following the admonition of the angel flying in midheaven, because “he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> loud voice: ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.’” (Rev. 14:6, 7) That has indeed been a privilege during this past year, and now, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we move ahead into a new service year, 1965, still filled with the holy spirit and speaking the word of God with boldness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time we must have in mind that we do not want to become fearful of those who kill the body. As we get closer to the end of this wicked system of things and observe the affairs of the world it makes all of us want to hasten our work of letting mankind know of the marvelous message Jehovah has set forth in the Bible. So Jehovah’s witnesses will not slack their hands, but will be more determined than ever to show their faithfulness to Jehovah, and their love for him, by good works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If it be Jehovah’s will, the 1965 service year will prove to be a year for an even greater witness concerning God’s kingdom. God’s visible organization is united and is determined to move ahead. The expression in every branch report shows this unity and determination. Every branch office asked me to convey the love and greetings of the brothers of each country to all their brothers to the ends of the earth, and to let them know that they are standing with their brothers shoulder to shoulder declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. They all had in mind the text for 1964: “Filled with the holy spirit and . . . speaking the word of God with boldness.” As they did that the persecution in many places was heavy. But Jehovah’s witnesses are prepared to move into an even more difficult year, if that is necessary, in order to declare the “everlasting good news.” The Society wisely has presented us another year’s text that may be very helpful in aiding us to stand our ground, in that it says: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.” By Jehovah’s help and undeserved kindness we will continue on fearlessly doing the will of God, knowing that he is backing us up to the very limit. If in certain places, or everywhere throughout the world, the enemy’s anger becomes fierce against God’s servants and he kills, as he has before, we certainly will not become fearful, for this is God’s work and we are his servants. Let all of us, then, be of good courage and press on, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. Be assured of my warm love and best wishes for all of you too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On a beautiful, warm, sunny, October 1, 1964, the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania met together in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for their annual meeting. The main auditorium was packed out and overflowed to the basement auditorium. The total attendance reported was 1,507.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, opened the session at 9:30 a.m., calling George M. Couch to read the text and comments as they appear in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> for that day. Following this, for the remaining part of the half-hour, until shortly after ten o’clock, Douglas Held of Strathfield, Australia, A. Pryce Hughes of London, England, August H. Peters of Wiesbaden, Western Germany, Johan H. Eneroth of Jakobsberg, Sweden, and Panayotis E. Gabrielidis of Limassol, Cyprus, all gave short talks on what is going on in their respective countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At 10:07 in the morning the formal business meeting was opened by the president. He called on Anton Koer-ber to offer prayer. The secretary of the Society presented facts showing that there were 438 members of the Pennsylvania corporation present, either in person or by proxy, of the 443 that were members of the Pennsylvania corporation on October 1, 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the orders of business for the meeting was the election of two directors whose terms of office had expired, namely, those of T. J. Sullivan and Grant Suiter. They were unanimously reelected to a term of three years. After discussing a few other matters, the president, N. H. Knorr, called on other representatives from foreign lands to give reports on the work in their respective countries. These brothers spoke in the following order: Maurice J. Fleury of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, William L. Barry of Tokyo, Japan, Raymond V. Franz of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Filip C. S. Hoffmann of Copenhagen, Denmark, Plato D. Idreos of Athens, Greece, Ronald N. Jacka of Djakarta, Indonesia, Benjamin B. Mason of Auckland, New Zealand, and Robert N. Tracy of Barranquilla, Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All these thirteen members of the Pennsylvania corporation from foreign countries gave fine experiences, and their talks were greatly appreciated by all in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Knorr then spoke for one hour on the subject “Do Not Become Fearful of Those Who Kill the Body.” The talk was based on Matthew, chapter ten, verse twenty-eight, and it proved to be very timely admonition in these days of great distress and persecution that have come upon Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The annual meeting was adjourned with prayer by N. H. Knorr at 12:35 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On October 6, 1964, in the office of the president at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, there was a meeting of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. Prayer was offered by T. J. Sullivan, and N. H. Knorr presided at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to elect officers for the ensuing year, and the following were unanimously elected: N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer, and H. H. Riemer, assistant secretary and treasurer. The names of the other members of the board of directors present are M. G. Henschel, T. J. Sullivan and L. A. Swingle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The annual report of receipts and disbursements was read to the board of directors and the statement of the condition of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was presented and unanimously accepted. Some comments were made on the fine work that was being carried on throughout the world on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses. The brothers who have been appointed to these positions of overseers, directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, wished it stated that they appreciate very much the responsibilities placed upon them and are delighted to serve their fellow workers around the world. All are members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn, New York, and rejoice in their daily privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This meeting was closed by prayer to Jehovah God offered by N. H. Knorr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEW YORK SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., was held on January 4, 1964, at its Brooklyn (New York) headquarters. For the information of Jehovah’s witnesses the directors and officers of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., are as follows: N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer, H. H. Riemer and J. O. Groh, as assistants secretary and treasurer; G. M. Couch, director, and M. H. Larson, director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been a pleasure for these brothers to serve the interests of God’s visible organization in their service positions during the past year and they have been grateful to have a share in spreading the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Do not become fearful of those who kill the body” —Matt. 10:88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why should Jesus tell his disciples that they should not become fearful of those who kill the body? Listen! “Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.” Christ had pity for the people because he saw that they were like sheep without a shepherd. A great work had to be done even there among the children of Israel. They had strayed far from the true worship of Jehovah their God. The harvest was great, but the workers were very few. “So he summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.” Naming his twelve disciples, he sent them all forth with these orders: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Samaritan city; but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ This was just like the work that Jesus had been doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their preaching activity would not be an easy work. His disciples were going to be rejected the same way that Jesus himself was finally rejected by the nation of Israel and nailed to the torture stake. Despite persecution, they were ordered to go into the cities and villages and to search out all those who were deserving of hearing the truth. Upon entering any house the disciples were to greet the householder with peace. They were not calling to scold people, or to quarrel with them, even if the people did not accept the peace and the wonderful message they had. If the people showed that they were “not deserving,” Jesus said, “let the peace from you return upon you,” and shake the dust off your feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus now makes a strong statement to his disciples: “Truly I say to you, It will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city.” This implied that the judgment day for Sodom and Gomorrah was not past. Did Jesus mean that these Sodomites would yet appear before God for a final judgment, and be resurrected by Jehovah along with these Jews who refused to hear the peaceful message the disciples had? What would happen when the people of Sodom and Gomorrah heard such a message as the people in Israel were hearing while the disciples</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">were going from house to house and village to village? Well, it would be more endurable for those of Sodom and Gomorrah when resurrected than for these resurrected Jews who had heard Jesus’ message,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus most certainly must have made his disciples think. Jesus warned that their work was not going to be easy. They were being sent forth as sheep amidst wolves. They had to be very careful in all their activity. They were not to be timid or afraid, but were to ‘prove themselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.’ They were going to be brought before courts and scourged in synagogues. They would be hailed before governors and kings. The reason that this would be done was for a witness to the authorities and to the nations over which they ruled. No matter what happened they were not to be disturbed about standing before the great men of the world. Why? The disciples had walked with Jesus. They had heard him preach. They had listened. They were taught. The truth was in their hearts and minds. They had observed how he handled himself in similar situations. So he admonished them not to be anxious about how or what they were going to speak under such circumstances. Have faith in Jehovah, your Father in heaven. “What you are to speak will be given you in that hour.” So Jesus told them: “It is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you.” What faith! They had to be very strong so as to believe that Jehovah would back them up with holy spirit and help them to say the things that were to be said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now Jesus spoke about a more serious matter. Death! Dying could be involved because of speaking the truth. Jesus warned: “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death.” Can you imagine such an extreme thing happening in a household where the disciples preached? Would the truth divide households to the point of members killing one another or delivering people up to be killed? All this could happen because a person preached God’s Word and became a true follower of Christ Jesus. Even the disciples themselves would be “objects of hatred by all people on account of my name.” If people are going to deliver up to death those of their own household, then that would certainly put the disciples in danger of being killed by opposers too. Nevertheless, Jesus said: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus knew that one day he was to be killed because of the work he did, and so he told his disciples: “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.” The same things were going to happen to some of his followers. Even knowing this there was no reason to quit. If they were really his disciples, then they would preach the good news even until their death. Think on what Jesus was saying. If people who heard the truth and accepted it were going to be killed by their own fleshly brothers, or children, because they believed Christ’s teachings, what do you think was going to happen to the ones who originally preached to the believers? People will try to kill them too. So Jesus said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” To believe that took a lot of faith. But Jesus believed that and proved it in his own death and resurrection. His disciples believed in the resurrection of the dead too. (For detailed discussion read Matthew 9:35 to 10:28.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you believe these things? If you are a dedicated Christian, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, you will carry on as faithfully in the service of God as God’s own Son Jesus Christ did, and as his disciples did whom he sent forth to preach that the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near! The disciple of Jesus Christ is convinced that he is right and the message that he has is for the world of mankind. Nothing will stop him from declaring the good news of God’s kingdom to everyone he meets. He will preach it with kindness, meekness, and with firm belief as he makes every effort to help those listening. It takes time and patience to convince a person that the only hope for mankind is God’s kingdom. If you believe it as much as the twelve disciples believed it, and as Jesus believed it, you will be a busy preacher, going from house to house, and village to village. With such faith you will never become fearful of those who kill the body, because you know they cannot kill the soul. There is a resurrection of the dead! Be courageous! Press on, declaring the good news, and know that your King, Christ Jesus, who has been set upon the throne by his heavenly Father is saying to you today: “Go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ ”</span></p>

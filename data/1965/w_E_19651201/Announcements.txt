FIELD MINISTRY
One who obeys the commandments of Jesus Christ fears, not men, but God. He knows that, not men, but God is the one who will award everlasting life to his faithful servants. To enable others, in addition to themselves, to gain that blessing, they publicly proclaim the truths of the Bible, and that in spite of any opposition they encounter. During December, as Jehovah’s witnesses talk to people about the Bible, they will also be offering them the modern-English New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, along with the new book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” on a contribution of $1.50.

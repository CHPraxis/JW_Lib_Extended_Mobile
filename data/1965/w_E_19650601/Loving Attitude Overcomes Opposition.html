<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ A young man in the Philippine Islands became the only one in his family to accept the truth about God’s kingdom. When he became one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he soon faced severe opposition from his wife. He stated: “The opposition was so fierce at times that I felt I could not go on, but I was strengthened by scriptures such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:21-45:12:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:21</a>: ‘Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.’</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“After my dedication and baptism my wife’s hatred of the Bible truths as taught by the Witnesses became more intense. When she saw me regularly attending congregational meetings and sharing in ministerial activity, she told me that if I did not stop attending the meetings she would go to the Kingdom Hall and cause a scene in front of all the other Witnesses to embarrass me. Still I did not retaliate or get angry but showed a loving attitude and continued my service to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“During the next few months my wife did her best to hinder my ministerial work. She refused to wash and iron my clothes or to prepare my food when I was going out in the field ministry. Instead of repaying her in the same way, I remembered the scripture in Romans and showed her even more loving consideration than ever before. I helped her in home duties and did not complain when I had to prepare my own food and clothes. As a result of this loving attitude, she began to realize that I was practicing right Christian conduct and she changed her entire attitude. Now she cooperates in helping me prepare for meetings and is happy that I am serving Jehovah. You can imagine my joy at this time to see her studying the Bible along with me.”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
True followers of Jesus Christ maintain unity of faith and work by cooperating closely with one another and with Jehovah’s visible organization, which is directing the worldwide preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. During August this unity will be manifest as they call at the homes of people everywhere to share the faith-inspiring truths contained in God’s Word. As an aid to interested persons, they will offer Bible-study publications, on a small contribution.
HOW PRACTICAL IS THE BIBLE?
What is practical and beneficial today is often overlooked in favor of what is expedient. For this reason some persons may be inclined to view the Bible as impractical. Are you? Do you know someone who is? Prove to your satisfaction that the Bible is the most practical guide to modern living available. How? By obtaining and reading the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” Here you will learn of the Bible’s thirty-nine writers, their backgrounds and qualifications and the value of their writings to their own generations and to us. Send today. This 352-page hardbound book is only $1.

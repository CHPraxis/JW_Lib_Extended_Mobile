FIELD MINISTRY
In the first century of our Common Era the apostles of Jesus Christ urged the people: “Get saved from this crooked generation” (Acts 2:40) If the need to do so was great then, how much more so is it urgent today! For that reason, Jehovah’s witnesses regularly call at the homes of people everywhere, talking to others about the purposes of Jehovah God and leaving with interested persons literature that will build up their appreciation for the Bible. As they engage in this work during October they will be offering a year’s subscription for the magazine Awake!, along with three. Bible-study booklets, for $1.

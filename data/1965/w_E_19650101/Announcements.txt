FIELD MINISTRY
Spiritually fortified as a result of Bible study, Jehovah’s witnesses will be active during January in helping others to acquire spiritual strength. This they will do by discussing with them Bible truths and by offering them a year’s subscription for this magazine, The Watchtower, along with three Scriptural booklets, on a contribution of $1.
BEGIN EACH DAY REFRESHED
A daily period of thinking on God’s Word not only refreshes, but it builds strong faith for the future. You can make the most of ten or fifteen minutes each day by considering the Daily Text and Comments published in the 1965 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. At the same time you will be making a valuable review of The Watchtower, because comments on the texts consist of quotations from issues of The Watchtower for 1964. Also, you will enjoy the report of worldwide preaching done by, Jehovah’s witnesses this past year. Send for the 1965 Yearbook. It is only 50c. Send also for the encouraging calendar for 1965. It is 25c.

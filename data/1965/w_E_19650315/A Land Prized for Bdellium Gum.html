<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Gold and onyx you may know, but do you know what bdellium gum is? The land of Havilah had all three. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:11-1:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 2:11, 12</a>) It was obviously precious, being mentioned with the onyx stone and gold. It must have been known to the Israelites, because Moses compared the appearance of manna to bdellium gum. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:7-4:11:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 11:7</a>) This aromatic gum was very much prized in antiquity, being held in high esteem by both Jews and Gentiles. The gum came from a tree, and, according to Pliny, was transparent, waxy, and oily to the touch. It was fragrant to a considerable distance around, having an aroma and taste like that of myrrh but weaker. When burned, bdellium gum diffuses a balsamic odor. The ancients used it like myrrh—in perfumes, incense and medicine.</p>

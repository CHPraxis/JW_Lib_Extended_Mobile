<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God progressively reveals his purposes to his servants. Though the Bible has contained the written word of God for centuries, it is in our time that large numbers of its prophecies are being fulfilled and are, for the first time, being clearly understood. The <em>Watchtower </em>magazine is published to aid interested persons to benefit from these truths. During March, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to offer to all persons a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible-study aid, with three booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>A DEFENSE AGAINST BIBLE SKEPTICISM</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In a world of mounting skepticism toward the Bible, you need a real defense, one that accurately portrays the Bible for what it is, God’s inspired Word written for the benefit of lovers of righteousness in all ages but particularly for us on whom the end of the present systems of things has come. The book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” </em>provides all this and more. It is a hard-bound book of 352 pages, the same page size as <em>The Watchtower, </em>containing 78 chapter divisions. Send for your copy today. It is only $1.</p>

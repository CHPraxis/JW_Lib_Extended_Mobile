<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To help many to become God’s “men of good will,” Jehovah’s witnesses will be diligent in calling on people everywhere during February to stimulate their appreciation for Bible truth. In addition to talking to them personally and pointing out in the Bible the grand hope that Jehovah God has set before mankind, they will offer a year’s subscription for this magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>along, with three Scriptural booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

If you do, then you will want the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>for 1964. This comprehensive index lists subjects and Scripture texts covered in both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 1964. It will help you to locate the elusive points you: remember reading but cannot fully recall; it will direct you to other references or discussions of the same point; it will assist you with difficult texts you encounter in your regular Bible reading. Same page size as <em>The Watchtower. </em>Send for your copy today. It is only 10c.</p>

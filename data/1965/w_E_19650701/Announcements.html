<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Faithfulness and loyalty are qualities that all servants of Jehovah God need. As they carry on their ministry, preaching God’s Word, they find that they are called on to demonstrate these qualities every day. This will continue to be true during July as Jehovah’s witnesses call on people everywhere to point out from the Bible the dangers of false religion and the blessings of God’s kingdom. To aid truth seekers, they will offer the book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!, </em>along with a booklet, on a contribution of 75c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>SINCERITY CANNOT COVER CONTRADICTIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“What’s in a name?” Many say that of religion—“just as long as you are sincere.” But sincerity cannot cover the multitude of opposing and contradictory beliefs. Nor can such differences be pleasing to God. The apostle Paul made this clear when he said there are “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” Your life depends on learning where these differences arose and how a vast system of false worship has grown out of the conflicting views about God. We are commanded to ‘get out of her lest we suffer of her plagues.’ Read <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>Send now and receive free the booklet <em>God’s Way Is Love. </em>Send only 75c.</p>

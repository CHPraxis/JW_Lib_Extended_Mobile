“I Will by No Means Leave You”
● The Watch Tower Society has maintained in Brazil, as in other countries of the world, a special school called the Kingdom Ministry School for training congregation overseers. Although free, it has often involved great difficulties for the overseers, as they still needed to support their families while they were away for a month taking the course.
One of such overseers, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, who has a wife and four children, thought that his situation in this respect was so difficult that he would not be able to take the course. Two weeks before his group was to begin, he still had no solution. So he prayed to Jehovah God, and the exact answer can be summed up in the words of Hebrews 13:5, where Jehovah promises: “I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you.” Several brothers, knowing the overseer’s financial difficulties, took good care of his family in a material way, while he, although poor in this world’s wealth, became richer in knowledge of God and received training so that he could give more and more help to the brothers in his congregation.

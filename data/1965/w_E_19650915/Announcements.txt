FIELD MINISTRY
A person who believes God’s Word has every reason to speak boldly when he shares its message with others. This does not mean that he lacks kindness and consideration for others, but he is not apologetic about the teachings of the Bible. He knows that they are the truth, and he confidently shares them with others. This Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do during September as they call on people everywhere to share with them the good news that the Bible contains, doing so both by their spoken word and by offering Bible literature to interested persons on a small contribution.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today many persons sincerely believe that religion has no part in their lives. Do you? You will be surprised to learn then that, whether you consider yourself religious or not, your own life is affected by false worship that has grown up over the centuries and has fastened itself on every phase of man’s activity the world over. How has it come about? What is your protection? Obtain and read the 704-page hardbound book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! </em>Send only 75c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A person who believes God’s Word has every reason to speak boldly when he shares its message with others. This does not mean that he lacks kindness and consideration for others, but he is not apologetic about the teachings of the Bible. He knows that they are the truth, and he confidently shares them with others. This Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to do during September as they call on people everywhere to share with them the good news that the Bible contains, doing so both by their spoken word and by offering Bible literature to interested persons on a small contribution.</p>

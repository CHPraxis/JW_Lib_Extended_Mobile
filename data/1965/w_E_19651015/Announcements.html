<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the first century of our Common Era the apostles of Jesus Christ urged the people: “Get saved from this crooked generation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:40-44:2:40" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 2:40</a>) If the need to do so was great then, how much more so is it urgent today! For that reason, Jehovah’s witnesses regularly call at the homes of people everywhere, talking to others about the purposes of Jehovah God and leaving with interested persons literature that will build up their appreciation for the Bible. As they engage in this work during October they will be offering a year’s subscription for the magazine <em>Awake!, </em>along with three Bible-study booklets, for $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>PEACE SOON? YES! LEARN HOW!</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thousands of lives have been sacrificed in man’s effort to rule the world. Yet, to many persons, a unified rule of all people seems to be farther away than ever. Without it, lasting peace is impossible. Does that make the prospects seem hopeless? It would if it were not for the special sacrifice of one particular life that has opened the way. Men of all nations <em>will </em>be united and our generation will see it accomplished! The main article in this magazine has shown you how and what your part in such a future can be. Now this thrilling news, delivered as a talk to hundreds of thousands this summer at the “Word of Truth” assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses, is available in the 32-page booklet <em>World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace. </em>Share this good news with others. Each booklet, 5c; seven for 25c.</p>

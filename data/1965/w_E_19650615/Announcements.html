<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No book should be better known than the Bible. What do you know about it? Do you know who the writers are? when and why they wrote? what the general contents of each book are? what its particular value is to us today? The book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” </em>will acquaint you with the Bible in more ways than you would have believed possible. Read it with the excellent modern-English version <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>Both for only $2. Send now and receive free two timely 32-page booklets on Bible subjects.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since Jehovah God loved the world of mankind so much that he gave his only-begotten Son to die on their behalf, those who appreciate that love are likewise under obligation to manifest love. This love moves them to serve God, to expend themselves on behalf of fellow believers, and to carry to others the good news about God’s loving provisions for all mankind. For that reason, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to call at the homes of people everywhere to discuss the Bible with them, and during June they will be offering the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>and the book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” </em>with two booklets, for $2.</p>

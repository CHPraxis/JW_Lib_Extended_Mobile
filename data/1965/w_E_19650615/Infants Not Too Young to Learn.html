<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:15</a> the Bible says, “From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.” To help infants, very young children, to learn the “holy writings,” many Christian parents have used the book <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. </em>In this regard one mother in Pennsylvania writes: “Though just two years old, my little daughter dearly loves her copy and almost daily ‘studies.’ She can ‘explain’ all the pictures up to page 85—in her fashion. She doesn’t talk too much yet, but by gestures and demonstrations and answering my questions with the words she does know, she proves she knows what each is about. For instance, ‘What did Jehovah tell Adam and Eve about the fruit?’ ‘No, no’—then demonstrates how they and their children had to cry because they were bad. She knows where each of the animals is in the picture of Noah and the ark and shakes her head violently as to whether the bad people got in the ark. She even has a game about the Israelites walking around Jericho. She builds some blocks up. Then she walks around and around them, finally pretending she is blowing a horn and exclaiming ‘Down, down!’ as she knocks the blocks over. It is so much fun to teach her, and we appreciate so much the illustrations that help her to learn the Holy Scriptures.”</p>

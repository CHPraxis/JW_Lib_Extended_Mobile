<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A letter to the magazine <em>Church and Home, </em>published by the Evangelical United Brethren Church, was printed in its issue of July 1, 1964. The letter said: “Many of our leaders and some of our people seem to feel that the answer to our decline in numbers is a simple merger with the Methodist Church. Combining two dead churches will help neither of us but only require a larger grave for burial. We don’t need more programs, committees, suppers, . . . All of us need to study God’s Word more. . . . Many of our services are beautiful but so are funerals.”</p>

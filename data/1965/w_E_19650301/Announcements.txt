FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah God progressively reveals his purposes to his servants. Though the Bible has contained the written word of God for centuries, it is in our time that large numbers of its prophecies are being fulfilled and are, for the first time, being clearly understood. The Watchtower magazine is published to aid interested persons to benefit from these truths. During March, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to offer to all persons a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible-study aid, with three booklets, on a contribution of $1.
CONVENTION INFORMATION
No doubt you are planning to attend one of the conventions for Bible instruction being arranged for this summer by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. But which one will it be? Some of you may be planning to attend assemblies in Europe, which were listed in the January 15 Watchtower. Others will be attending in the United States and Canada, and details concerning those assemblies are given here for your benefit. Additional information, concerning rooming accommodations and other matters, will be provided later.

Learn what God’s will is for this generation and comply with it. Both The Watchtower and Awake! are dedicated to assist you. Read them for one year and find out. Send only $2.

LORD’S EVENING MEAL
The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal in 1965 is Friday, April 16, after 6 p.m., Standard Time. Each congregation should start now to make arrangements so that all of Jehovah’s witnesses and other interested persons can gather together for this occasion. A qualified speaker, one of the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers, if available and capable, should be assigned to deliver the discourse.

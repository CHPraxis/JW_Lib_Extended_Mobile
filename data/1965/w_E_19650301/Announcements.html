<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God progressively reveals his purposes to his servants. Though the Bible has contained the written word of God for centuries, it is in our time that large numbers of its prophecies are being fulfilled and are, for the first time, being clearly understood. The <em>Watchtower </em>magazine is published to aid interested persons to benefit from these truths. During March, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to offer to all persons a year’s subscription for this outstanding Bible-study aid, with three booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>CONVENTION INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No doubt you are planning to attend one of the conventions for Bible instruction being arranged for this summer by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. But which one will it be? Some of you may be planning to attend assemblies in Europe, which were listed in the January 15 <em>Watchtower. </em>Others will be attending in the United States and Canada, and details concerning those assemblies are given here for your benefit. Additional information, concerning rooming accommodations and other matters, will be provided later.</p>

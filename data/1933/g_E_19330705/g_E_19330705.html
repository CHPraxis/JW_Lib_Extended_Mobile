In thousands of places gullies have been worn to the bed rock; in thousands of other places the farmers are now subsoil farmers, getting meager crops. Many ponds have been silted up and the fish destroyed; many fertile fields have been covered with gravel and sand. In Kansas the windstorms have in many places blown the topsoil away. It is estimated that erosion takes twenty-one times as much away from the soil every year as is taken by cropping. Uncle Sam is now studying the erosion problem at ten field stations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend Doctor Reinhold Niebuhr, of Union Theological Seminary, New York, lecturing at Yale Divinity School, made a close approach to the truth when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The civilization and culture in which mankind is living will perish through the very miracle of productivity which it helped to create. The unequal distribution of wealth is slowly undermining the stability of our civilization. It creates unemployment for millions ; and the competition of unemployed with those who are employed further debases the living standards of the latter. This tendency of a machine civilization to make profit-seeking an end in itself will not only destroy it, but it produces individuals who are incapable of saving it from disaster.”</span></p>

After the sale, as in America, the goods are returned by the buyers to the distrained farmers. The farmers that hitherto have been the mainstay of the church are getting to hate it.</span></p>

He tried this out on a member of his flock, 68 years of age, the president of the church board, at the Sunday morning “service”, February 19, and being a broad-shouldered, heavy-set man, he made a great hit. He blacked both eyes of the aged man, besides giving him contusions over the right eye and lacerations of the forehead. He did this in church just before he was to preach on “What the Church Ought to Be”. It is believed that Reverend Robinson could have put even more marks on a man three times his age, 102, than he did on this man that is twice his age, 68. The Lutheran Wallop is a powerful wallop.

We have tried the ‘war’ way; perhaps we shall have to try turning the other cheek. We have tried the way of self-assertive aggressiveness; perhaps we shall come in the end to the way of meekness. We have tried the way of every man scrambling for himself and letting the Devil take the poor beggar who loses out in the scramble; perhaps we may be driven to accept the principle that if one member suffers the whole body is in terrific danger of pain and death. All this looks as if there are ultimate laws that keep driving us toward the way of Jesus as the only way of saving ourselves.'<sup>1</sup></span></p>

This American situation, though millions of Americans still refuse to admit it, is inextricably bound up with the world’s situation.”</span></p>

Then David got mad and had Israel arrested, but the case was thrown out of court. Seems as if Brooklynites who are engaged in the praying business ought not to get mad as these two men did, and, anyway, they ought not to throw rocks at one another. Nobody can pray right, at least those that hire him cannot get their money’s v’orth, if while he is praying somebody socks him on the block with a rock.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark240"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>The Habiliments of Men</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE essential habiliments of men are shirts and coats; these two garments he cannot well get along without; they do for women as well as for men; they go back to the beginning of the race. Adam and Eve made their first (partial) shirts out of fig leaves; their first coats were made by Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was not long before somebody discovered that he could get along better among the thistles and thorns, and make better headway over the sharp stones, if he had skins fitted over his feet: shoes. Abram refused to take from the king of Sodom so much as a shoelatchet; they both had shoes and shoestrings, and they also had shirts and coats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a requirement of the law that Aaron’s sons should wear linen hats and linen breeches. This is the only place in the Bible where these articles of dress are mentioned. The “hosen” and “hats” in which Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were bound were neither hose nor hats; they were gowns and mantles. A gown is a shirt, and a mantle is a coat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our ancestors went barelegged; the first knitting machine was invented in 1589. When they got so they knew how to knit, they knit two kinds of stockings, the upper stocks and the nether stocks. The upper stocks became breeches, and the nether stocks became hosiery. Trousers and pantaloons grew from long stockings, and date from about A.D. 1660.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to underwear, that is very recent indeed. An undershirt is simply an under shirt; and drawers are trousers. A waistcoat (vest) is an armless and tailless coat. An overcoat is merely a coat large enough to go over another coat. A woman’s dress is merely a pretty shirt. A skirt is merely the lower part of a shirt.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark242"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>The Two Essential Garments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The two essential garments of Bible times and of every time are the shirt and the coat. Translations have confused the two. Joseph’s “coat of many colors” was a “kethoneth”, probably a sleeveless shirt, reaching to the knee. Aaron’s “embroidered coat” was a tunic similarly made. This was the “garment of divers colours” that poor little Tamar wore, “for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled.”—2 Samuel 13:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of this garment that the Lord Jesus spoke when He said, “If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, . . (Matthew 5: 40) It is of it also that He commanded that the disciples sent out to preach His gospel should “not put on two coats” (Mark 6:9), on the ground that “the workman is worthy of his meat” (Matthew 10:10), and God would see to it that they had what they needed to do His work. This is “the coat . . . without seam, woven from the top throughout” (John 19:23) which constituted the garment next to the Lord’s own body, and for which the soldiers that crucified Him cast lots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was this inner garment that the high priest rent in his fury when Jesus, in answer to his question, said to him, “I am [the Christ, the Son of the Blessed]: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” (Mark 14:61-63) It is easy to visualize the devilish expression on the face of this son of the Devil as he wrenched a hole in his own shirt because of his anger. He could hardly wait to see the Lord murdered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of this garment that the apostle Jude speaks cryptically when he says: “And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted bv the flesh.”— Jude 23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This long sleeveless shirt or tunic, gathered in at the waist by a girdle, is still a standard garment for both men and women in many parts of the world; and it is a sensible garment, allowing excellent ventilation and freedom of movement. In Egypt, for centuries, it was the only article of clothing of the poor. It persists in the modern house dress, in America.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark244"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>The Coat or Outer Garment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It will have been observed that in several instances above the translators have rendered the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">kethoneth</span><span class="font6"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">chiton</span><span class="font6"> by the English word “coat”; “tunic” would have been a better word. The word “coat” is more properly applied to the garment that covers the shirt or tunic in cold weather, and, by the poor, is used as a bed cover at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The little coat that Samuel’s mother made for him every year was an upper tunic or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">meil. </span><span class="font6">Though the size changed, the style did not; for when Samuel was an old man it was this outer garment or mantle that Saul seized and tore as Samuel struggled to elude his grasp, and when Saul consulted the witch of Endor the demon who impersonated Samuel knew to garb him in the same appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest’s “robe of the ephod all of blue” (Exodus 28:31) was one of these outer garments. It had a hole in it so that it could be slipped over the head and the right arm, and it had a hem whereon were fastened alternately bells and pomegranates. (Exodus 39:23-26) The ringing of door bells and the bearing of the fruit of the kingdom are closely related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was one of these outside garments, robes, mantles or coats, that Jonathan stripped off to give to David. It was the skirt of one of these that David cut off from the costume of Saul in the cave, and David himself was clothed in one when the ark of God was brought into the holy city.—1 Chronicles 15: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was of this outer garment that Jesus spoke when He warned of those that “come to you in sheep's clothing”. It was this that was “the wedding garment”. It is of this that Jesus inquired, “Why take ye thought for raiment?” (Matthew G: 28) The scene in Devolution 1; 13 pictures Jesus as clothed with such a garment reaching to His feet, and with its folds gathered into place with a golden girdle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remaining citations to apparel in the Scriptures arc general and refer to either one or both of these garments, but there are special terms to refer to Esther's royal apparel, which was apparently of “silk and purple”, of which material also were made the vestments put on by the worshipers of Baal at the time Jehu cleaned up the land of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some mention is made of women's veils, as worn by Rebekah, and in the familiar chapter, Isaiah 3:19-23, there is mention of women's bonnets, hoods, kerchiefs, mufflers, sashes and shawls. The men, in time of war, had coats of mail, sometimes called “harness”. A special word is used to designate a king's royal robes. The “rough garment”, Elijah's mantle, is also separately indicated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark246"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>Men’s Styles Through the Ages</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Men never, previously, dressed as inartisti-cally as they do today. The tunic, gathered in at the waist by a girdle, gave a pleasing blouse effect to the upper part of his dress and the hips were gracefully covered by the short skirt or kilt which reached to a little above the knee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman toga made every man look like a king, and in the halcyon days of the empire the well-to-do Romans despised pants as garments suitable only for slaves. The toga was sometimes as much as IS feet long. Folding and draping it was a job fox’ an artist. The men got </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">big kick out of it, the while the women stood off and admired them. Alas! Who could admire </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">man climbing into a pair of pants ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The men have had their day, and bungled the job to a fare-ye-well finish. In the Middle Ages we wore armor, and every man looked like </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">nickel-plated magazine-feed parlor coal stove in the days of our dads. And now look at us. Along then we wore tights instead of pants; our tunics were trimmed with fur at top and bottom, and the bottoms were scalloped at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The capes that we then wore were a knockout, all fixed up with tassels and things; our swaggering soft leather boots lent an air of enchantment; when we got to wearing coats we had lace at the ends of the sleeves, but if a man were to do that today everyone around the place would guy him until he would jump out the window, and the street cleaner would gather him up and take him to the place where they sort over the old rags and bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a time when we tame-looking roosters had a row of 21 buttons down the front of our coats; and now if we ask for more than two the tailor gets mad and charges extra. No garters now for us, tied with pretty pink ribbons at the knee, where the ladies could see them, as they used to be. Imagine one of us birds coming down the street in a crimson velvet cape lined with blue satin. We used to do it and get away with it, but that was before the women got started, and now we are all through.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>What We Used to Wear</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">William Hogarth, famous English sculptor and designer, had a coat of sky blue; Goldsmith, the poet, rejoiced in plum color; Reynolds, the painter, went in for deep crimson. Imagine the suffering around here if any man tried to waltz down the street with a sky-blue coat, a crimson vest and plum-colored pants. The police would surely get him and make up the charges afterwards; they would not take any chances of his starting a riot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notches in the collars of our coats came at the time of the French Revolution, and no man since has ever had the courage to ask why they are put in or why they are not left out. These tailors have betrayed us. Where now is the man that dares wear a flapping beaver hat, with a plume of feathers in it fastened with a jewel ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Benjamin Franklin (supposed to have started us on our melancholy course of abjuring all the nice colors, etc.) dressed in plain black. Oh, yes, but it was plain black velvet, and that is not so plain after all. And along with it he had snowy ruffles at his wrists and bosom, white silk stockings, and silver buckles. We have it all down in black and white about Benjamin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1814 we sent five of our best statesmen to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, and it takes eighteen lines of fine type to tell all about the silk-lined coats, gold-embroidered capes, white cassimere breeches, gold knee buckles, white silk stockings, three-cornered chapeaus, and other folderols in which those gents were dolled up, and not a tailor in the world has been able to hatch up an idea in men's clothes from that time to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Queen Elizabeth's time we men had huge trunkhose stuffed with hair. These were made of silk, velvet, satin or damask. Our doublets then were very costly, quilted and stuffed, slashed, fagged, pinched and laced. The cloaks were of all colors, trimmed with gold, silver, silk lace and glass bangles, equally superb inside and out. Those were the days!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>Guilty Man Not Hanged</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The man that should have been hanged is the man that invented the collar, but he apparently escaped the consequences of that dastardly act. Not only that, but the man that invented the movable top to collar studs actually drew royalties of $25,000 a year for a long time, whereas he should have been sent to the gallows. It is these two fellows that have put us where we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Steinkirk cravat dates back to the morning of August 3, 1692. The battle of Steinkirk was fought on that morning. The French nobles were surprised in their sleep and came rushing out of their tents with their cravats all awry. They were victorious, and the flying cravat became the style then and there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The handkerchief, the necktie and the jabot are all one and the same thing; originally used to hold the top of the shirt together, it was not long after the dandies took to carrying an extra kerchief with them until it came to be called a handkerchief, because usually carried in the hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a time when it was considered vulgar to put a kerchief to the nose. That was back in the days when the gentlemen (of Sir Walter Raleigh's time) cut slits in their coat sleeves to show their pretty underwear. Life is humdrum now; we never get a chance to do anything like that any more. And, boy, wouldn't anybody get razzed who tried it? And how!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man who brought us most of our troubles was Beau Brummell. Some kind-hearted relative died and left him a big fortune. He spent it on clothes, principally on white starched collars and neckties, and so successfully made a fool of himself in learning how to arrange his starched neckwear that he became the fashion arbiter of the world. He invented the longlegged trousers, and died in an insane asylum.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>The Prince of Wales</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Men’s fashions for the world usually follow the whims of the prince of Wales, but in Beau Brummell’s day this stigma was temporarily removed. Beau got it away from him, and, for one generation he might have been called, let us say, The prince of Wails, for he became so peeved that he would not even speak to Beau when he met him. Beau knew how to dress; that was the full extent of what he knew. He was as useful in the world as a barber's pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The styles of British royalty are not always followed. Thus King Edward favored a beard and King George has one, but all attempts to bring man back to his chief attraction disappeared with the invention of the safety razor. One of the biggest kicks a mere man gets out of life is the morning removal of the feathers which adorn the spaces between his ears. In France there was recently a movement whiskerwards; the Froggies are partial to chin ornaments. But it barely survived crossing the English Channel, and never got to America at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The difference between pants and trousers is in the price. Bought off the shelves they are pants; made by an expensive tailor they are always trousers. Women have three classifications, oi’ four: aprons, dresses, gowns and robes. Maybe they have more, but it is a subject that cannot be too closely examined.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark254"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>Where We Got Some of Our Styles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The reason why our coats are split up the back is that our ancestors used to ride horseback. We British and ex-British, having once done a thing a certain way, do it that same way a million times on end because we always did do it that way, and for no other conceivable reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason for the buttons above our coat tails is similar. Our ancestors used them to button their front flaps back out of the way when they bestrode their steeds. We continue to wear them till the end of all things, for the same reason that a pig wears a tail. They serve no purpose except that of ornamentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cutaway coats had their origin when some nameless hero, tiring of the flaps, and of buttoning and unbuttoning them, in a moment of desperation grabbed a cleaver and led the offending garment to the chopping block. He should have had a monument for his courage, but instead of that the statues in our parks are usually of generals who led their soldiers from the rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the reign of George III, Earl Spencer made a bet that no fashion was so ridiculous but that it would be worn if introduced by some person of sufficient prominence, lie wagered that he could cut off the tails of his coat and parade the streets merely with the body and sleeves, and some one would follow suit. The bet was taken; and within a week the Spencer coat was being worn all over London, and continued in favor for a generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mackintosh was invented by Charles Mackintosh of Manchester, who first learned how to apply a solution of india rubber in naphtha to cloth while it was in the process of making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a famous 250-mile march of Scottish soldiers over mountainous roads, many of the hoots wore out and the troops bound their lacerated feet with strips of cloth torn from their shirts. That is how, when and where spats originated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Scotland the heather grows knee-high and is often laden with moisture. That is why the kilt remains a part of traditional Scottish costume. The Scot can go through a field of heather and come out quite dry and comfortable, where if he wore long pants, or even short ones, he would be drenched almost to the hips. At first the kilt was a part of the plaid in which the Highlander wrapped himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The breeches of the Gauls were imposed as a style upon mankind when those warriors overran Home. It seems that a man can fight better in short breeches than he can in a toga. But how about the Amazons? The physical defects of certain monarchs have at different times imposed certain styles upon their long-suffering subjects.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark256"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>Conservative, Long-suffering, Timid Man</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Chinese men garbed themselves the same way for a plump two thousand years. We men used to wear muffs, the same as the women. &quot;When they gave them up, we gave them up, but not until we had to. Gloves took their place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hated to give up our capes, and the West Pointers and the Annapolis cadets still cling to them. Traces of them persist in some raincoats. In certain weather certain traffic officers wear them, a sensible garment, all that is left of our toga togs. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Requiescat in. pace.</span><span class="font6"> We mourn their loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The modern man’s outfit is a congeries of items from the ends of the earth: hat from Danbury ; shirt and collar from Troy; necktie from Paterson; shoes from Brockton; fountain pen from New York; straw hat from Italy, but with a sweatband from a New Zealand sheep; the silk for his tie comes from Japan; his suspender buckles from Birmingham; the cotton for his shirt, if it is an extra good one, from Egypt; his summer coat of mohair is the gift of Turkish goats; Argentina sent the leather hides from which his shoes were made; Mexico furnished the graphite for his pencil; Rhodesia furnished the chrome green that tinted the dollar bill in his wallet; the nickel in his pocket is Canadian nickel; his fountain pen is made of South African gold, but is tipped with platinum from Russia's Ural mountains; his rubber heels are from Java; Brazil furnished his shoe polish; and nobody knows where the cow lived that furnished the casein for his fountain pen holder. And that is not the half of it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark258"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>“The Men Should Wear Dresses”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Y<sup>T</sup>es, they should! That is what Professor Albert Bachem, of the University of Illinois College of Medicine says. But it is a safe bet that you could not get the professor to wear one in his classroom for a cool million dollars, coin of the realm, until some hero yet unborn takes the notion. The man that does this thing should be a widower, not caring whether he lives or dies, and nobody else caring either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The scientists have it all figured out that <sup>£</sup>’the temperature within the clothing of the average man is 87.8° Fahrenheit; for women’s clothing it is only 80.G°. The relative humidity inside men’s clothing is 70%, and for women it is only </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">55%”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Ephraim R. Mulford, president of the New Jersey Medical Society, maintains that America's women are in better physical condition than her men; and the reason is that the woman lives in the atmosphere of the Alps; the men, in a self-imposed torrid zone maintained the year around for the parts of the body that are best kept cool. The man’s dress is carefully arranged so that no air can get to any part of him except his face and hands. The extra load thrown upon his sweat glands overburdens his kidneys and shortens his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make sure that he will get no ventilation, and that his circulation will be choked, the man wears tight garters, and a belt. Collars and sleeve bands finish the job of killing off his circulation. A tight-fitting hat keeps the blood from his scalp and removes his locks permanently.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark260"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>The Fright at Suspenders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Every woman knows that every man wears pants, and that many of them are bigger around the waist than they are around the hips; yet if he wears suspenders to keep his trousers from disclosing his nether garments, she feels in duty bound to swoon or avert her gaze like a church deacon passing a circus poster. For pure buncombe, this is the bunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the poor man feels that he must keep on his coat and vest in weather when eggs will cook on the porch steps, or else squeeze his waist with a belt that crowds his dinner out of place and makes him feel as though an invitation to the gallows would be a pleasing gift. The suspender men should pay us for this. Suspenders, in alarmingly attractive designs, and in all colors of the spectrum, can now be had for less money than it used to cost to steal them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men should wear pajamas in summer, and pants and collarless panty waists in winter. Everybody knows that is the solemn truth. That is the fact, but the hope and courage mentioned on the cover of this journal are missing from all mankind. When a North Carolina editor made a start pajamawise, the New York makers of pajamas let it be known they disapproved, and that ended it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the president of the Men’s Style Designers’ Convention in New York wanted to recommend blouses for men in hot weather, the secretary of the same sat down on him with the sad news: '“This organization does a billiondollar business. All these men are wool merchants. Your plan would cut our throats.” Pity he did not go ahead and cut them! The woolens which these billion-dollar magnates sell to us poor men are only half as transparent to ultraviolet light penetration as the beautiful rayons, batistes and nainsooks in which woman partially clothes her lovely form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men love bright colors, the same as women, maybe more so, but the recovery from the Benjamin Franklin and Beau Brummell superstitions is slow and the average group of men presents about as attractive an appearance as a load of mine props; they all have the same color of hat, and nearly the same color of suit. Once in a while a man of rare courage will have a little color in his necktie, if his wife bought the tie.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark262"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>Men's Dress Reform Party</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Four years ago a Men’s Dress Reform Party was started in Great Britain. In four years of careful thought on the subject they have got so far as to admit that when the Creator made man He made him the right shape, and they see no reason why sometime in the far future they should not dress to fit that shape. Meantime they will continue to look like beetles, the ill-favored kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not know if the party is still in existence. It recommended abandonment of trousers, collars, vests (waistcoats), unnecessary buttons and excessive and ridiculous pockets. It advocated sandals. The day the party was to have its grand parade in the cause of knee panties, it came off a cold drizzle, and most of the would-be marchers kept on their long pants, stood on the sidewalks, and joined in jeering their suffering brothers as they came along. The slogan of the party is or was, “Fewer clothes, lighter clothes, cleaner clothes, brighter clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1929 Long Beach, California, had a men’s dress reform parade, in which a cash prize of $200 went to the man who designed the best outfit of knee pants, sleeves to the elbow, and sockless feet for summer wear. Japan has an anti-necktie society. Its announced purpose is to prevent persons from taking cold. Hence it advocates dressing as thinly as possible, never wearing anything around the neck, and the discarding of overcoats except in rainy weather or on winter nights or when ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Automobile driving has perceptibly lessened some of the finickiness of men with regard to their clothing. In some instances the automobile got the money that would have gone into a new suit. Attempts to persuade or cajole men into one-piece suits have met with flat failure. About the only signs of progress are that the stiff hat and the stiff collar have given way to soft ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For safety’s sake the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad requires employees to wear form-fitting clothing, abjuring ragged sleeves, dangling tatters on shirts, or flapping shoe soles. It is a sensible rule.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>English Cloth and London Tailors</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Though New York claims to be the best-dressed city in the world, yet English cloth is accounted the world’s best cloth, and London tailors the best tailors. The only criticism of their art is that they make their pants too tight under the arms. By putting armholes in the sides, the tops could be made still higher and the vests or waistcoats dispensed with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In New York, if a Jew pantsmaker puts in enough cloth to reach part way up the hips he feels that he has done more than he should. Six more inches on top of a British pair of pants, and a puckering string for the top, to go around the neck, gives us a more or less ideal one-piece suit—for such as want that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world’s record for making a suit speedily was made on May 18, 1898, by Thomas Kitson, owner of the Stroudsburg (Pa.) mills. In six hours and four minutes from the time the shearing of the sheep began, the suit was on Mr. Kitson’s back. The actual tailoring required </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2y&gt;</span><span class="font6"> hours. As long ago as 1811 British tailors made a record of 131J hours for a suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ramie suits, and metallized suits that will not wear out, are possible future developments in men’s clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Noticing the statement that Greeks and Italians can get into a coat more easily than anyone else, a test proved that to be the case. They slip on a coat with one complete motion. Their Grecian and Roman ancestors slipped on their togas in that manner, and the idea still persists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Bushido — What Is It? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Bearden C. Beace {Washington, D. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">APANESE patriotism is as old as Japan herself. It was born in the first tribe in the remote ages of prehistoric antiquity. It developed into puberty under the clans and the early imperial governments. It reached manhood in the long period of the Japanese middle ages and then settled into the sleep of a hibernate. In 1868 the “flowery kingdom” threw off the last shackles of feudalism and stepped into occidental modernity. A dormant patriotism again sprang into existence, an existence invigorated by several centuries of sleep under the secure peace of almost perfect isolation. The new patriots, not satisfied with their ancient heritage, added a kultur to the revived bushido. They were students of Prussian kultur and Bismarck. The military Satsuma and Choshu clans, whose combined military strength overawed all the other clans, formed a government of bureaucratic absolutism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The revived bushido, injected with kultur, gave Japan her nominal constitution; it gave her a central government built on the remnants of the mikado’s “divinity”; it brought the abolition of caste; it gave her universal education under government supervision; it gave her industries, commerce, science and first rank with the great nations of the world. The new bushido brought her victory over her ancient enemy in 1894, and gave her Formosa and suzerainty over Korea. In the early years of the present century, the Japanese athlete, inspired with bushido, leaped upon corrupt Czarist Russia and defeated her before the czar could bring his tremendous power into effective action. Bushido, the superpatriotism, defied and defeated the most powerful nation in Asia; it defied and defeated one of the most powerful nations of Europe, and now it has defied the League of Nations and each individual nation in the world. The new bushido has plunged Dia Nippon headlong into undisguised militaristic imperialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sword and all it represents is the heritage of the Japanese people. To express it in the words of Count Okuma, “The sword is the spirit of the Japanese.” Ilosohoko-Chitaru-no-Kuni, the ancient name of Japan, when translated means “land where the slender blade is sufficient in all things”. The “bushi” and the “samurai” (military men, warriors) of medieval Japan worshiped their swords as the palaces of their souls. The greatest punishment that medieval justice could inflict on the warrior was to confiscate his swords. In an ancient code of laws death was placed second to confiscation of swords in the list of punishments for crime. Death by the sword was honorable: death by execution was a profanation of ancestral honor. The conscript of modern Japan endeavors to emulate his ancestors and conducts himself with the thought of posterity uppermost in his mind. “Endeavor to emulate your ancestors and conduct yourself with the thought of posterity uppermost in your mind” is the patriotism of Japan in one sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “bushi” and the “samurai” were the Asiatic parallels to the knights of medieval Europe. Bushido was the Japanese code of chivalry. It was a code of military discipline and ethics invented by the feudal lords (diamos and shoguns) of Japan and instilled into their warriors. It developed a spirit of devotion, loyalty, blind obedience and duty to clan, lord, country and emperor. Bushido was the spiritual force urging the warrior on to the attainment of perfection in horsemanship and the use of arms. The “bushi” who could not master the art of jiujitsu (which incidentally was invented by a Chinese) was removed from the military roster. Their oaths were similar to those of the European knights and exhorted them to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Respect deities, esteem Buddha, and raise the fame of your family;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strive for the favor of your lord; Abhor timid and effeminate deeds; Practice plainness and economy ; Eschew everything vulgar and indecent; Keep your promises;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear not a powerful enemy;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Disdain not a weak enemy • Be faithful unto death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(The above is the code of Yoritomo, who became shogun in 1184.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Codes like this combined with the Japanese military “Golden Rule”, “Receive arrows on your forehead, but never in your back,” developed a national patriotism which enabled Japan to maintain her independence and territorial integrity while Europe was falling an easy prey to the same Mongolian invader. “Sword in hand, with the Kami (heavenly beings who created and protect Japan) overhead, our ancestors subjugated the savage aborigines. Sword in hand, with the Kami overhead, we defeated our invaders and enemies,” is how the Japanese express it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bushido lias been revived in Japan since the restoration. It has been sublimed into a patri</span><span class="font5">otic </span><span class="font6">kultur built on the ‘'divinity'’ of the mikado. Iler people are taught to blindly respect, reverence and obey the “son of heaven” even unto death. Family tics snap at his call. Japanese life is subordinated to duty to emperor and country. The rille, the bayonet and the machine gun have replaced the swords of the samurai as the palace of the soul of the Japanese soldier. The soldier who has flinched or failed in the face of danger commits hara-kiri as did his ancestors to prove the sincerity of his efforts. The Japanese are always faithful to the emperor. They inarch to death or to victory under the oriflamme of the “son of heaven”, inspired to patriotic intoxication with the fervor of the revised and modernized bushido.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ancient Japanese were a people of sentiment, art, poetry, music, literature, gorgeous decoration, flowers and beauty. Theirs was a civilization of lavish caprice and warm emotion, an age of the pen and the lyre. ^Medieval bushido was mortally fatal to this flowery life of a former civilization. Spoons wore supplanted by chopsticks, butter was given up, hats and shoes were discarded, women’s long flowing sleeves wore shortened and hair-dress was introduced, skirts were abolished in favor of less cumbersome pajamas, gorgeous colors were despised, decoration degenerated into the use of one dark rusty tint, and the pen was discarded for the sword. It became unbecoming for the “samurai” to indulge in art, literature, drama or music. It became undignified to laugh or weep or outwardly display one's emotions. Extravagance was the source of all evil. Want and the restraint of desire, and self-denial and frugality, became virtues. Honest industry in the workshop or the rice field became derogatory; the sword alone was honorable. Loyalty, bravery and patriotism flourished in this age of self-control and selfdenunciation. A nation of sentiment was transformed into a nation of will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">OW many people know, I wonder, of the curative properties of olive oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word “cured” is a strong term, but when one is lifted up to strength and usefulness for several years, that one is, in common parlance, cured. I personally know of more than one being relieved of liver trouble, and even cured of gall stones, by use of olive oil, when given up by the M.D.'s, not even an operation being held out as a hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There are two ways of taking the oil. The first and most effective way is to abstain from all food after twelve o'clock noon, and instead of the regular evening meal, take a laxative, such as senna tea, and an enema. In three or four hours or when ready to retire for the night, drink a tumblerful of the oil (warm or cold).

Don't mind even though you are more nauseated than you have ever been before, because a great cleansing and healing of the mucous membrane of the entire alimentary passage is going on. In four or five hours take more senna tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This treatment may weaken you considerably, but this is because of the great elimination of poisonous matter that for years has been storing up in the system. When recovered from this temporary weakness you will feel like a new person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the trouble has been of long duration, several treatments will probably be necessary, taken a week or twm apart. Each successive treatment will be less discomforting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In case of pneumonia, when the M.D.’s drugs were having no effect in reducing the temperature, the writer’s temperature wrns reduced to normal, and continued thus, by only one of the oil treatments as above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second method of taking the oil, as a general builder and for rapidly putting on flesh, is to take three or four swallows just before retiring at night. Lie on right side, and though you may be nauseated for a while, this will pass, and you will enjoy sweet, refreshing sleep. Olive oil is absolutely harmless in whatever quantities it may be taken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Tropical Disease “Elephantiasis”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By G. G. Campbell, Oph.D. {Tahiti}</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS account of my experience in the tropics relating to the disease known as “elephantiasis'’, begins with a coincidence that occurred over twenty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time it was my custom to go each afternoon, about throe o’clock, to a certain eating place known as the “American restaurant’’ to have tea and some delicious Chinese cakes such as only the Chinese seem to know how to make. The American restaurant was run by a Chinaman by the name of Charlie Wong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the occasion referred to I happened to be the only customer, and as I sat there enjoying tea and cakes Charlie Wong sat at another table close by sipping tea as the Chinese are wont to do. Just to create a conversation I said to Wong, “Charlie, how is it that the Chinese are such tea-drinkers?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Well,” says Charlie, “in many parts of China, if we do not boil our water we get the big leg, and, as we do not like the taste of boiled water, we put tea in it to give it a flavor. But if you will take notice you will see that we do not drink strong tea; we put in just enough tea to give it a flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From that time on I could not keep the thought from my mind. For many days thereafter I kept thinking about Charlie Wong’s expression “get the big leg”, which I realized must have reference to the disease we call the “elephantiasis”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I came to the conclusion that if drinking boiled water would keep a Chinaman from getting that disease it would do the same for anyone else. My mind became so thoroughly imbued with the idea that I decided to make an investigation and see if here in Tahiti, where we have over three thousand Chinese, any of them could be found who had the disease. For many years I have searched and investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have talked with hundreds of people, making inquiry as to where I could find a Chinaman who had the elephantiasis. I succeeded in finding two, but, in each case, upon investigation I found that he had not followed the Chinese custom of never drinking water unless it was boiled; therefore I was compelled to eliminate them from the investigation the same as though they had been of some other nationality. The same held good with a few cases of half-caste Chinese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is apparent to the observant that the disease known as elephantiasis is caused by a germ in the ground, in all tropical countries, and which, if taken into the system by drinking spring water that has had no opportunity of purification by running a sufficient distance in the open, or if getting into the system in any other way, is apt to cause a fever as a commencement, after which in some cases it causes a growth which, sometimes, reaches enormous proportions. My investigations have covered a period of over twenty years, and the following are my conclusions :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the elephantiasis is a disease that is entirely unnecessary for anyone to have if one is willing to take the precautions stated herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If one lives in a tropical climate and where there is spring water that has not had a chance to run a sufficient distance in the open to kill the germ, or, in other words, to purify the water, it must be boiled if one wishes to avoid this disease; but there are other precautions that must be acted upon as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever there is a spring you will always find a marshy place below it where the spring water oozes around, causing a wonderful growth of water grass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people who own such a place cut their water grass as it is required and sell it each day to the Chinese baker as he returns from delivering his bread. When cutting this grass they are compelled to go into the marshy place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If on one’s feet or legs one has a cut, sore or abrasion that could come in contact with the swamp, the germ can as readily catch in it as it could in the stomach by one’s drinking unboiled water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I know of one white man who bought a place on which there was such a spring, and previously no one had ever lived on the place for six months without contracting the disease. He tried out my theory, with the result that for three years he was immune. Then, like others who have a lot of this kind of water grass, he used to go into the marsh and cut a wheelbarrow load each day for the Chinese baker. Eventually he got an injury on his shin bone which made a had sore for some time. At last two pieces of bone came out and the sore healed; but the harm had been done. He had been careless and had not always protected the sore sufficiently to keep the germ out. When the germ did get inside it was exactly the same to him as though he had taken the germ inside by drinking the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another important thing to mention here is that concerning the malarial mosquito.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not my intention to speak in a detrimental way concerning our doctors, as, for all I know, they may be important to us, but I am going to hazard the guess that the “malarial mosquito” idea has been overworked. I have no doubt that the malarial mosquito </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font6"> carry the disease if one happens to get upon an open elephantiasis sore and then immediately goes from that to another person and inoculates him with the germ. I can fully believe that to a very small extent such could be the case; but take notice, if the malarial mosquito is the only source through which we can annex the elephantiasis, as is claimed by present-day doctors, why is it that practically all cases of elephantiasis have their inception at places where there is a spring such as I have mentioned, or in some place where water comes out of the ground and does not have an opportunity of becoming clarified through sufficient passage in the open ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another worthwhile thought is the fact that a mosquito is no respecter of persons. He will bite a Chinaman as soon as a native or white person. If the malarial mosquito is the only source of contamination, as is claimed by our present physicians, why do not the Chinese have the disease as commonly as the native or white man ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thoughts suggested here and the facts presented are too potent to be cast aside without very serious consideration and research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am aware how prejudiced most of us are against the Chinese; and doctors, being almost human, have the same natural prejudice against them and therefore prefer not to accept an idea of 1 his kind if it comes from the much maligned Chinaman; but should we not have a much more open mind, when it comes to the general health and benefit of mankind, and accept any source that may actually be of service? Of course the suggestions herein have nothing to do with curing the disease after it has been established, and herein must be the efforts of our physicians. Their investigations must be kept up until they have reached the remarkable goal of being able to completely cure the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in the meantime let us adopt the method of the Chinese, that as far as possible we may avoid the disease, and then we shall not require the cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When I was a boy the doctors used to bleed their patients for any and all complaints. In our present day they poohoo such an idea. It is an even bet that in the day of our grandchildren practically none of the present methods of curing ( ?) disease will be used, but instead will be hooted as badly as the “bleeding” method. Let some medical student who is not yet so set in his ways and methods that he cannot see any way but the one that was taught him take up this very important effort in behalf of mankind. I have photos of several bad cases of this disease, and will send them free to any M.D. who will take sufficient interest to make a careful study of this terrible disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Note: The above reference to cutting grass in the marsh and contracting elephantiasis through getting an injury on the leg reminds us of a post-card picture sold in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, about the year 1919, showing a poor lad lying in a hospital bed and with his two legs swollen to enormous proportions by this disease. The sale of these photo post cards was in order to provide money to pay for the treatment of his case by the doctors. How had he come by this terrible affliction? He had been swimming in the Licking river near where it empties into the Ohio river at Cincinnati, and got cuts or abrasions on his legs. The Licking river is at times very muddy or filthy-looking in appearance, and has sinks and suckholes. Shortly thereafter the elephantiasis developed in the young man's injured limbs.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Montreal’s Campaign Against Diphtheria</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font6">AST winter Montreal waged a brilliant campaign, designated as a “Campaign Against Diphtheria”. Luder that title seven doublecolumn editorials appeared in the Montreal </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Baily Star.</span><span class="font6"> Each was signed by a different M.D. Three had the additional letters D.P.H. after their names, and one was an LL.D. One described himself as an epidemiologist, one as a director of the University Clinic, one as a professor of pediatrics, one as Superintendent of the Division of Contagious Diseases of the City Health Department, one as the Superintendent of the Child Hygiene Division of the Health Department, and one as the Director, Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine of McGill University, The editorials were probably all written by the serum firm that supplied the necessary tools of trade, and if that kind of campaign would not sell a lot of serum we cannot think of anything that would.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark270"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark271"></a>Obedience Brings Honor from God</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">T CAN he set down as certain that all who will enjoy the grace of everlasting life must learn to become wholly obedient to the fountain of life, Jehovah God. At some time, soon or late, they must get to the place where the doing of His will becomes their chief joy or they will cease to live. All can see that this is as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today's lesson is about a man who seems to have learned this lesson thoroughly, and to have practiced it well. It is the story of the faithful high priest Jehoiada, who served in the reigns of Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah and Joash, and who contrived to live through the interregnum between Ahaziah and Joash when his stepmother-in-law, Athaliah, was on the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time Jehoshaphat came to the throne, Jehoiada was a man of about sixty years of age; Jehoshaphat himself was a young man of thirty-five. These two good men could not have failed to know each other well and to have had a good influence upon each other. Probably Jehoiada’s influence was the dominant one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, was the bad son of a good father. Such things sometimes happen. In this instance the reason is clearly discernible, and is supplied in the Scriptures, lie married the wrong woman, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, and for this, no doubt, Jehoshaphat was somewhat to blame.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark272"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>“Like Mother, like Daughter”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">If Ahab had married a decent woman he would probably have been a decent man; but Jezebel was an ambitious, murderous idolater, and made him so. Between them they put Naboth to death and appropriated his vineyard. Athaliah was like her mother and her father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first thing Athaliah's husband, Jehoram, did when he ascended the throne was to murder all his own brothers; a strange thing for a man to do. What would induce any man to do such a fiendish thing? Nothing but the evil influence of a selfish, cruel, murderous wife. She was determined that their child, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font6"> child, should be sure to come to the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">She reasoned that the safest way to ensure that would be to have all the heirs to the throne put to death, and so we read of Jehoram her husband that “he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font6"> lie had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of [Jehovah]&quot;.—2 Chronicles 21:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time Jehoram murdered his brothers </span><span class="font5">. . . there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying. Thus saith [Jehovah the] God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, but hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, whieh were better than thyself; behold, with a great plague will [Jehovah] smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy noods: and thou shall have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day bv day.—2 Chronicles 21:12-15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark274"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>Athaliah Spared for a Greater Abasement</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">All that was prophesied in the writing of Elijah came to pass upon Jehoram, some of it at once and some of it later:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover [Jehovah] stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: and they came up into Judah, and brake into it. and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and Ills sons also, and his wives [except Athaliah] ; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz [Ahaziah], the youngest of his sons. And after all this [Jehovah] smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness; so he died of sore diseases: and his people made no burning for him, like tl e burning of his fathers. Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired; howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.—2 Chronicles 21:16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among Jehoram's wives above mentioned as having been carried away was one woman who evidently was a good woman and had brought up a daughter that was a credit to her, a daughter that more resembled her grandfather Jehoshaphat than her father Jehoram. That sometimes happens, too. The traits of grandparents, suppressed for some reason in parents, will crop out in their children. This is a law of biology, originated by the Author of all life, our marvelous Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This unnamed wife of Jehoram was the mother of Jehosheba, and she in turn was the wife of the aged high priest Jehoiada, and an excellent wife, too. How it came about that Jehoiada at about eighty-five years of age wedded a young woman of not more than twenty-five, we do not explain. Such things happen. The marriage may have taken place ten years before Jehoram’s death, at ages seventy-five and fifteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At any rate the Lord Messed the union of Jehoiada and Jehosheba and used them both in a remarkable manner in carrying out His purposes. Their son Zechariah, when he came to manhood, died a martyr’s death, a true and faithful witness to Jehovah God. To have reared a son like that is a great honor to come to any man and woman, and reflects favorably upon both parents.—2 Chronicles 24: 20, 21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark276"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>Jehosheba Thinks and Acts Quickly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">After the death of Jehoram (his father) Jehoahaz (Ahaziah or Azariah) ascended the throne, and while on a visit to his cousin, Jehoram, then ruling in Samaria, he was slain by Jehu, who was at that time exterminating all of Ahab’s house. While he was gone Athaliah ruled the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately, when she learned of the death of her son, Athaliah, being a thoroughly selfish and unprincipled woman, yielded to the suggestion of the Devil that she slay all her own grandchildren and then seize the throne for herself. The Devil’s idea, of course, was to put an end to David’s house, and thus make God out to be a liar.—2 Chronicles 21: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a bright idea, but it did not work. Young kings in those days had many wives and many children, and Ahaziah was but twenty-three years of age when he died. In murdering her grandchildren Athaliah missed her count, somehow, and somebody besides the Devil knew’ about the promises that had been made to David, and stepped out on those promises, and God blessed her in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehosheba was too quick in thought and action for her murderous old stepmother. The account says of little Joash (probably the youngest son of Ahaziah) that she “stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber”.—2 Chronicles 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It -was a ticklish piece of business, stealing one of the heirs to the throne, and escaping with it from the palace, with that old virago jealously v’atching every exit. Suppose the baby should cry on the way out? Suppose the old lady should find out that one of the grandchildren is unaccounted for? Suppose she meets her on the way out? Suppose somebody saw her snatch the child and put it into her bosom? Suppose the nurse should disclose the secret? It would mean sudden death for both her and the child. But the angels M’ere all around her as she fled.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark278"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>Jehoiada Shows His Faithfulness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehosheba went with her burden to the safest place in all the world. It w'as safest for many reasons: God had put His name in the temple; He had acknowledged it as the place where He ■would meet with His people; she was bringing W’ith her the only living heir of the royal line of David and Solomon, and God had indicated His special interest in such; her own husband was the high priest and would be able to give her wise counsel and assistance, and she would have his protection to the extent that he could give it; the temple contained living quarters w’here she could secrete the babe and nobody need know of it except herself, her husband and the nurse; and Athaliah would not be likely to intrude. She never came near the temple, for she was not a worshiper of Jehovah God, but of Baal, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can be sure that Jehoiada gave his courageous little w’ife a royal welcome, words of commendation, no doubt, and we may be sure that together they rejoiced before Jehovah God, and praised His name, and thanked Him, and sought His guidance as to what course they would best pursue with their peculiar charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoiada could have spirited the child out of the country, but there v’ould have been some risk of detection, both on the outward and on the return journey. The child wms already W’here it was safe; it should stay there. Nothing could happen to it except by divine permission. Meantime they would bide their time and watch the providences of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be that Jehosheba had little ones of her owm, possibly several of them; we know<sup>7</sup> that she had sons, for they are mentioned. (2 Chronicles 23:11) So, although little Joash W’as hid in the temple for six years, it does not necessarily mean that he was all that time without any playmates. Meantime Athaliah ruled over the land.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark280"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>Athaliah Reaps Her Reward</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoiada did the wise thing in letting Athaliah go ahead and show how little she knew. No doubt the angels did their part to help everybody see that she was a mere tool of the Devil, and one of his fools. (Psalm 111:10) By the end of six years they had seen enough to satisfy them and were eager for a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was not until then that Jehoiada made the situation known to live chosen men, and they in turn went out and brought in all the Levites of the kingdom into Jerusalem. A carefully prepared plan was arranged, which included the concentration of a large and concealed force in the temple by the expedient of not dismissing the old courses of priests and Levites when their successors came to relieve them on the sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God. And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of [Jehovah] : and she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets; also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason!—2 Chronicles 23: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is it, you know. It was not treason when she induced Jehoram to murder all his brothers; and it was not treason when she herself murdered all her own grandchildren, or thought she did; but it was treason as soon as the idea percolated through her skull that her own life was in danger. That was treason sure enough.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>Makes Us Think of Big Business</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Athaliah makes us think of Big Business, as we have known it here in the United States. Suppose you were asked to make a list of the men who in the past generation have done most to advertise their patriotism, whom would you put on the list?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certainly you would have to put on the list Charles M. Schwab, donor of millionaire bonuses of other people's money, and assistant wrecker of peace conferences; Samuel Insull, custodian of Chicago morals and business ethics; Charles G. Dawes, that other’ brilliant statesman who found $80,000,000 so ready to his hand; Owen D. Young, who would lend $2,000,000 of other people's money without giving it a second thought; Charles E. Alitclrcll, wizard head of one of our largest banks, and shining example for the youth of the land, forking over millions to people who had not a shadow of right to it, and juggling his own income taxes, etc., etc. It is a good thing that Kreuger was a Swede; otherwise we would have had to listen to lectures on patriotism from him too. And then there is Hoover, too; we had almost forgotten the name. And Morgan, and Rockefeller, and Ford. The list is interminable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It certainly is a strange thing that the men at whose hands America has suffered its greatest outrages have been the loudest advocates of patriotism, and have had, and still have, the most to say about how the country shall be run. And when they suspect that the jig is about up, and they fear that justice may be administered, their first thought is like that of the old woman who was near the end of her rope. They cry, Treason, Treason!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Athaliah had lived during the World War she would have worn trousers, been a “dollar-a-year” ‘’man”, a prominent church member, a member of the chamber of commerce, a 100% (profit) American, and been an insider on every cost-plus scheme afloat. She lived too soon to reap the full reward of her type. But she got what was coming to her.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>Jehoiada Was Faithful to the Lord</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoiada had good reason to have a poor opinion of Athaliah. Had she not decimated and well nigh destroyed the royal family around which the divine promises centered, and done it twice? Was she not a foreigner, a despiser of Jehovah God, and a worshiper of Baal? Was she not a daughter of the hated Jezebel, and of the almost equally hated Ahab? Had not her course deprived his own children of the ministrations of their own grandmother, and driven her off into captivity? Had not both he and his wife been in jeopardy of their lives for six years, all on account of this hateful woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there was nothing personal in the execution that followed. The time had come when Athaliah must die, and in the few moments that were left to her she had a chance to think of the ruthlessness of her course in destroying her brothers-in-law and her grandchildren. Je-hoiada acted promptly and with the dignity befitting his high office. He would not allow the temple to be defiled, but the execution should not be delayed :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso fol-lowetli her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of [Jehovah], So they laid hands on her: and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there. And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be [Jehovah’s] people. Then all the people went to the hous’e of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.—2 Chronicles 23:14-17, 21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>God Signally Honored Jehoiada</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said on one occasion, “I receive not honour from men” (John 5: 41), and followed it with the question, “How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?” (John 5: 44) It is apparent that Jehoiada was one of those who had the right attitude of mind and heart on this subject. The honor that comes from men is not worth having. The source from which it springs is low, and the motives which animate it are often unpraiseworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoiada is not mentioned in the Scriptures until the time when he was about eighty-five years of age. Quietly he had gone about the duties of his office, discharging them faithfully, not seeking in any way to draw attention to himself, wholly desirous of doing God’s will. Probably he had often prayed that he might be made more useful. His prayer -was answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His own wife, a child in years compared with himself, came suddenly to him, fleeing from a murderous monarch, and bearing in her arms the little mite of humanity around whom so many of the divine promises centered. He hesitated not. He took the child in, cared for him, shielded him from harm and made him king, and then we have the testimony of Jehovah God that “Joash did that which was right in the sight of [Jehovah] all the days of Jehoiada the priest”. (2 Chronicles 24:2) That is honor enough for any one man. It shows that, in Jehovah’s sight, Jehoiada was the real ruler of the land. His influence was paramount throughout all the rest of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At length the time came when this patient, faithful old man was worn out in the service, and there came another honor to him at life’s close. Some of the kings, including Jehoiada’s own father-in-law, Jehoram, were not counted worthy to be buried with the kings (and that was true of Joash too), but Jehoiada had the rare distinction of being counted as a king in his death:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And they offered burnt offerings in the house of [Jehovah] continually all the days of Jehoiada. But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.—2 Chronicles 24:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Which is better, to aspire for the honors of men, as Athaliah did, and go out as she did, an object of age-lasting shame and contempt, or to seek only the honor that comes from God, as did Jehoiada, and find, at the close of the way, that “thy faithful wall; [with Him] hath reached to Zion's height”? Oh, the latter is the better way! It is! It is 1</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark288"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark289"></a>The Clever “Crucible” Scheme</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">F ALL the clever schemes for making a fortune, it would be hard to equal the Philadelphia “Crucible” scheme. It has in it every necessary element to make a huge financial success for its backers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fundamental idea back of it is that in every home there are keepsakes and other valuables that can be turned into cash. The question is how to get hold of them with a minimum expenditure of real money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At length the clever mind that was back of the idea thought of the preachers. These men have nothing to do to occupy their time; they are always hard up; why not go and make a deal with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The job of the preacher is to make the women scour their homes and bring out all their treasures. In the elaborate, beautifully illustrated printed material, used to assist the process, these treasures are described as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Watches, chains, rings, lockets, brooches, medallions, pendants, cuff links, bracelets, spectacle frames, cameos, pins, old and abraded coins, dental scraps such as crowns, bridges and plates, sterling pieces and old jewelry of every description.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old-time burglar had to go out and risk his neck breaking into a house. After he was in he had to find the valuables, and run the risk of getting caught on his way out. After he got out he had to dispose of the loot. We can all see now how crude wore his methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The best the old-time burglar could do was to rille one or two homes in a night. The modern method is far superior. A slick talker gets up in the pulpit and harangues as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Long ago Paul wrote: ‘The fashions of this world pass away.’ Think of the watches, rings and other jewelry worn in other days and which are now tucked away in our homes idle and forgotten, useless. In our Crucible, you have a chance to give all these fragments a life that will endure forever in the work of the Master. It is our plan to reclaim the gold for the needs that press so heavily upon the church in these days. How many things there arc to do, for our missionaries in far away lands, for our church maintenance [meaning the preacher’s bread ticket], for our less fortunate friends and fellow Christians. Let us gather up the fragments. Let us dig out the gold in the mine which the households of this congregation represent. Let us resolve that these old things shall no longer sleep as mere dead metal but shall awake as a living force in a Christian world. Gather up the fragments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The children are pressed into it. The pretty little folders, nicely worded by astute advertising men, are passed out to them, and they go home and hound mamma until she gets out the last thing in the house that has gold or silver in it. The kids never get a rake off. They work freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In due time the swag is brought in. The preacher has done his work. He is entitled to his commission. The congregation gets something; the advertising man and the printers get something; but the rest is so easy that it makes an honest man’s head ache to see how the modern crook can in no time make a fortune, and that without the least bit of risk to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All he has need to fear is that, rarely, some editor may expose the scheme. This scheme, perfectly legal, perfectly unprincipled, perfectly crooked, is sweeping the country. A few unusually capable confidence men are using the preachers, the women and the kids to clean out every home in the country, and getting away with it, hands down. 0 Lord, how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">To Call in Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">respected and influential institutions and accepted practices is not calculated to make a magazine popular among all classes. Nor does THE GOLDEN AGE presume to say or to publish on its own authority indictments of widely recognized and generally condoned perversions of the truth. It takes its stand unequivocally upon the Word of God, and makes its appeal to all who believe that Authority and to all those who, perhaps unconsciously, from a simple love of the right, seek to do the things that are right. Such will doubtless appreciate this and subsequent issues of THE GOLDEN AGE.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">J</span><span class="font9">EHOVAH’S organization is universal. His capital organization is his Christ, having and exercising the chief office in all of his organization, and over which Christ Jesus is the head, Jehovah God being above all. On the earth there is a small company of persons wholly and completely devoted to Jehovah God, and the chief delight of these is to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This book contains a brief report of the activities of the earthly representatives of Jehovah for and during the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1932. A summary of the work done throughout the entire field, which is the earth, is set forth herein. Its publication is for the benefit of those who have a sincere interest in seeing the government of righteousness established in all the earth over which Christ Jesus reigns.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font9">It is not at all presumptuous to say that Jehovah lias a few representatives on the earth who are doing his work. It is written that his spirit bears witness to those who love him that they are his and are members of the organization of The Christ, if so be that they suffer as Christ Jesus suffered and have the zeal peculiar to the house of Jehovah. (Rom. 8:16,17) Events that have come to pass during the year 1932 are further strong and corroborative proof that the little company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus now on the earth are the children of God and jointheirs with Christ Jesus in his kingdom and will participate with him in that kingdom if they continue faithful to the end. Christ Jesus suffered persecution in bearing testimony to the truth of God’s Word. During the year past his faithful followers on earth have suffered a similar persecution because of their fidelity to God in bearing witness to his truth. In addition to the suffering of persecution which they have undergone, these faithful ones have also had a wonderful manifestation of God’s favor bestowed upon them, particularly in the way of illuminating his Word for their encouragement and well-being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the end of the fiscal year Jehovah’s remnant on earth delight to come aside for a short season and consider the opportunities of service which they have had during that year and the many blessings enjoyed by them. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font9"> furnishes just such an opportunity for recalling these blessings, because it brings together the facts and reminds the anointed of their experiences and enables the various ones to see what their brethren in other parts of the earth have been privileged to do in bearing the fruits of the kingdom to others. These faithful ones have learned and appreciated as never before the great truth that Jehovah is God above all, that the vindication of his name is the all-important thing, and that his kingdom will accomplish that great work. They see and appreciate the fact that the time is at hand that all creation must know that Jehovah is God, and they delight to have an opportunity to bear this testimony to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another feature of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font9"> that is helpful is the daily Scriptural texts selected for consideration, one for each day. In addition to designating a text for each day, a brief explanation of each of these texts appearing in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and other publications is put alongside the text for the edification and help of those who love the Lord. At the beginning of each day the faithful remnant give consideration to the text for that day in connection with the year text. The text for the year is especially appropriate, as will be seen from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> Without doubt the Lord directs the selection and consideration of these particular texts. As the Lord provides food for the mind of each one of the remnant and these go forth to the performance of their duties they are refreshed and uplifted and strengthened for his work. Since these texts are from the Word of God, and the comments give honor to Jehovah, all those who love righteousness will find a comfort in the daily consideration of the same. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font9"> is therefore commended to all who desire to feed the mind upon food convenient, that is to say, that which is upbuilding and helpful. The president’s annual report presented at the annual meeting of the corporation Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society appears herein.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>PRESIDENT’S REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">To Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every person on earth who is wholly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom now appreciates the great privilege of bearing testimony to others of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. A witness is one who bears such testimony to others. Jehovah’s witnesses are charged with the duty of bringing this good news of the kingdom before the rulers and the peoples of earth, advising them that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God and that his kingdom is the only relief for the world. They delight to tell the people that Jehovah’s kingdom will be a complete relief and bring blessings beyond the fondest hopes of any worldly mind. Each member of Jehovah’s organization on earth is keenly interested in what his brethren have done during the year 1932. It is my duty and my great privilege at the close of this fiscal year to bring to your attention the things that have been reported to me by the various field workers in telling the good news of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and previous issues of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font9"> explanation has been given of and concerning the corporate and the divine organization for the carrying forward of the kingdom work on earth. Some seem to have had much difficulty in getting the proper understanding thereof, if they ever read what was published. Another attempt will be made here to make the matter plain and clear for the benefit of those who really desire to know and to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s organization is complete within itself, to be sure, and needs nothing, but Jehovah’s covenant people are in the world even though they form no part of the world. As long as on earth they cannot avoid coming in contact with the world. They must obey the laws made by the nations of the world, when such laws are not in conflict with Jehovah’s law. In order to escape from thus doing, as the apostle has thus stated, “then must ye needs go out of the world.” (1 Cor. 5:10) The fact that God’s people comply with the reasonable laws made to govern man on earth is not the slightest evidence that they have any part with the world or that they are seeking aid and help from the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Jehovah directed his Messenger Christ Jesus to give special attention to things pertaining to the earth, and to do the work foreshadowed by Elijah, and to do this before coming to his temple, the Lord began to use some men then on the earth who were devoted to him. Among the faithful followers of Christ Jesus so used was Chas. T. Russell, who early saw the necessity of forming a corporate organization under the laws of the land in order to hold title to the necessary property to be used in carrying forward the Lord’s work in the earth. He therefore organized Zion’s Watch Tower Society, the name of which was subsequently changed to Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. This corporation was created and organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. In so doing the organizers of that corporation in no wise went down to Egypt for help, as some foolishly claim. They were only taking advantage of existing conditions to fortify the work on earth against the encroachments of enemies. Enemies did arise and did try to take possession of the property belonging to God’s people, and had not a corporation been holding the title thereto they no doubt would have succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord expects his people to help themselves and do what they can do by exercising reasonable care and prudence; and when they have done all they can, then he does for them what is necessary. The corporate organization, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, is merely an instrument of God’s people to hold title to things material while carrying forward the work which Jehovah God has given into the hands of those who are devoted to him. Some legal qualification must be named in the charter of the corporation in order to determine how the corporation can be operated and how officers thereof may succeed each other. The law requires that the corporation, by the vote of certain members, shall enact by-laws and elect its officers. Those who knew Brother Russell know that he was devoted to the Lord, and the presumption must be indulged that the Lord’s spirit directed him in deciding what the qualifications should be and to insert the same in the charter of the corporation. Some legal qualification is necessary in order to determine who shall vote, and this was done in harmony with the law under which the corporation was formed. The qualification provided that there should be one vote cast'by each one who contributed the sum of ten dollars to the funds of the Society, and the by-laws provided that in addition thereto each one voting must be in complete harmony with the work in which the Society is engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the Lord’s children have not been financially able to contribute to the funds of the corporation, and hence have not voted for the selection of officers when the annual meeting of the corporation is held. That makes no difference, however. The right to vote does not add anything to one’s standing before the Lord. If the Lord’s organization functions, and one has a part therein, what difference does it make whether he is permitted to cast a vote at a corporation meeting or not? If the organization or corporation required by law continues to exist, and thereby the title to the property of God’s covenant people is held in security against enemies, what does it matter whether one casts a vote or not? During the lifetime of Brother Russell on earth he directed the election of officers. This was always done by a few members acting in complete harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1917 there was a great noise made by opposers of the Lord’s work, and the question was raised as to who should be selected to fill the offices in the corporation and to direct the work of the Society and as to the manner of carrying on that work. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> then announced a specific day on which all the eeclesias or companies of God’s people throughout the land were asked to meet together and east their votes for whomsoever they would have to manage and direct the work of the Society. The qualifications required for a voter at such meeting was full consecration to Jehovah God. At that time the holy spirit was performing the functions of advocate for the peoples of God on earth. The various companies of faithful ones met on that day, and after prayer, as the Scriptures provide, they proceeded to cast their votes for their choice as to who should manage and carry on the work of the Society. All those who have faith in God must indulge the presumption that God’s holy spirit guided his people on that occasion and that their selection was in harmony with Jehovah’s will. The vote of the companies or eeclesias on that occasion disclosed an overwhelming sentiment in behalf of the ones named, as will appear from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> of December 15, 1917. If we believe that the spirit of the Lord on that occasion directed his people, then we must conclude that the selection of servants was in harmony with his will, and until he indicates that there should be a change the anointed of the Lord would make no attempt to make a change. Each one will have in mind that the Lord directs his own affairs. Each one of the fully consecrated desires to do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shortly after that general expression of the Lord’s people by vote cast, as above mentioned, the qualified voters of the corporation of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society met at its regular and annual meeting and selected the same officers or servants named by the overwhelming majority vote of the consecrated, and thus the corporation acted in exact harmony with the Society from the divine viewpoint. There has not appeared to men a better way to determine these questions than was used then. If the Lord has a different way he will reveal it in his own due time. The charter and by-laws of the corporation require election of officers, but that in no wise affects the Lord’s selection. If, then, the qualified voters of the corporation fully concur in the vote cast by the Lord’s fully consecrated and devoted people, then it would seem that that was an expression of Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1909 the earthly headquarters of the Lord’s work were removed to Brooklyn. It was then deemed necessary to organize a corporation under the laws of the State of New York in order to meet certain legal requirements where the Society’s property and work would be located. This was done, and the Peoples Pulpit Association was organized at the instance of Chas. T. Russell, who requested a lawyer to write the charter of that corporation. Just about that time enemies of the Lord’s work, who were opposing Brother Russell, tried to oust him and put some of their favorites in the position of managing the corporation and the work of the Society. The lawyer preparing the corporation charter was asked if it was possible to prevent the opponents from hindering the work done in the future by and through the Peoples Pulpit Association. The result was that the charter of this latter corporation was so drafted that it provides that the president shall hold his office for life. The real purpose of making that provision of the charter was to prevent the enemies of the Lord’s work at that time from interfering with the property belonging to the Society and used to carry forward the Lord’s work on earth. Evidently the Lord directed this to be done. The membership in that corporation is limited, and the qualifications are in harmony with the law for the election of officers to a corporate body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Later a corporation was formed and organized under the laws of the British Empire and under the title and name of International Bible Students Association. That corporation was formed specifically to enable the Lord’s people to hold title to property in Great Britain and to carry forward the work particularly in England and other countries of the empire without interruption. The members of that corporation are limited and work in exact harmony with the other corporations. The faet is that the three corporations, the Wateh Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Peoples Pulpit Association, and the International Bible Students Association, are all managed and controlled by practically the same officers, and work together in exact harmony and for the same end. The Lord’s blessing has been upon that action, and he has manifested his approval of this arrangement. The three corporations above named hold title to the property of Jehovah’s people on earth, but this does not at all mean that Jehovah’s people are acting under authority from Satan’s organization. On the contrary, Jehovah’s people have taken advantage of the laws of the land in order to estop or prevent the enemy from doing them injury or hindering them in the use and operation of property owned by God’s faithful people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are now in the world, but we are not of it. This does not mean that God’s people are not privileged to take advantage of the laws of the world to prevent injustice from being practiced upon them. The Apostle Paul set this precedent when he took every advantage of the law of the land to prevent injury from being done to the Lord’s work. The Lord’s people would not be using common sense or the wisdom which comes to them from above if they should take any other course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These corporations are not Jehovah’s organization, within the strict meaning of that term. They are earthly organizations of Jehovah’s people put up as a barrier against those who would do them injury if they could, and the Lord expects his people to take advantage of what means is within their power to protect themselves. The organization of Jehovah on earth is made up of those who are anointed by his spirit to carry forward his work. The approval of such is in no wise affected by their privilege to vote or not to vote at a corporation meeting. The approval of these should come and does come from the Lord. When we speak of the “Society”, therefore, as representing God’s work on earth the meaning is that the Society is made up of Jehovah’s anointed people now on earth who are wholly interested in obeying his commandments in announcing the kingdom. If the property needed to carry on the work is held for such and used for that purpose, what difference does it make whether the officers who manage that property are elected by a dozen persons or by a multitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some have made the very unwise suggestion that title to all the Society’s property should be put in the name of the president. That would be a very foolish or unwise course to take. Others have suggested that the title to the property should be held by a board of trustees. That also would be a very unwise course to take, especially when the Lord has shown a better way. Suppose the title to all of the property should be held by an individual or several persons in trust. In the ease of the death of such person or persons then the Society would be compelled to go into a worldly court and have another trustee or trustees appointed to hold title to such property. The corporate method of handling the matter is reasonable and feasible because the legal title is perpetual in the corporation, and the equity thereto is in fact in those who really form the organization and who are devoted to the Lord. The manner of selecting officers in these corporations is a very small matter. Carrying out the obligations that the Lord has laid upon his people is the important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For anyone to take the position that the Society, which is made up of God’s people on earth, is now acting under authority and power granted by the Devil’s organization discloses his unsound reasoning, to say the least of it. That same person who would raise such foolish objection would go to the state and obtain a license for his automobile, and surely he would not take the position that he is running his automobile by authority from the Devil. What the man really does to obtain an automobile license is to comply with the law governing the people and which he is under obligation to obey when that law does not in any wise conflict with God’s law.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>NEW NAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Christ has never borne a good name, fame and reputation amongst men of the world, for the reason that there is nothing held in common between the people of God and those of the world. There could not be any concord the one with the other, even as the Lord’s Word states. (2 Cor. 6:15-17) The Christ is the seed of Jehovah’s woman, his organization, and is heir to the promises of God, while those of the world are under Satan and his organization and are the seed of the enemy. It is therefore to be expected that God’s anointed people would be misrepresented and their reputation made bad by worldly men, particularly the clergy class who mix up with politics. And it is even so. It is not an uncommon thing to hear some clergymen denounce God’s people because they are known as and called “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Such enemies of God and his kingdom tell others that Jehovah’s witnesses call themselves by that name in order to deceive the people while carrying on a selfish enterprise. God knows their wickedness and their willful misrepresentation of his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For several years past those who have devoted themselves to the Lord’s cause have been designated by divers names. It was in the year 1931 that the Lord revealed to his anointed people that he had given them a new name which his own mouth had named and that the name given to them is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. (Isa. 62:2; 43:10,12) It is those composing the “faithful servant” class, who receive the anointing from Jehovah and who are placed in positions in his organization according to the will of God, that are given the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Such must be and are the witnesses of Jehovah and bear the fruits of his kingdom to others that such others might know that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The anointed ones of Jehovah on earth are also designatedCby him as the “remnant of his people”, meaning that out of the great number that have made a covenant to do God’s will only a small number remain true and faithful at the time of judgment. It is this class of faithful witnesses that constitute the organization of Jehovah on earth, and which we frequently call “the Society” because such are the ones forming a society or company of people wholly devoted to God and to his kingdom. No one on earth has the ability, power or authority to say who are the various individuals composing the anointed of the Lord God. The Lord himself knows who are his own. When Jesus says, “By their fruits ye shall know them,” then we can in a measure determine, by the course of action one takes, as to whether or not he is the Lord’s. Whether those who are the Lord’s own have the privilege of casting a vote at a corporation meeting that controls the visible property of God’s people on earth is of little importance. They must stand or fall to the Lord, and their standing will be determined by their faithfulness. The Lord will see to it that his property is used for the furtherance of his cause, and that is all the interest any of his people have therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The faithful servant class, being anointed and sent forth as the witnesses of Jehovah, now busy themselves in performing the duties and obligations of their covenant in obedience to God’s commandment. They appreciate the commandment of the Lord that now is the time when this good news of the kingdom must be preached to all the world as a witness to the nations and that this must be done with zeal and energy before the final overthrow of Satan’s organization on earth. .These faithful ones are doing this very work, and doing it with joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">A minister in the Lord’s service is one who is devoted to God and his kingdom and who ministers to others who desire and who need help. These ministers carry the message of the kingdom to all as they have opportunity. Each one who is anointed by Jehovah is thereby commissioned as a minister of God. His commission is specifically set forth in the Scriptures. The Society, acting in harmony with the expressed word of the Lord, designates certain ones who appear to have reached maturity in Christ, and are therefore elders according to the Scriptures, as ministers ordained and sent forth to perform certain duties amongst the anointed and for the people who desire to hear the truth. Among those who are thus ordained and sent forth are the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s remnant or servant class on the earth is one, and, being located in different sections of the country, they are formed into companies, and these meet together as a congregation for study of God’s Word and to better equip themselves for the field service. Everything with the Lord is orderly, and in keeping therewith these various companies appoint and designate certain ones to perform specified service in the company. Heretofore we have proceeded upon the theory long held by Christians that each congregation should elect elders and deacons. The Lord at the temple of Jehovah has made many things clear to his people in recent months, and amongst these things is the truth concerning servants of the companies. We have learned that elders are not made by the votes of others, but by growth to maturity in Christ, and that deacons are not provided for by the Scriptures. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> of August 15 and September 1 set forth the Scriptural proof in regard to this matter, with which you are familiar. The church must come to unity at some time, and the facts show that such time is now here. All action or work of the church should therefore be harmonious. The New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses, at its regular meeting on October 5,1932, adopted the model method of organization and work. The resolution providing for such organization is as follows:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RESOLUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Brother Rutherford was requested to draft a resolution for the New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses governing the local organization, which he did, and on October 5, 1932, by unanimous vote the following was adopted by the full congregation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses, desiring that its official organization shall be entirely in harmony with the Scriptures and fully concurring with the resolution published in September 1 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> adopts the following method of procedure and action:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This company is devoted to the active service of Jehovah, and every member thereof does and by His grace will continue to engage actively in the field witness service as opportunity is afforded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All persons selected to fill any position in this company, and all persons who vote to fill such positions, shall be fully devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom work as now carried on in the earth by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. We now provide for the following official servants of this company, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A service director, to be appointed by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and selected from amongst the names of three persons submitted by this company to said Society. The duties of said service director are prescribed by said Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A chairman, to preside at any or all meetings of the company. A general chairman shall be selected by the company at its annual meeting, to hold that position for a term of one year, but the company may have another elder brother in the chair at any meeting when so desired. In the absence of the chairman another brother may call the meeting to order and the company may select the chairman for that meeting. The chairman shall perform the duties commonly devolving upon one holding that position and in harmony with the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A service committee, to be composed of seven members of the company all of whom must be elders within the meaning of the Scriptures. This committee shall serve in that capacity for a term of one year and until their successors are selected by the company. Vacancies in the committee shall be filled by the company at any meeting thereof. Any one or all of the members may be removed by the company upon the ground that they are out of accord and out of harmony with the service work of Jehovah as carried on by his organization. The company hereby confers upon the service committee the following duties, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To fully and harmoniously cooperate with the service director in organizing and carrying forward the field service under the direction of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To serve in an executive capacity, and to that end perform the duties heretofore performed by the executive committee of this company. The service committee shall fix the time and place of study meetings and other meetings of the company and name the leaders thereof and shall designate the ones who shall address the company in a public discourse on the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The service committee, with the advice and approval of the company, shall appoint an assistant director and a stockkeeper and such other assistants to the service director as may be necessary. The service committee shall also appoint all necessary subcommittees to carry forward the work and the affairs of this company. Other duties may be assigned to the service committee from time to time as the company may determine. All actions of the service committee are subject, of course, to the approval of the company, in whom the Scriptural authority to act resides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A secretary of the company, who shall be an elder brother and who shall keep the records of the company as required. He shall also serve as the secretary to the service committee and shall perform the duties devolving upon a secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A treasurer, who shall be an elder brother and who shall receive, safely keep, and upon proper voucher pay out, the monies or funds of the company. He shall keep the different accounts in the book of accounts, showing from what source funds are received and to what particular work they are appropriated. The company reserves the authority to change or add to these regulations at any meeting called for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>WITNESS WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">No company has the exclusive privilege of determining the manner of carrying on the witness work in any one community. The entire field for work is under the jurisdiction of the Lord, and the responsibility to give such witness on earth he has placed upon his organization on the earth. It is the duty of the Society, therefore, to prescribe the order of carrying forward the witness work in all portions of the field. To this end the Society sends forth to each company organization methods or plans for doing the field witness work, and all the companies follow such plans, and the work is therefore done in unity. There could be no other proper way to do it. Jehovah’s organization is one, God and Christ Jesus are one, and now the body members are one with God and with Christ Jesus in full harmony with the prayer uttered by Jesus to Jehovah. (John 17) Unity means the organization of the Lord operating in exact harmony, having one primary objective in view, which objective is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. This must now and will be accomplished. For this reason all in Jehovah’s organization have a part in that work, and in harmony therewith it is written: “And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. ’ ’—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The radio is God’s provision for making known his purpose. The radio is not the invention of man, but until Satan’s organization is destroyed Satan through his agencies will continue to operate the major number of the radio stations. In God’s due time he will take entire charge of the radio and use it to his glory. The Lord now permits his anointed people to make some use of the radio as a means to make known that Jehovah is God and that the kingdom is here. Satan would prevent all such use of the radio if the Lord did not intervene for his people. By the grace of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">there has been a wide witness work done by the radio during the year. Thus he has advertised his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More than 340 radio stations have broadcast the kingdom message each week during the year. This has been done chiefly by electrical transcription. These speeches are prepared and recorded at Watchtower. The records are then made and sent to the various radio stations. By this means a harmonious message of the kingdom is given throughout the earth. During the year the message of the kingdom has in this manner been broadcast in Australia, South Africa, Canada, Cuba, Esthonia, France, and also reaching into England, and in practically all the United States and in most of the countries of South America. There has been a tremendous response from the people to these radio speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each daily mail at the Brooklyn office brings hundreds of letters from interested persons who have heard the message by radio, and many of these ask for more information and for books explaining the kingdom. The oppression now suffered by the people has caused many more of them to seek comfort, and the Lord has graciously provided such for those who sincerely desire to know the truth. During the year the Brooklyn office alone published 75,000 catalogs to supply the demand for information concerning the Society’s publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the regular weekly broadcast of the transcription lectures an occasional national network of radio stations simultaneously broadcasts the speaker’s lecture. On the 26th of June (1932) such a network of stations was used to broadcast the lecture “Can the American Government Endure?” The stations on that occasion covered only the eastern portion of the United States and parts of Canada. Within a short time thereafter the Brooklyn office alone received more than 12,000 letters from newly interested ones asking for copies of the lecture and more literature. Many of these sent the money along to help carry forward the witness work and for the sending of additional literature to their personal friends. More than 150,000 copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine containing that lecture were sent to the people, and that was not sufficient to supply the demand. The presses of the Society, being busily engaged in other matters, have been unable yet to supply the demand for this particular lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The radio provides an entry for Jehovah’s witnesses into the homes of the people. It is a very common occurrence for the people to say to these witnesses, in substance: “We have been waiting for you to come with the books that we have heard mentioned over the radio.” Field workers report that in the poorer sections seemingly almost every one is listening to the radio lectures. One instance is here given to illustrate how the common people hear the truth. A pioneer working in a community shortly following the above-mentioned radio network broadcast was offered a glass of water by everyone called upon. The reason for this was given in these words: ‘We heard the speaker say that it is the privilege of anyone to give a glass of cold water in Jehovah’s name, and it is the least that we can do to thus serve you.’ The common people of good will are hearing the message of truth, and they recognize that God’s kingdom is their only relief. It will be complete relief and will bring joy to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A large amount of money is required to carry on this radio work. Some of the radio station managers have begun to recognize that it is a great privilege to broadcast the message of the kingdom and that such is of greatest public interest, convenience and necessity. Hence they are broadcasting the message without charge. The most of the stations, however, must be paid. The small amount of money received for the books is used to print other books, and the additional money needed to carry forward the kingdom message is supplied by voluntary contributions by those who love the Lord and his kingdom. The Lord has put into the hearts of his people a willingness to make some financial sacrifice in order to have a part in telling suffering humanity of God’s provision for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Kenite Jonadab, the son of Rechab, taught his offspring to serve God. (Jer. 35:14; 2 Ei. 10:15) Throughout the land of “Christendom” there is now a class of people who have respect for God and his Word but who have been hindered by the clergy from serving God, but who now wish to serve him. They see the great abominations that are committed in the religious organizations in the world that bear the name of the Lord. They also see that Jehovah’s witnesses are telling the truth. This class was foreshadowed by Jonadab, and these are now getting into the chariot or joining themselves to Jehovah’s organization and going along with Jehovah’s witnesses to have some part in the witness work. They are not of the remnant, and make no claim to having received the anointing of the Lord, but they are of good will, and there is no good reason why they should not have a part in telling the message of the truth to the people. It is the privilege of Jehovah’s witnesses to encourage them to participate in any way they can to give the witness. This is in exact harmony with the words of the Master recorded at Revelation 22:17: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” Many of the Jonadab class are hearing the message of truth by radio and are taking hold upon the message and carrying it to their neighbors. Some of this class now gladly contribute food and other necessities to aid Jehovah’s witnesses who are busily engaged in declaring the judgments of the Most High. The kingdom work marches majestically on regardless of all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While this report is being written at Watchtower, Staten Island, amidst the golden autumn leaves, it comes to mind that just ten years ago this week the land at Watchtower was bought with a view to building a radio station to broadcast the truth. Radio was then little used in America or elsewhere. Many were the harsh criticisms uttered because of the purchase of this land, but such criticisms did not deter the forward action in building the radio station which, since built, has broadcast the truth of the kingdom. Radio station WBBR is the Lord’s station, and he has put his blessing upon it. By his grace it has been permitted to broadcast the truth continuously since it was erected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this connection it may well be said here that the land above referred to, and which has been the Society’s property since purchased as above mentioned, in addition to providing a place for broadcasting the kingdom message, also produces much food for the kingdom workers. During the year the garden has furnished food for the Bethel family over a period of five months and has produced three crops of beans and an abundance of other vegetables. In addition to the daily consumption, more than seven thousand quarts have been preserved for winter consumption by those who operate the machines to produce the literature. For all of these things gratitude is here expressed to the great Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Approximately 200 persons comprise the Bethel family. The home is maintained and operated at a minimum expense consistent with wholesome food and decent living. The members of the family are grateful to the Lord for his provision for them and for the opportunity of participating there in his work. Each one stands on an exact level. There are no bosses, but all strive to carry on the work in harmony and in unity. Work is regularly done at least eight and one-half hours per day, and such time as possible is spent by the members of the family in the field delivering the kingdom message by bearing the fruit of the kingdom to the people. Each Monday evening the entire family assembles </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font9"> study of the prophecies, and this study is a great blessing'to them. Wednesday evening a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study is conducted for the family. Other evenings are used for study, and on said evenings members of the family meet at different places with the New York company of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is called the “Bethel” family because it is the family at the house of God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>MANUFACTURING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord has graciously provided the machines and other equipment for the manufacture of the literature necessary to carry the message of the kingdom to humanity. Publication plants are maintained and operated by the Society at Brooklyn, Toronto, Bem, and Magdeburg. Literature is produced in more than forty languages, and at the Brooklyn factory alone publications are sent forth in thirty-three different languages. During the year thirty-nine different books and booklets were published at the factory, and in the different languages aggregate 194 different publications, as shown by the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">During the working days of the Brooklyn factory the production averaged every day was, to wit, 10,453 bound books and 42,506 paper covered booklets. This is a decided increase in production over the previous year. While there are regular hours for work at the home and in the factory, the members of the family organization never hesitate to work extra hours when the necessary occasion arises. With the anointed the motto is: “Let us get the work done according to the will of the Lord.” Often the machines must be operated at night as well as by day, and this is joyfully done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The workers at the Adams Street (Brooklyn) factory and office number 140. Each one of these attends strictly to his own duties, avoiding talking, and they do not waste time. Constantly the music made by the sweet hum of the machines is heard by the workers, and they keep in time and in tune therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year the Adams Street (Brooklyn) factory has produced 18,655,847 copies of books, booklets and magazines. This is the greatest amount produced by this factory in any one year. The bound books are somewhat less because of the greater necessity and demand for booklets, the which are largely increased. In order to make a true comparison of the work accomplished during the year at this factory it is well to have a common unit. The factory bases its figures on a unit of sixteen pages. The following comparison will be considered with interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1931 the production of books and booklets totaled 10,996,246, equivalent in 16-page units to 107,567,564.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1932 the quantity of books and booklets produced totals 14,405,072, equivalent in 16-page units to 111,153,979.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the books and booklets, the factory produced 2,168,000 copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine, equivalent in 16-page units to 8,672,000. The same year, 1932, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font9"> 1,296,275 copies, equivalent in 16-page units to 2,592,550. Also Spanish magazine, 786,500 copies, equivalent in 16-page units to 1,573,000. This shows an increase in 1932 over 1931 in production of 16-page units to the number of 5,940,045. If these 16-page units were reduced to books, that would show an increase of bound books to the number of 270,000 over the previous year; or if the same number of units were put in booklets it would mean an increase of 1,485,011 booklets over the previous year. The production represents 194 different books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the foregoing the Adams Street factory produced during the year 16,000 calendars, 75,400 catalogs, 8,389,295 office forms, letters, bulletins, etc. Radio folders for announcing the kingdom were produced by this factory to the number of 14,352,100. Thus the factory produced in office forms, folders, and catalogs, and such like, the total of 22,832,795 pieces, and this shows an increase over the previous year of 6,627,770 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year the office and factory have been privileged to manufacture thirteen new booklets, and two new clothbound books, to wit, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font9"> Book Two and Book Three, and also to print ready for binding the first edition of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font9"> the third elothbound book. The message contained in the booklets is brief and pointed and is easily grasped. The booklets are the most beautiful the Society has ever compiled for' distribution in this form. Because of shortness of money amongst the people, and great oppression, these booklets meet a demand that comes from the people. Shipment of these booklets began only in August, and at the end of September nearly two million of them are in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World </span><span class="font9">during the year reached a grand total of 5,636,328 copies printed at the Brooklyn factory alone. It was published in twenty-eight different languages at Brooklyn. Taking in all countries, it was published in forty-one different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year there have been produced at the Adams Street (Brooklyn) factory 406,489 books in foreign languages. Clothbound publications were made in English and forty-eight other languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>MATERIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the machinery which the Lord has so graciously supplied to his people, he has also furnished during the year the material used at the Adams Street factory for the production of the foregoing publications. An endeavor is made to purchase these materials in the most economical manner. During the year an average of two earloads of materials was delivered to the factory weekly. During the year 106 carloads of paper and cardboard were hauled to the factory by our own trucks and used. Carloads average 40,000 pounds. The paper used during the year totaled 1,952 tons. In addition thereto the following other material was used: 162 tons of chip board; 234,254 yards of cloth; 1,959 rolls of gold leaf, each roll being 650 feet long; 83 barrels of paste; 40,596 yards of crash • 612 spools of thread; 15,505 pounds of glue. For its own use we have made and used 33,039 pounds of ink and 148 gallons of paint.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The factory supplies the English books and some of the foreign language books for the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Jamaica, Australia, and Africa, and a limited number to some of the other countries. In addition to the stock kept at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, the Society maintains a shipping depot at St. Louis and at Oaldand. During the fiscal year shipments from these three places to all points above mentioned, including those to local workers in America, reached the grand total of 13,750,707. These shipments to the various places or parties were as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To branch offices 5,125,823 &nbsp;To auxiliaries &nbsp;&nbsp;738,080</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To companies &nbsp;&nbsp;3,890,307 &nbsp;To individuals &nbsp;101,353</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,895,144</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The number of books shipped must not be confused with the number placed in the hands of the people by the workers in die United States. During the fiscal year these field workers alone placed in the hands of the people 6,834,483. It will be observed that the shipments above mentioned exceeded the shipments for the previous year to the number of 3,553,396.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The demand for the books written and first published since 1923 has materially increased each year, including the fiscal year just closed. These books are designated by the factory as “Jr” books in order to distinguish them from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> or books previously published. During the year 1931 there were shipped of the “ jr” books above mentioned the total of 2,373,769; whereas in 1932 the shipment of the same totaled 3,660,301. This shows a substantial increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The shipment of books by the Society for the year 1931 totaled 6,844,532; whereas for the year 1932 the shipment from the same three points in the United States, as above mentioned, totaled 8,144,923; which is also a substantial increase over the previous year. Of all the books sent out during 1932 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font9">Book One takes the lead for the year, the shipment of which totaled 622,270 volumes. The two other </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font9"> books were issued only during the latter part of the year, but before the end of the fiscal year 181,944 of these had been sent out, and the presses continue to make more as fast as the capacity of the machines will permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of the booklets sent forth, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World</span><span class="font9"> takes the lead, the shipment of that booklet during the fiscal year totaling 5,223,306. During the latter part of the year the Society published the following new booklets, to wit: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Who is God? What is Truth? Cause of Death, Hereafter, Good News, Liberty, The Final War, What You Need, Health and Life, Home and Happiness, Keys of Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The greater number of the books and booklets sent out from the Brooklyn factory during the year were delivered to workers in the United States, where the major portion of the work has been done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>FRUITS OF THE KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Instructing his followers as to their proper course Jesus said: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” (John 15:8) On another occasion he said to those who claimed to be serving God, but who were not: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. ’ ’ (Matt. 21:43) The fruit of the kingdom is not man’s fruit. It is God’s fruit, because it is provided by Jehovah and is life-giving and life-sustaining to those who partake of it. The fruit of the kingdom is God’s Word of truth which is provided for the life of creatures. Only those who accept the truth of God’s Word can live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The books that are written and manufactured and shipped out are not the work of men. These books merely gather together the facts which are known to be true and which have come to pass and then are placed alongside the prophetic utterances set forth in God’s Word, and which facts show that divine prophecy is either fulfilled or in course of fulfilment. No doctrine or teaching of any man is set forth. The .Scriptural proof is all from Jehovah God, and he has caused to come to pass or else permitted to come to pass the events or facts in fulfilment of prophecy. These truths are necessary to be known by those who would have life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The greatest message that the people can have is of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. His name is of all-importance, and his kingdom will vindicate his name and bring the desire of all those who love righteousness. Therefore the message contained in the foregoing mentioned books is, in fact, the fruits of the kingdom, and it is the expressed will of God that such fruits shall be exhibited to the people that they may have an opportunity to accept the truth and take their stand on the side of Jehovah and righteousness. To ‘bear these fruits’ means to take the message to the people and call their attention to the fact that Jehovah is God and to inform them of his purposes, as expressed in his Word. Jehovah has anointed his remnant company of people on the earth to do the work of bearing these .fruits of the kingdom to the people. The message that the kingdom is here, and that God has set his King upon his throne, and that this great King, at the instance of Jehovah, will destroy wickedness and enthrone righteousness for ever, is good news to mankind, and therefore is the gospel of the kingdom. Jesus said to his followers: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) Jehovah caused the World War to suddenly cease in 1918 for the very purpose of permitting his anointed servants to bear tins message of the kingdom, which is the gospel of the kingdom, to the peoples of the nations as a testimony to them. Since the beginning of the preaching of this message of the kingdom it has increased and many more people have heard and rejoiced,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work of preparing and manufacturing books and shipping them is a part of the work of bearing the fruits of the kingdom and is necessary to be done before the message can be handed to the people. The radio is employed, by the Lord’s grace, to let the people know that the kingdom is here and that more can be learned about God and his kingdom by reading what is printed. Then follows the little army of God’s anointed ones, each one of whom is commissioned to preach the good news or gospel to those who have a desire to hear. This little company of anointed ones must also declare to the people the truth concerning the day of the vengeance of Jehovah. Jesus declared that he would commit to his “faithful and wise servant” class on the earth all his goods or kingdom interests and that this he would do at the time he comes to the temple of Jehovah and gathers to himself the faithful ones. ‘The kingdom interests’ means that the duty and obligation is laid upon the servant class to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">bear the fruits of the kingdom before the people, and those who are devoted to the Lord God and who do this work joyfully glorify the name of Jehovah God. For this reason Jesus said: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.” The ones who zealously and earnestly engage in this work and do it because they love God and his kingdom are the ones that honor the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Companies of God’s anointed people are gathered together and organized into units for active and unified service in the field of bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the people. Some of these companies are quite small, while others contain a larger number. All divisions of the anointed, however, are at unity and work together harmoniously and to the same end. For this reason it is both proper and necessary that someone of the organization should direct the activities in the field service. This work is done from the main office of the Society at Brooklyn. The literature is prepared and shipped out to the various workers, and at the same time the workers are given detailed instructions as to the manner of proceeding in an orderly way to give the testimony. The books that these workers carry do not belong to them, but the title is in Jehovah’s organization and the message is the Lord’s. Those who do the work are preachers of the gospel, anointed and commissioned to do that very work, and must obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of these faithful workers travel from place to place, either alone or in small groups, and devote their entire time to the service of bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the people, and these are called “pioneers”. They go into parts of the country where no witness work has previously been done. They are therefore the bearers of the light of God’s kingdom into the dark places. Others devoted to the Lord, but by reason of personal duties, can devote only a limited amount of time to field work, and these are designated “auxiliaries”. Where there are a number of the anointed ones in a town or community these are organized into a company and devote their spare time, particularly on Sundays, to field witness work, which is preaching the gospel and bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the people. All these faithful workers call at the homes of the people and tell them in brief about God’s kingdom and exhibit to them books containing the kingdom message. This is much more convenient for the people than to assemble them in a hall or other building and talk to them. The carrying of this message to the people is preaching the gospel m obedience to the commandment which the Lord has given and which must be done, as he states, before the final end of Satan’s organization. This work of Jehovah’s witnesses is in no sense a commercial work or enterprise, nor is it a scheme to get members. There is no desire to obtain members. It is an educational work of bringing to the people the facts that will enable them to see the way to life, and thus it is the fruits of the kingdom which give and sustain life and which proceed from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal- year this work has been greatly blessed by the Lord. The workers have encountered many difficulties, and amidst all these the grace of the Lord has been sufficient and they have steadily and joyfully moved forward in the proclamation of the truth as commanded, and have thus participated in the vindication of Jehovah’s great name. The calling upon persons and telling them of the kingdom and exhibiting to such persons the publications containing the message of the kingdom is designated “giving testimony’’. From reports received at the Brooklyn office it is observed that during the fiscal year testimonies were thus given to the number of 16,434,258. That means that a large number of individuals were personally witnessed to by others. Doubtless these in turn passed on the message to many others, as the facts in many instances show. This activity in the field is the result of a determined effort of the anointed to f</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfil</span><span class="font9"> their covenant unto the Lord. It is the purpose to waste no time, but to give a brief testimony to each of those called upon, whether they hear or refuse to hear, and exhibit to them the message of the kingdom. If they desire to have one or more of the books, these are delivered and a small contribution of money taken therefor, which money is used to help defray the expense of getting this message to the people. It is true the Lord is rich, and could freely have the message carried to everybody. He could supply the money for the workers, but it appears to be his good way to let each one make a small material sacrifice as an evidence of his interest or desire to know more about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The weekly average number of workers in the field for the year increased by 1,549 over the previous year, and the average number of hours for each worker increased from 449 to 488. This resulted in a net increase in hours in the field devoted to such testimony work of the total number of 1,011,982. The number of obtainers of literature during the year reached the total of 4,579,251, which was an increase of 1,271,173 over the previous year. This shows an ever increasing interest of the people in the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must be borne in mind that the year just closed has been one of great distress amongst the people of America. Approximately eleven million people without employment; many of these who had previously drawn lucrative salaries now have approximately nothing upon which to live, and yet more of the people have turned their hearts to give a hearing ear to the message of the truth than at any previous time. This is exactly as it should be expected. The people are able to see that Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in this work for a selfish purpose but have a sincere and honest desire to help them to understand the cause of the present trouble in the world and what will be the complete remedy therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bound books placed during the year show a decrease from the previous year, but this is due to the fact that in 1931 a large number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> were distributed practically free. The distribution of the other books, which are designated “jr” books, shows an increase over the previous year in the bound books of, to wit, 34,215, and a far greater increase of the booklets. There was an increase of approximately half a million booklets over the previous year. Therefore, despite the distress and depression, there has been a healthy increase of the output of the message of the kingdom. The new booklets just received contain much information that the people really desire at this time. Up to the present time the Brooklyn factory has been unable to keep up with the demand for these booklets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year five special testimony periods were designated for a general forward movement throughout the country. These special witness periods were particularly blessed by the Lord; the friends, realizing the fact that their brethren throughout the land were engaged in a uniform and harmonious movement, went to the work with an increased zeal and earnestness. One of these periods was specially devoted to giving testimony to the rulers or official part of the United States. Of these, 123,977 received a testimony, which class includes clergymen, politicians, financiers and military leaders. The report from Washington, D.C., shows that all the senators, congressmen, cabinet officers and the president received the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet, and also fifty-nine foreign ambassadors received the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The books and booklets placed in the hands of the people by these various field workers during the fiscal year totaled 6,834,483. This was a net increase of more than 400,000 over the previous year.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Long centuries ago Jehovah by the mouth of his holy prophets foretold that Satan and his agents would conspire in the day of the Lord to destroy Jehovah’s faithful witnesses on earth. Only a short time ago God’s anointed people began to understand that Gog is Satan’s chief agent and leads in the conspiracy and in the commission of overt acts against God’s anointed people. The year just passed has furnished an abundance of facts proving not only that the wicked conspiracy of the enemy has been formed but that the enemy is moving forward against God’s witnesses in every part of the earth. The clergy of “Christendom” are the chief ones on the earth who incite others to violent opposition. For some time they held indignation meetings and caused the burning of the books, and, finding that would not work, Gog led them into other avenues of opposition. The clergy know that they have no facts upon which to base their claim to being preachers of God’s Word. They have no answer to the truth which Jehovah now causes to be told about them as false shepherds. They well know that they have used the name and Word of the Lord for their own selfish purposes. These false teachers who claim to teach the Word of God and who use it for hire hate Jehovah’s witnesses, which witnesses the Lord designated in his Word as “a holy nation”. (1 Pet. 2: 9,10) The Scriptures then represent the enemies of God conspiring to destroy those of his anointed people yet on earth and who are therefore members of the holy nation. The prophet of Jehovah, in the eighty-third Psalm, says: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.” —Vss. 2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Throughout the country these false teachers have gone to the officers who exercise police power and have complained that Jehovah’s witnesses are selling goods, wares and merchandise as peddlers or hawkers and doing so without a license. Upon such false charges they have caused Jehovah’s witnesses to be arrested, haled into court, and in many instances held in prison for many days without a trial. Often when they are tried the officers, upon gaining the facts, release them, while some have been fined and required to serve a term in prison because of failure or refusal to pay the fine. Many court officers have signified that they did not care to take a course contrary to the clergy, because the clergy form a part of the world’s organization. Other court officers have been more fearless and, desiring righteousness, have seen through the selfish movement of the clergy and have turned Jehovah’s witnesses loose. In a number of cases lawyers have been employed to conduct a defense, but little or nothing has been gained by this procedure. If Jehovah’s witnesses were acquitted it was usually on some technicality, the court avoiding to decide the real issue as to the right of the witness to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a number of cases Jehovah’s witnesses, being arrested, have pleaded for defense the provision of the United States Constitution and the constitutional provisions of the respective states where arrested, and which fundamental law guarantees the right of each one to serve God and preach the gospel in his own way. Jehovah’s witnesses have done this, not in order to receive a permit to preach, but because the law of the land thus estops officers of the nation from interfering with preaching the gospel. As Paul took advantage of the laws in his day, so now Jehovah’s witnesses plead the laws which the worldly nations have made as an estoppel preventing such officers from interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Police officers have asked Jehovah’s witnesses to apply for a license to go from place to place; but this they have declined to do, for this reason: Jehovah God commands his witnesses to preach the gospel of his kingdom, and God’s commandments are supreme and must be obeyed by his witnesses. No earthly lawmaking or law-enforcing body can properly interfere with Jehovah’s law. Jehovah’s witnesses must obey his commandments rather than man’s commandments, and where there is a conflict between the two they will choose to obey God’s commandments and suffer whatsoever consequences are permitted to come upon them. They could not be faithful to God and take any other course. They know it is far better for them to suffer the inconvenience of imprisonment at the hands of men than to suffer the disapproval of Jehovah God and destruction at his hands. No governing power of the world can properly prohibit the preaching of the gospel; therefore no such worldly authority or power could grant a permit to preach the gospel. Worldly powers have no authority in the matter one way or the other. If Jehovah’s witnesses should ask worldly authorities to permit them to preach the gospel they would thereby be going to the world for help contrary to the Word of God. (Isa. 31:1) Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire to be disrespectful to earthly rulers, but they must be obedient to God rather than to man. Christ Jesus and the apostles set them an example which they must follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the Lord revealed to his people the meaning of Jehu and his work, it began to be seen by them that Jehovah is now permitting the clergy and their allies to openly identify themselves with Satan’s organization, even as Jehu caused the worshipers of Baal to put on their vestments or garments by which they identified themselves as Devil worshipers. After those worshipers of Baal had thus identified themselves, Jehu caused every one of them to be slain. It now clearly appears that Jehovah will cause the message of his kingdom and of his vengeance to be delivered to the rulers, including the clergy, that none of these may have excuse to plead ignorance for their wrongful course of action. When these have received such notice and then openly persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, they identify themselves with the Devil and his organization and are subject to destruction, because Jehovah declares that he will destroy all his enemies.’ (Ps. 145: 20) Jehovah’s witnesses are under his care, and no harm can befall them, and nothing can come to them except by his permission. It therefore clearly appears that the Lord is permitting the enemy to persecute his witnesses now in order that the enemies may clearly identify themselves as on the Devil’s side. It is of interest to note that in connection with these arrests and persecutions during the year a number of those who engaged in such prosecution or persecution in opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses, after having received the message of God’s warning, have died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society during the y-m has sent out certain qualified and instructed brethren to gather together Jehovah’s witnesses in an assembly and to instruct them as to the proper procedure when interrupted in their work or arrested for preaching the gospel. The Lord has added his blessing to this effort. When a company of chese witnesses go into a town or city a statement is first filed with the officers having police jurisdiction, setting forth the purpose of such witnesses in coming to such place to give testimony. This statement is accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the witnesses who are there to engage in the testimony work, which list is filed with the officers. Then the witnesses proceed to give the testimony in an orderly manner. If they are interfered with or arrested and taken before the court for trial, each one makes his or her own defense, which is the guaranteed right of every one under the law of the land. To enable these faithful witnesses of Jehovah to make a proper defense, and in harmony with the Word of God, the following Order of Trial, and suggestion as to method of procedure, has been provided:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark33"></a>ORDER OF TRIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">When arrested and brought into court, the defendant should ask for the complaint to be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then ask the court to show you the ordinance or statute under which you are arrested. Get a copy of this.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark35"></a>APPEARANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Any defendant is entitled to appear in court and defend himself or herself without the aid of counsel, if so desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When called upon by the court to plead to the charge, make the following statement: “I plead not guilty.” The order of trial will then be in the following manner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The State or prosecutor must first put in the evidence for the prosecution. Any witness going on the witness stand may be cross-examined by the defendant. When the prosecution has completed its case, the defendant should make the following motion to the court, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“If it please the court, I move the court to dismiss this complaint for the reason that it does not state facts that constitute an offense or violation of the law. All the evidence fails to show any guilt on the part of the defendant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the court denies or overrules the motion, then let the defendant proceed to put in his defense. Being sworn in, ask to make a statement of your case to the court. You are entitled to read your statement, if you so desire. You can say to the court, ‘‘In order that I may get this matter clearly before the court, I have written out my statement and ask permission now to read it.” Then proceed to read the statement as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I am a true and sincere follower of Christ Jesus, who is the Son of Jehovah God, and I have consecrated myself to do the will of God and to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. At the time of my arrest I was obeying God’s law and not violating any law of the land. The courts take judicial notice that the Bible is the Word and law of Jehovah God and is the highest authority governing man. The express purpose of Jesus’ coming to earth was to bear witness to the truth for and in the name of Jehovah God, who is the Creator of the universe, and this is stated in John 18:37. Being in a covenant to do Jehovah God’s will and commanded by the Scriptures, as stated in 1 Peter 2: 21, to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, I am thus doing and am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The specific command given to me in the Scriptures as noted in Isaiah 43:10-12 and Isaiah 61:1, 2 is to be a witness to Jehovah God in declaring his message of his kingdom. I am therefore under this authority a duly ordained and authorized minister of the gospel of God’s kingdom and it is incumbent upon me, in obedience to God’s law, to preach the gospel. I am going from house to house acting strictly in obedience to that law and commandment of God, preaching the gospel of the kingdom to the people. Christ Jesus, the chief witness on earth, and his disciples did exactly the same thing. Matthew 10:7-15; Acts 20:20. When Jesus was on earth he emphasized the importance of the kingdom of Jehovah God and that it would bring about righteousness and peace in the earth; and he especially instructed his followers to pray for the coming of that kingdom, and told them of the peculiar conditions that would exist on earth at the time of the coming of the kingdom. As set forth in his great prophetic statement in the 24th chapter of Matthew, he stated that this important date would be marked by the coming of the great world war, followed by much perplexity and distress on earth, and in this connection he gave specific command to all his followers to preach the gospel, which commandment appears in the following language, in Matthew 24:14: ‘And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This work of giving the witness or testimony to the people is of so great importance that no one devoted to Jehovah God can refuse or neglect to obey his commandments to testify to others. These events mentioned by Jesus began to come to pass in 1914, and now we have reached that time of great depression, distress and perplexity that has laid hold upon all nations, and this is proof of the fact that the time is here in which Jehovah’s witnesses must preach the gospel of the kingdom by going from house to house. Jesus pointed out, in Matthew 24:20-22, what would follow the completion of this testimony work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This is no time for the erection of buildings for the purpose of assembling in them and going through a form of worship, but it is the time to go from house to house and tell the people the good news of God’s kingdom, which is the only possible relief for suffering humanity. I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses following this proper course and I am going from house to house with the message of the kingdom that the people might learn the truth, and to show them that relief is near at hand because Jehovah God’s kingdom will take charge of the affairs of the earth. This message is too important, and the time is too short, to cover the whole work in a few words; hence the message of the gospel of the kingdom has been put in printed form setting forth these facts and citing the Scriptural authority to enable the people to sit quietly in their homes and inform themselves of and concerning the real meaning of present-day world distress and of the kingdom that will bring the relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a corporation created and organized according to law for the very purpose of carrying on this religious and Biblical instruction by preaching the message of the Bible in printed form. I am a member of that organization, and working with others in it. It is not an organization for money profit. It publishes this message of God’s kingdom in book form and I and others carry this message in printed form to the people and exhibit it to them, not to get them to join any organization nor to get their money, but to inform them of the truth. The books are not mine and I am not selling them. We take a small amount of money to aid in the publishing of other like books because the work cannot be carried on without some financial aid. What is received for the books is far less than the cost of carrying on this work of educating the people, and this deficit is made up by voluntary contributions of men and women who are anxious to preach the gospel of the kingdom in obedience to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It must be conceded that the purpose of the law of the land is to protect the people against evildoers. In no sense of the word am I an evildoer, but rather I am putting forth my best endeavors to do good. Being commissioned and specifically commanded by Jehovah God to go and deliver the gospel message of his kingdom to the people, I have no alternative. I cannot be faithful to Him unless I obey. The Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of------as well as</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">other states prohibit the enactment of any law that will abridge the liberty of a follower of Christ Jesus in preaching the gospel, and for this reason any municipality or other lawmaking body would be estopped from making a law that would interfere with or hinder the work in which I was engaged at the time I was arrested. I am not engaging in this work for the purpose of building an organization; nor for the purpose of obtaining joiners; nor from any selfish purpose, but purely and simply in obedience to the divine law in bearing testimony to the peoples of the world. Whether the people hear or do not hear is not material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Bible plainly points out that eases similar to the one now before the court would arise in these present days, because it is written, in Mark 13:9, as an admonition to Jehovah’s witnesses, these words: ‘But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils [courts]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.’ The question at issue is not a new one. The early disciples of Jesus were brought into court on a charge identical with the one before this court against these defendants. The disciples, Peter and John, were the defendants in that case; and it is recorded in Acts 4:19 that they answered the court in these words: ‘Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.’ When again these two disciples were brought into court on a like charge a member of that court gave wise counsel to his fellow members of the council, and his language is recorded at Acts 5: 34-39, to wit: ‘Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. ’ As a defendant before the court I stand exactly in this position and freely admit that at the time of being arrested I was going from house to house, preaching the gospel of Jehovah God’s kingdom by means of exhibiting to the people that gospel message in printed form. My right so to do is clearly laid down in the Scriptures. The State is expressly estopped from interfering with such work, by virtue of the fundamental law of the state and of the nation. If the state or municipality has no legal right to interfere with such preaching of the gospel, then manifestly no one of the state or municipality could have any right or authority to issue a permit to do that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It could be no wrong to do such work on Sunday, because it is doing what God commands; and Sunday is a more appropriate day, because the people are in a better position to hear the message. I must obey Jehovah God’s law because it is superior to any law that man can make; and if the court insists upon inflicting punishment upon me because I am obeying God, then the court must take the responsibility before Jehovah God. I therefore submit my case. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then, if, after hearing the testimony, the court ‘finds you guilty’, make this statement: “I appeal from the decision of the court and request this court to see that the appeal papers are properly provided for me. I am not able to hire a lawyer, but I am entitled to the protection of the law. I ask the court to fix the papers of my appeal so that my case can be properly heard in a higher court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the court refuses to prepare an appeal for you, then go to some local lawyer and ask him to arrange for your appeal and see that the case is appealed to a higher court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then notify the Brooklyn Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Following such dignified and orderly procedure 01 the part of Jehovah’s witnesses puts the officers on notice that these witnesses of Jehovah claim to represent and do represent Jehovah God, and such officers, after receiving such notice, will be accountable to the Lord for their course of action, and he has promised to recompense all such for whatsoever they do toward his witnesses. The witnesses of Jehovah bear in mind that their mission and commission is to give testimony to the name and kingdom of Jehovah in the earth, and all persecution of them for so doing causes them to stand out in bold exhibition as the witnesses of Jehovah God. The proper understanding of this matter has given the workers much courage and strength, because they proceed, as they believe, according to the will of God. They know that they love God, and that he has called them according to his purpose, and that therefore according to his promise he will cause all things to work together for their good. (Rom. 8:28) These faithful ones delight to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and will do so, by his grace, in the face of all opposition from the enemy. Jehovah is their strength and song and the power of their salvation, and they will delight to sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year eighty-two service conventions were arranged and held by and under the auspices of the Society, at which there was a total attendance of 18,000 workers. The interest and enthusiasm manifested by these workers has been a great inspiration to one another and to other faithful ones in the field. They have appreciated the fact as never before that God has taken out from amongst men a people for his name and that it is the privilege and duty of such to be witnesses to Jehovah and that this is the time for such witness work to be done. These faithful workers have been greatly encouraged by the revelation of truth which the Lord has brought to them through the unfolding of prophecy as set forth in the publications of the Society. They have come together at these assemblies for the purpose of encouraging one another and together engaging actively in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each one of these conventions has been attended by a regional service director. During the year twenty-four brethren have engaged in the regional service work amongst the English and the speakers of oth,er languages in the United States. These have engaged in the work the aggregate of 5,375 days, and haye served 2,839 different gatherings. In carrying forward their work these regional service directors have traveled the aggregate of 307,719 miles. The Lord had richly blessed this feature of the work during the year. It is the duty of these regional service directors to help the brethren to organize the work and to carry it forward. They are not sent out to give advice concerning other things. Their assigned duties are to aid in the service work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">This report should take notice of the faithful ones at headquarters who are members of the Bethel family. During the year the home and factory have been closed on certain days during the special service campaigns. Practically all the members of the family have actively engaged in the field work during these service periods. The result of their efforts is that 4,109 bound books and 19,585 booklets, or a total of 23, 694, have been placed in the hands of the people in and about greater New York. In addition thereto brethren from the Bethel family have served 452 companies at service meetings during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>PIONEERS AND AUXILIARIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the year many of the brethren have been aroused to their great privilege of giving all their time to the service. This has resulted in a gradual increase in the number of pioneers. During the year 1,997 have engaged in the pioneer field service. The highest number of pioneers and auxiliaries engaged in the service is 3,008. This shows a splendid increase during the year. The pioneers and auxiliaries together have delivered testimonies during the year to the number of 5,981,739, the greater number of which the pioneers have delivered. This represents an increase over the previous year of 3,093,765 testimonies. They have placed much more literature in the hands of the people than they did in previous years. These faithful witnesses of Jehovah enjoy great privileges. Their hardships are greater than others’, they encounter more difficulties, hut all of these are counterbalanced by the increased privileges and the greater joy. It is not our duty or privilege to exalt any creature, but it is entirely proper to speak with pleasure and commendation of those who have so faithfully put their shoulder to the wheel and gone forward in the work during the year just closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the notice was given that a special witness was to be served upon the rulers of the land the pioneers and auxiliaries joyfully responded and within one month placed with these clergymen, politicians and military officers 47,662 pieces of literature, serving them with notice of Jehovah’s kingdom. These faithful workers in the field are required to practice the strictest economy in order to keep on in their work. They are not engaged in the work for any pecuniary profit, but because God has commanded his faithful ones to do this work, and they love him and delight to obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the United States there is a total of 3,074 counties. Of this number 1,755 counties have been assigned exclusively to the pioneers, and in 1,319 counties there are sharpshooters and company members at work. Out of all the counties in the United States only 408 have not received the witness during the past year. Most of these 408 counties were worked during the last part of the previous year; so that it can be said that the country has been well covered in recent months.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>OTHER TERRITORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the forty-eight states of the nation, the United States, the work is conducted from the Brooklyn office in the following other territories: Alaska, Bahama Islands, Canal Zone, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dutch Guiana, Guatemala, Hawaii, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Porto Rico, and Salvador. Within these last named territories twenty-one pioneers and six auxiliaries have been engaged in the service and have placed in the hands of the people a total of 40,994 pieces of literature. They have witnessed to 84,856 persons. In the bleak country of Alaska two pioneers have participated in the work, placing a total of 1,710 books and 1,963 booklets, working 667 hours, and giving testimony to 3,023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One pioneer has worked 22 weeks in the Bahama Islands and distributed 1,378 books and 1,311 booklets, making a total of 2,689 pieces of literature, in 401 hours’ time, and with 527 people. Nine hundred and ten testimonies were given. In the Canal Zone there have been one pioneer and one auxiliary working during the past year. They have placed 6,847 pieces of literature, of which number 4,638 represents books and 2,209 booklets. These two brethren devoted 1,917 hours in the work, delivered 10,650 testimonies, and placed literature with 2,571 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Costa Rica there have been four brethren in the work during the past year, two being pioneers and two auxiliaries. One has now dropped out of the work. These brethren placed 1,026 pieces of literature in the hands of 626 people. Of this number 415 were books and 611 were booklets, and 2,566 testimonies were given. In Cuba there have been seven participating in the work, and five pioneers and one auxiliary are still in the work there. These brethren have reported a total of 4,390 hours in the work, in which time they have delivered 28,232 testimonies, leaving literature with 5,802 persons, 2,135 books, 4,444 booklets, making a total of 6,579 pieces of literature they have placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Dutch Guiana one pioneer has been reporting each week throughout the year, placing 15 books and 1,008 booklets, or a total of 1,023 pieces of literature. He has reported 1,222 hours, 381 testimonies, and 457 persons obtaining the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Guatemala one pioneer has been reporting for 42 weeks, during which time she has distributed 2,478 pieces of literature in 1,294 hours’ time. Gf this number 782 were books and 1,696 were booklets. The testimony was delivered to 6,991 persons, of whom 1,745 took some of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two pioneers have been working in Hawaii, and in 3,688 hours’ time they have delivered 16,876 testimonies, and 6,410 persons appreciated the message enough to take some of the literature; consequently 5,042 books were placed and 6,789 booklets, or a total of 11,831 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Panama two pioneers and one auxiliary have been in the work, one pioneer having recently dropped out. These reported 1,331 pieces of literature placed with 1,017 persons as a result of having given 5,031 testimonies in 1,118 hours. Of the total literature, 514 were books and 817 booklets. For 20 weeks one pioneer has been working in Peru, and as a result of her having delivered 4,156 testimonies she left 690 books and 976 booklets, or a total of 1,666 pieces of literature, in the hands of 713 people. Before the branch office was opened in the Philippines one auxiliary sent us three reports showing a total of 7 books, 50 booklets, 12 hours, 50 testimonies, and 50 persons receiving the literature. Last winter two pioneers went down to Porto Rico and in 21 weeks’ time they placed 652 books and 914 booklets in the hands of 1,299 persons. In the 893 hours they gave to the work 4,801 testimonies were given. The sister working in Guatemala, before she went there, sent in seven reports from Salvador, where she also worked the previous year. During this time she placed 73 books, 155 booklets, in 206 hours; 1,189 testimonies were given, and 192 persons took the books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>FAITHFUL WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Faith, courage and love must be had by those who journey through the isolated parts of the earth preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God. These witnesses of Jehovah must believe in God and his kingdom and have a knowledge of his Word and purposes as therein expressed and then confidently rely upon him and his promises. That is faith. Many hardships are encountered as they pursue the work of giving the testimony. They come in contact with many people who are indifferent to the name and Word of God and many others who violently oppose; persecutions are heaped upon the pioneers by enemies of the truth, who are agents of Satan; they have not the opportunity to commune frequently with others of like precious faith; and all these things have a tendency to discourage those in the field work. When the pioneer confidently relies upon the Lord God, bravely and faithfully meets all these obstacles, and resolutely and with inward joy pushes forward regardless of all opposition, knowing that he is right and going in the right way, that is courage. In doing this he has an inherent joy of having the Lord’s favor. He does not engage in this work for selfish, material gain, because often he does not make his necessary expenses. He does not go about the country visiting the people and preaching to them to gain a reputation amongst men, because he makes himself of no reputation and has no reputation amongst those who rule the world. He is subjected to the false charges, made by Satan’s representatives, of being a peddler or hawker, and is frequently interrupted, stopped in his work, and dragged into court. What, then, holds these faithful workers in the field and impels them to go on day after day doing this work with no possible material gain? The answer is, it is an unselfish devotion to God and his kingdom, and that is love. Therefore, said the apostle, love is the principal thing. We must have faith and courage, and an unselfish devotion to the Lord and his cause must be the impelling motive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some who have made a covenant with God to do his will attend conventions of his people and occasionally listen closely to what is said, but never participate in the field work, leaving that for others to do. Thereby they miss many precious blessings. When the storms are lashing the earth, these sit contentedly and quietly and snugly by their fireplaces, supplied with ample food and raiment and fuel to keep them warm, and they are at ease. In that very storm some of the Lord’s “servant” class, the faithful pioneer witnesses, are fighting against the elements in order to reach the next house where a testimony may be given concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. The pioneer encounters many difficulties that are escaped by the one who sits by his fireside and is at ease. The pioneer has far less of material comforts, but he has and enjoys the riches which no man can take away from him and which none of the world can appreciate, and these riches are the certainty that he is bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the glory of Jehovah’s name. During the past year many have seen their privilege of engaging in the pioneer work, and have done so. At one place all the members of the company left their quiet homes, and their frequent meetings together, and went boldly into the field, and the Lord has greatly blessed their efforts. In the ears of these faithful witnesses the words of the King continue to sweetly sound: “ Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” These faithful witnesses of the Lord are not hawkers or peddlers or colporteurs. They are preachers of the gospel of the kingdom, doing so in obedience to God’s commandments and because they love him and his kingdom. They appreciate the truth that Christ Jesus the King has begun his reign to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name. They see the great amount of oppression and suffering upon the people, and they know that the kingdom of God will remove all these disabilities and sorrows. They love the King and his kingdom, and they delight to endure hardship as good soldiers and to surmount the difficulties and go on in the service of the King. The words of the great King are a great comfort to them, when he says to his faithful witnesses: “For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pioneers are asking no favors of man, but it will be and is a privilege of those who have a spare room in their homes or some extra food to take these faithful servants of the Lord in occasionally, and this some of them are doing. The servants of the King are not now looking for material comforts, nor would it be pleasing to the Lord for them to make demand upon their brethren for comforts of the material kind. They fully realize that the Lord knows what things they need and gives his word of promise that these things shall be supplied and that the faithful servants shall never be found begging for bread, nor shall they ever be forsaken by the Lord. Many of these faithful workers in the field have reported to this office experiences of how at times there has been nothing immediately in sight for them to eat, and yet when everything about seemed to be the hardest, they not knowing just which way to turn, the Lord has suddenly made all the necessary provisions. Jehovah takes care of his own. This is an evidence of the Lord’s constant care and protection, and it is a great comfort to those who faithfully serve him. Jehovah has promised it, and will do all that is necessary for his faithful servants. These faithful witnesses are going forth as ambassadors of the Lord, and to them he has said: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. ’ ’—Isa. 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let the pioneers be of good courage and continue to press the battle to the gate, always bearing in mind that the angel of the Lord encamps round about his faithful servants and delivers them from all oppression and opposition. Whether these faithful pioneers are in America, Europe, Asia or Africa, or in the islands of the sea, the great God of the universe is their shield and strength, and his mighty officers give the protection and consolation needed. No greater favor could be bestowed upon a creature on earth than that of suffering inconvenience and persecution for righteousness’ sake, that he might have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s great name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>COLORED WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">By this is meant those who are of the African race by nature but who are children of the great King engaged in the King’s service. Satan the enemy placed envy and prejudice in the hearts of men because of the fact that some are white and others are of color, and it is just as well that we take advantage of Satan’s wrong and great mistake and turn these things against him and to the good of others. The child of God does not look with greater favor on his white brother than upon his colored brother; but, seeing the prejudice of men, he appreciates the privilege of taking advantage of conditions to get the truth amongst the people in the best possible manner. That is the reason why the colored witnesses have been specially assigned to work amongst the colored people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year 73 of these faithful souls have engaged in the pioneer service, and 70 in the auxiliary service, preaching the gospel of the kingdom. They have encountered many hardships and much opposition, but have gone straight forward in their work. Their reports show that they have worked an aggregate of 114,283 hours, given testimonies to 432,508 persons, and placed in the hands of the people 41,393 bound books and 76,428 booklets, or a total of 117,821 copies, each containing the message of God’s kingdom. The colored people usually have large families, and a book in a family often serves a number of persons; and thus is seen the great amount of preaching that has been done by these faithful servants of Jehovah during the year. This going from house to house and preaching the gospel is far more effective than renting a hall and gathering together a few to talk to them It is the Lord’s way, and therefore the Lord has added his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The colored brethren in the United States have been working together in unity during the year, and have thus been bearing much fruit of the kingdom before that people. They have shown a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. There are 38 organized companies, in addition to the pioneers, who work regularly and who regularly make their reports to headquarters. Of these company workers 470 have engaged in the work during the year. These company workers have placed in the hands of the people 20,380 bound books and 65,699 booklets, or a total of 86,079 copies of the books and booklets. These companies have witnessed to 389,362 people and delivered into the hands of 106,928 persons the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses of the colored race by their combined efforts have engaged in an aggregate of 185,212 hours of field service during the year. They have placed a total of 203,900 books and booklets. These books and booklets have gone into 179,237 different homes. The total of testimonies delivered was 821,770. Never before has there been such an effective testimony of preaching the gospel amongst the colored people of America.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>LANGUAGES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">America is the most cosmopolitan portion of the earth; the reason being that it was at one time a sort of asylum or refuge for those who were ill-treated and persecuted in other lands, and who fled to America. While foreign immigration is now greatly restricted in America, still foreigners come to this country under the quota and settle in this land. In America there are a great number of persons speaking languages other than the English, and to them the testimony of God’s kingdom must be given in obedience to his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To meet the demand and opportunity of service the Brooklyn factory causes the message of the kingdom to be translated into different languages and the books to be manufactured in the Society’s factory at this point. During the fiscal year witnesses of Jehovah representing 33 different languages or nationalities have engaged in the service within the borders of the United States. Some of these witnesses do not speak the English language at all, but they carry with them cards upon which the testimony is printed in English so that they may witness to even the English-speaking persons when they come in contact with them. Others speaking foreign languages and also the English have devoted most of their time to preaching amongst the English-speaking people. Amongst these speaking languages other than the English 252 persons have engaged in preaching the gospel as pioneers, and 179 as auxiliary workers, and their combined efforts have resulted as follows: 290,036 hours in the field service; 1,234,431 testimonies given; literature placed in homes or with persons to the number of 233,683. They have placed in the hands of the people bound books to the number of 117,251, and booklets to the number of 350,027, making a total of 467,278 volumes of books and booklets. It would have been utterly impossible to do such a great amount of preaching the gospel by merely renting halls, advertising the meetings and inviting the people to come and hear some speaker. In addition to the foregoing the foreign-speaking brethren have broadcast the message of the kingdom by radio. The number of these broadcasts during the year in the United States is as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">In addition to these broadcasts in the United States, forty-three radio lectures have been broadcast in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Brooklyn factory during the year has printed and shipped out the message in 38 different languages, or 5 more than those represented by witnesses who are engaged in the field work. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in the United States includes these languages and must not be confused with the foreign work. We give the figures separately with reference to languages other than English, in order that it may be seen what work is being done amongst the foreign-speaking people in the United States. It should also be kept in mind that many foreigners who have resided some time in America readily read the English language, and many of these are served with the English literature. In order that the work done amongst the foreign-speaking people in the United States may be seen, the following digest of the work in the different languages is given:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The only magazine published that is devoted exclusively to Jehovah and his kingdom is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font9">Its purpose appears on the second page of each issue. It announces matters of particular interest with reference to the study of God’s Word or new publications. The leading article of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> in each issue is a discussion of some part of God’s Word. The effort is made to ascertain the will of God concerning his people as set forth in the Scriptures and to publish that. During the year </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> has been issued regularly and always on time. If there is a delay in going to the subscribers, the delay is not the fault of the publishers, but of the post that carries it to the people. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> also carries a list of radio stations that regularly broadcast the kingdom message. It gives the names of those whom the Society sends out as its special representatives to aid in the organization for the preaching of the gospel and which work is carried forward by the various companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The policy of the Society in carrying forward its work which the Lord has assigned to it is set forth in the columns of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font9"> or in instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">specially issued from the office. At times readers of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> are confused in a measure concerning the policy of the Society in doing certain work, which confusion results from individuals’ attempting to advise as to what the Society is or is not doing. Whenever any communication or advice is to be given to the Lord’s people in general throughout the land, it will appear in the columns of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> It is &lt;a safe rule to always say: I will not believe it until I see it in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> Confusion would be avoided by taking this course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is published in the English language at the Brooklyn office and is mailed to the English subscribers in various parts of the earth. In addition to the English language it is published at the Brooklyn office in the following other languages, to wit: Armenian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> publishes letters written by active servants of the Lord who write of matters concerning experiences that are considered helpful to others. There is no effort on the part of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> to give adulation or praise to any creature. It recognizes that it is its sacred duty and privilege to give all praise to Jehovah and his kingdom. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> is published in other languages in different countries and mailed from the respective places of publication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">For some years now the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine has been published, its purpose being to give general information that will be of interest and helpful to those who are seeking righteousness and to walk in the way of righteousness. Doctrinal matters are not discussed in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font9"> except it be in the publication of lectures delivered by radio or otherwise and which are then published in this magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time a special issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font9">is issued, carrying some particular lecture or article which is of peculiar interest to the people. The pioneers, auxiliaries and company workers in the field take subscriptions for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>LUZ ¥ VERDAD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fot the benefit of the Spanish-speaking people on the American continent the Society this year inaugu-Tated a new publication the title of which is, in 'Spanish, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad.</span><span class="font9"> In English this title means &quot;Light and Truth”. It is a 16-page magazine, issued once each month, and a year’s subscription is 75 cents. The first issue of this magazine contains the lecture ■“The Kingdom, the Hope of the World”. This magazine has carried the entire contents of the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World.</span><span class="font9"> Of this issue 550,000 copies have been published and distributed in South American countries. Each issue carries a radio lecture. It begins its appearance in the field with a healthy subscription which is constantly increasing. It is hoped that the Lord will bless this means of getting the truth to the Spanish-speaking people of South America in particular.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark186"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>MAIL</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">The Society does a large work by mail. Numerous persons write to the office daily, asking questions and inquiring for further information concerning God’s kingdom. The average receipt of such mail per day during the entire 270 working days of the year was, to wit, 1,343 letters and cards. These must be opened, carefully read, marked, answered and filed. The incoming mail during the year totaled 365,468 pieces. This has been a very large increase of mail received during the year. Doubtless the radio has been the chief reason for this increase. Persons hearing the radio lectures write to the Society’s office for further information. The mail dispatched during the year totals 300,170.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark188"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>FOREIGN REPORTS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">The nations of the earth constitute the field for the witness work of the kingdom. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the message must be carried in every language by Jehovah’s witnesses to every subdivision of the population of the earth. The nation of Israel first heard the gospel, and the people in and about Israel also came in contact with and heard the message. This particularly corresponds to “Christendom” and the nations in and about the land that is called “Christendom”. In order to systematically arrange the witness work throughout the field, the Society, by the grace of the Lord, has subdivided the field somewhat according to national boundaries. In many of these countries the Society maintains branch offices. A summary of the activities as reported by those respective offices at the end of the fiscal year appears hereinafter. Each one of these branch offices makes a regular monthly report to the president, and at the end of the year a general report is also submitted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark190"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>AFRICA (South and East)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">For some years the South African branch office has been maintained at Cape Town, in a British province of South Africa, and which office has had immediate charge of the work in that part of the earth. During the year just past the workers there have extended their activities into wider fields, into the dark portions of South Africa and East Africa. It is gratifying to note the increase in the work in that part of the earth over anything previous. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much good work in the interest of Jehovah’s kingdom has been accomplished m this part of the field during the past year. Jehovah’s witnesses, although few in number, have been seeking to prove worthy of their new name, and our efforts to magnify the name of the Lord have been marked by many evidences of his blessing and approval. As the figures submitted herewith show, a greater effort has been made this year to give the witness than in any previous year. Although we know results are not our responsibility, we are nevertheless greatly encouraged to note that the Lord has again given a very considerable increase in this respect also. Our average number of weekly workers has gone up from 73 to 92; there has been an increase of 33} percent in the time spent in the field; an increase of 60 percent in the number of testimonies given; an increase of 59 percent in the amount of literature placed in the house-to-house work, and a total increase of 70 percent in the number of books distributed from the office, over the 1931 figures. This has been accomplished during a year marked by probably the greatest depression that this country has yet known. Many farmers, who a few years ago were comparatively prosperous, are now bankrupt, and those who have managed to escape that fate are dependent upon government subsidies to keep going. Such subsidies are raised by taxation, and we, in common with other importers, are now obliged to pay 12} percent duty on all incoming shipments. Big business has been reducing staffs, cutting down wages, and generally ‘grinding the faces of the poor’. The ranks of the unemployed continue to increase, and the authorities have found it necessary to open soup kitchens in the towns to help alleviate the prevailing distress. Notwithstanding such conditions, and also that much time was devoted exclusively to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet campaign, we have just about held our own in the bound-book placements, and there has been a very large increase in the number of booklets distributed. Our figures for the year follow:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">During the year there have been quite a few outstanding features in our kingdom activities, and reference is made briefly to some of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">RADIO: Early in the year negotiations with the African Broadcasting Company led to a contract’s being made whereby this company undertook to put over electrical transcriptions of Brother Rutherford’s lectures once a month from their three main stations at Capetown, Johannesburg and Durban. The lectures have been heard in most parts of the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia and even as far north as Northern Rhodesia, 2,000 miles up the African continent. Hypocritical clergymen have gone sneaking to the broadcasting company and have done everything in their power to induce the company to cut us out, but thus far they have not succeeded. They are now telling their flocks not to listen, but the message is getting through the prison walls just the same. The lectures have been greatly enjoyed by the friends and the public. Reference to the former and to the motive and purpose of our work in calling at the homes of the people has greatly enthused us and at the same time has prepared the way for the leaving of many a book with truth-hungry people of good will Workers report also that where formerly prejudice made placements impossible, the literature is now eagerly taken as a result of listening in to the Watchtower broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">KINGDOM</span><span class="font8"> BOOKLET CAMPAIGN: There never was a campaign like this one! Our first, supplies were altogether inadequate, and we found it necessary to order twice as many again by cable from Brooklyn. The friends entered into the fray with enthusiasm. Instructions from head office were carried out to the letter. The rulers, from the governor-general and cabinet ministers downward, were served personally, and many interesting experiences were had in so doing. The politicians and financiers, in most instances, received the message of warning quite graciously, but not so the Haman crowd. The majority of that bunch fulminated violently, and there were repercussions in more than one church magazine. The people of good will received the message gladly, and quite a number wrote to the office for additional copies to pass on to their friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">VINDICATION</span><span class="font8"> BOOK ONE: While we were still busy with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets, our supplies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Book One came to hand. One or two were a little timorous at first about giving this book to those who had not previously read some of the other books, but once their responsibility was fully appreciated, their fears soon vanished, and it gives real pleasure to report that this book has had a greater distribution in the nine months we have had it than any of the other's in English in the twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SPECIAL WEEK CAMPAIGNS: These are now firmly established as an integral part of the general campaign. The majority of the workers really do make a special effort. Those living in the isolated places endeavor to have a share with those in the more thickly populated districts, with the result that the number of workers taking part on each occasion was well over the average number of weekly workers. Some of the pioneers get in 60 hours in these efforts; several of the auxiliaries have reached 38 hours; while the Capetown company has averaged as much as 20.7 hours per worker, and some of the smaller companies considerably more. The enthusiasm of the workers reached a peak during International Thanksgiving Testimony Period, when Jehovah’s witnesses turned out practically 100 percent strong. And yet the total m action was only 60 percent of the number of Europeans who partook of the Memorial emblems. We earnestly hope that the ‘ ‘ Memorial saints” will awake from their lethargy before it is too late. Our figures for these special weeks are given below:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">PIONEERS: The weekly average of pioneers has gone up from 11 to 15. The pioneers have averaged 23 hours per week per worker during the year. In addition to that time, which has been spent in actual witnessing, much time was taken up in traveling, as great distances have frequently to be covered in such a land as this. If allowance were made for that, the figure would be at least 30 hours per week. While most of the witness work has been, done in South Africa, we have -again carried the message farther afield. A .second trip was made to East Africa, and on this occasion Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Kenya and Uganda were worked. In all, 7,000 books and booklets were placed in that part of the country in the two trips, and 35 subscriptions obtained for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> Considerable interest was aroused, particularly amongst the Goanese. The witness has also been given to Europeans in Northern and in Southern Rhodesia, in the former colony for the first time. The enemy tried to prevent the message from being spread in these countries, both of which are closely associated with the seventh world power. An order of deportation was issued to the four pioneers, who were sent there, a week after they arrived. The authorities considered that “the doctrines they intended to propagate were dangerpus, particularly to the native mind”. Following an appeal to the colonial secretary the deportation order was canceled and permission given to stay. This, however, is now the third successful campaign that has been conducted in Southern Rhodesia, and while there are still some obstacles to be overcome with respect to the native work, we confidently anticipate that all barriers will shortly be removed and that the truth will have free access to all, and in particular to those who have been deceived and robbed by the missionaries. There are some honest hearts below black skins, and a very considerable number of these people know very much more about the Lord’s message and real Christianity than those who have professed to teach it to them but who in reality have fed them on doctrines of devils. It is not without significance that it was in that selfsame part of the domains of the seventh world power that our youngest pioneer, aged 18, was sent to prison for four days for preaching the gospel of Jehovah God’s kingdom, on the false charge that he was “hawking without a license”. The magistrate who sentenced him was a Roman Catholic, and he had a Roman Catholic priest staying with him as his guest at the time. A personal testimony and copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> have been given to almost all the rulers in these two countries. The warning notice has been served, and “they shall know that I am Jehovah”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">COMPANIES: It gives pleasure to report that a more consistent effort has been put forth by the company workers. The weekly average of those reporting has gone up from 53 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">70, and they have averaged </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font8"> hours per week. The total number of permit holders in the companies is 90. Making due allowance for brethren living on farms, we feel there is still plenty of room for improvement, and we hope that some who up to the present have engaged in the work only spasmodically will realize the need for regular effort and appreciate more fully that the kingdom interests are worthy of the first place in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SERVICE CONVENTIONS: Service conventions were arranged at Capetown and Johannesburg. These proved to be a stimulus to those attending. In addition service visits were made by several brethren representing the office to the companies and isolated brethren who have requested such visits. In all, 109 service meetings were held, with an attendance of 2,597. There were also 22 public meetings, several of which were in East Africa. Good interest was manifested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NEW PUBLICATIONS: On instruction received from head office, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Book One and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> were translated into Afrikaans. The latter has already been spread througli-out the country, find we hope to have supplies of the former shortly. The author’s editions of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Books Two and Three have just been received. We are indeed grateful to the Lord for this further provision of food convenient. The reading has brought much joy to our hearts. The clearer understanding of the Jehu work and the Temple chapters are an incentive to increased zeal and boldness in declaring the kingdom message. Surely all will now appreciate that the Lord’s work is not something of secondary importance, to be treated carelessly or with indifference after our own selfish interests have been served, but something that demands our very best and nothing less than absolute devotion to the Lord and his cause. Thoroughness in giving the witness, and careful attention to detail, and in particular those detailed instructions which come from time to time from headquarters, appear to be absolute essentials for all those who would have the Lord’s continued approval. The explanation of Gog in the land of Magog serves as an added warning and impresses the need for the remnant servant to dwell in the secret place of the Most High. Evidences of Gog’s activities in this land are not wanting, and we therefore rejoice in the prospect of a detailed explanation of the prophecies relating to the subject of &quot;Preservation”. The paper &quot;Order of Trial” has come just on time, and will help us to give a good testimony against the rulers of Satan’s world before they are blotted out. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lord is making a truly wonderful provision for all our needs. We also welcome the announcement of a complete set of new booklets, and look forward to having a share in their distribution in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This report would be incomplete without an expression of our gratitude to the Lord for all the help and encouragement we receive so regularly through the columns of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font8"> The South African company of Jehovah’s witnesses send you their love and pray that you may be given grace, strength and wisdom in every effort made to advance the kingdom interests on earth. We continue to appreciate the faithful lead from headquarters, and assure you of our firm determination to “follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth’’ and until the great name of Jehovah has been completely vindicated before all creation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark192"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the past year the Lord has prospered the work in West Africa. A number of public meetings have been held which were well attended, and the people of West Africa are showing an increased interest in the message of the kingdom. Heretofore most of the literature distributed in West Africa has been in the English language; but as a large number of the natives do not read or understand English, arrangements have been made to have some of the Society’s publications printed in Yoruba, which is their native tongue. During the year the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font9">booklet was set up in Yoruba, and a shipment made the latter part of the year. Within a short time we expect to have several books and booklets printed in Yoruba. The natives are eager to get the kingdom message in their own language, and the printing of the Society’s publications in Yoruba will open up a large new field for Jehovah’s witnesses in that land. There are now more than 80 witnesses singing forth Jehovah’s praises in West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At this time the final report has not been received from the branch manager, but we are advised that a total of 14,867 books and 21,568 booklets were distributed from the West African branch during the year. This makes a grand total of 36,435 books and booklets, which is a large increase over the previous year. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet especially received a large circulation, of which more than 10,000 were distributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>AMERICA, SOUTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the year the Society sent a special representative throughout the various countries of South America. A wide field was covered in this witness work by means of radio as well as by the distribution of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet issued in magazine form. A summary of the work in these countries of South America will appear under different subheads where the Society maintains a local representative.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Society’s special representative visited Buenos Aires, of the Argentine Republic, and used the radio stations there for several public lectures with splendid results, and since then there has been a noted increase in the distribution of literature in that country. The Spanish-speaking people of the south do not move with rapidity, but we are glad to note an increase in the work in the Argentine Republic during the year. The total number of bound books put out was 2,574; booklets other than </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom,</span><span class="font9"> 31,133; booklets in magazine form containing “The Kingdom, the Hope of the World”, 200,000; making a total of 233,707.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark198"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Society’s office at Strathfield, N. S. W., has immediate direction of the work in Australia, New Zealand and the South Sea Islands. The radio has been used in that part of the earth to splendid advantage in mailing known the message of the kingdom. The enemies of the truth made a desperate attempt to prevent the radio from broadcasting the truth there, as well as in other parts of the earth. We are happy to report, however, that at this time there are twenty, radio stations regularly sending forth the message of the kingdom. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">BADIO: The radio in this country had a small beginning, but as one station after another began to be added to the weekly broadcast others seemingly felt they were left out and voluntarily expressed their desire to have the privilege of broadcasting Judge Butherford’s lectures. Some who stopped broadcasting for a while, because of opposition, resumed later on when they saw that their course of action was foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses in this section of the earth have manifested the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. They have pushed forward in doing with their might what their hands have found to do, and the result shows a healthy increase all along the line, as will be seen by a careful examination of the figures hereto attached. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah has protected and directed his people during another year of praise and service in the vindication of his Word and name. It is a privilege indeed to report the activities of the year on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses who have participated in the Australasian Branch activities during the year just ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A decided increase is noticeable in every branch of activity. Many more workers expressed their desire and actually participated in witnessing during the year. At the suggestion of the head office a convention was held at Sydney during March, 1932, which resulted in a great stimulus to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PIONEEB SEBVICE: The increased light sent forth by Jehovah through </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and other publications of the Society induced many to enter this branch of service during the year, so that now we have the greatest number that we have ever had regularly singing forth the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">GBOUPING PIONEEBS: During the past year we have tried out an arrangement in connection with pioneers, of grouping them in the cities and also in the country. The result has been very satisfactory. The arrangement is as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the. cities groups are located at convenient centers, as many as ten pioneers being housed together and properly equipped with cars and bicycles so as to be able to get to their territory quickly. The groups traveling around the country-side are similarly organized and equipped with sufficient cars or caravans and cycles. The result has been very gratifying. The brethren get through the country in the &quot;locust” fashion, and in many cases towns and sections are done before the clergy, who are always ready to oppose, wake up and start their opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much has been done in the way of witnessing in the street and at church doors; in fact, almost everyone met by Jehovah’s witnesses, no matter where he is or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font8"> what time, is witnessed to. Some have started even as early as five o’clock in the morning and placed books. Others have engaged in the street work .while people have been on their way to church mass, and in every case the results have been very successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PURCHASING EQUIPMENT: The purchasing of equipment for the pioneers, such as bicycles and cars, has been done ■under the supervision of the Society at the best possible prices obtainable. The pioneers appreciate this service very much because of the fact that they are able not only to get the best material, but to get it at the proper price. In some cases brethren who have some means but are not able to get full tune in the service themselves, have placed some money at the disposal of the pioneer service department for the purpose of creating a pool for procuring bicycles and other equipment for the friends. This has meant that in some cases pioneeis without the means have been able to get bicycles for which they can pay at the rate of a small amount per week, winch, in turn, goes back into the fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brethren of mechanical ability have volunteered their services to these various groups to keep the ears in repair. This is arranged under the supervision of the office, and much money that is frequently wasted on car repairs at garages is saved and a more efficient service rendered, resulting in the pioneers ’ getting more time in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SOUTH SEA ISLANDS: The work has been continued in these islands during the year, and fresh fields have been opened up in Tahiti; and during the latter part of the year the head office assigned the Malay States to this branch. Immediately the J. w. flag was hoisted there, and the witness work continues. The work amongst the people in the islands can be speeded on considerably by having boats to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font8"> around from one place to the other. It is hoped that during the coming year facilities along this line will be provided by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">FOREIGN SPEAKING: The work amongst the foreigners has grown in volume during the year, and we are pleased to report that we have two pioneers who speak the Italian language working regularly amongst their nationality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">At Bern, Switzerland, the Society maintains a factory for the publication of books and magazines carrying the kingdom message; also a general office the duties of which are to have supervision over the work in the countries of Austria, Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Poland, Rumania, Sarre Basin, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The manager of this office makes regular reports to the main office at Brooklyn. A general report from the Central European office is here inserted and the detail reports of the various countries above named will appear at the regular place hereinafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The local manager reports that at the beginning of the year that office set a quota of 1,500,000 books and booklets to be placed in the hands of the people within that territory during the fiscal year. This was considerably above what was actually done the previous year. When the totals were tabulated at the end of the fiscal year, it was found that within this territory the workers had been in the field 535,906 hours and had placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 2,449,808. The constant and healthy increase of the work within this territory since 1928 is indicated by the table below, and is therefore very gratifying:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The enemy did everything within his power to hinder this work; but the Lord held back the enemy's forces, and the work of witnessing to the truth went grandly on. From the manager’s report of the Central European office the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The headquarters of the Lord’s organization had set aside five special weeks of the fifty-two weeks of the year, and every one of these periods was observed by the brethren with greatest enthusiasm, as shown by the results. In the five weeks 24 percent of the entire result of the year was accomplished. Among the five special campaigns, as in all countries so with us, the Kingdom Week was the greatest. The brethren put forth their best efforts and spent more time than ever in the service. Everyone wished to have a part in warning the rulers, and so no one was overlooked with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. Each one of the “great” leaders of the nations, gathered in Geneva at the Disarmament Conference, received a copy in his respective language with a brief card of introduction, in which he was requested to give his attention to the message. Of the “mighty” ones of earth 292 were thus reached, and only one refused the booklet. In our territory, all together, 25,891 “rulers” were served notice. Surely the Lord’s judgments are now reaching the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A special event during the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font8">gdom Week, from January 31 to February 7, was our action with two aeroplanes in the capital of Switzerland and also in three other cities of this land. It was an interesting sight. The first aeroplane scattered leaflets over the cities, and the second carried a large banner with the inscription “The Last Hope”. Then brothers walked through the streets as sandwich men with posters. Forty workers stood on street corners and called out the message to the people, and three cars rode through the city with original advertising matter. The following Sunday, when the brethren visited the people with the booklets, they were all informed regarding the action in the capital, and the booklets could be placed quickly. At Bern alone within three hours the forty brethren placed 2,000 booklets on the street, and during this special week 2,266 workers placed, during 25,609 hours, 2,108 books and 152,892 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Within the foregoing territory there are 241 pioneers and 75 auxiliaries regularly in the service. The increase in the hours worked and work done during the year is as follows: Increase in hours, 114; increase in distribution of books, 27 percent; increase in distribution of booklets, 132 percent. About half of this work was accomplished by pioneers, and the rest by auxiharies and company workers. This shows that approximately a million more booklets were placed in this territory during the year than in the previous year. The following table showing the detailed work of the Central European office will be of interest:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the fiscal year the Society’s factory at Bern, Switzerland, manufactured 240,137 books, 3,180,870 booklets, 697,026 magazines, 1,124,875 bulletins, making a grand total of 5,242,908 pieces of literature. Other books and booklets and magazines were published by factories operated in Rumania, Yugoslavia and Poland. A great amount of paper, cardboard, glue, cloth, ribbon, thread and other materials were necessarily consumed in the manufacture of the literature above described. This factory at Bern, Switzerland, produced literature during the year in 18 different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In addition thereto, a large correspondence is carried on in this work. During the year mail received totaled 13,717 pieces; and dispatched, 11,754 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under the jurisdiction of this office the message of the kingdom has been broadcast by radio. In France four radio stations were regularly used to broadcast the transcriptions and other messages of the truth. These radio stations cover the countries of France and Belgium, as well as portions of Germany and Switzerland, and a good part of England.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark208"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">At Copenhagen, Denmark, the Society maintains a general office designated as the Northern European office and which exercises supervisory control over the Society’s work in the countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Esthonia, Lithuania and Latvia. There has been a healthy growth and increased manifestation of zeal on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses during the fiscal year just closed. The total output of literature within this territory during the year was 1,046,194 books and booklets. From the report filed by the local manager of the Northern European office the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Early in. the year just ended appeared a letter in the Norwegian Bulletin which ran thus: ‘<sup>1</sup> There has come a song into my life such as was never there before, and I believe it is because of the new name Jehovah has given us, Jehovah’s witnesses. May He ever give me to hold fast that name, because it implies, of course, that I must really go forth as His witness. ” The new name not only has wonderfully strengthened and encouraged the remnant who, to the number of 859, were out each week on average in 1930-31, but has emboldened others to take the field, so that last year our numbers were increased by 20 percent, to 1,030 who were in the field each week. This increase in our numbers, coupled with the greater distress now obtaining everywhere, has, with Jehovah’s blessing, given us the best year we have yet enjoyed in Northern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No less than 1,652,025 testimonies were given that Jehovah is God and that the time for his promised righteous government has come. It must, indeed, be sweet music in his ears as he listens to the remnant, as one man, proclaiming: “Centuries ago Jehovah promised that He would provide the people on earth with a righteous government in His due time. That due time has now come, and as one of Jehovah’s witnesses I am here to give you the information.” From the office were sent out 124,735 books, 329,796 ordinary and 719,136 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font8">booklets, while a grand total of 1,046,194 were actually placed, viz., 110,943 books, 331,448 ordinary and 603,803 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font8">booklets. Only once has that number been exceeded, in 1927-28, when we had 1,108,795; but that included only 98,077 books, as against 110,943 on this occasion, so that 1931-32 is thus our high-water mark in witnessing, and that in spite of the fact that our usually excellent autumn period will, this year, figure in the opening month of 1932-33 instead of the closing one of 1931-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This year 185 pioneers and auxiliaries spread 460,705, as against 291,210, by 151, last year. It is very encouraging to see more and more of the brethren who are unemeumbered going forth into the field and giving all their time. Some find a difficulty in putting in the requisite number of hours, but the exhortations and instructions sent on in the Bulletins are bearing fruit. The Bulletins here closely follow the American one, with adjustments for local conditions. In this way the Lord’s army here is directed from headquarters, as it is all over the earth, and the brethren are realizing this more and more. It is becoming easier and easier to read upon the foreheads of those devoted to Jehovah the name, Jehovah’s witnesses. They stand out as a people apart from all others. Those who do not rightly belong are gradually being removed. In Norway, Esthonia and Lithuania the presence of foreign pioneers is being felt, and we are very glad of the help thus given ns from other fields. It emphasizes the unity of the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SPECIAL PERIODS: These periods set apart by the Society for special efforts were much enjoyed. That an effort •is world-wide seems to enable the brethren to put forth their best endeavors. In November Testimony Week 1,462 took part, gave 61,021 testimonies, and spread 38,736, including 6,101 bound books. In the Bound-Book Testimony Period in January 1,571 were out, gave 55,507 testimonies, and placed 11,556 books as well as 25,599 other pieces of literature. One sister in Sweden placed 172 bound books, while a brother in Norway placed no less than 245, including 80 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font8"> In the Thanksgiving Period 107,996 testimonies were given by 1,554 brethren, and 92,463 books and booklets spread, mostly </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom;</span><span class="font8"> while in the 18,000-Hour Period, in July, 1,255 placed 44,411 pieces, and gave 63,295 testimonies. In the brief September vacation period 1,097 were out, placed 17,152, and gave 28,211 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have greatly appreciated the constant stream of new books and booklets, as they give a great fillip to the witness. Now we have nine bound books to offer in Finland, and eight in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while their ninth is about ready. Then, in all four lands, the tenth is being printed, while the eleventh and twelfth are being translated, as well as the beautiful new booklets. It entails a lot of work to get the diction of the original well reproduced in other languages, but the brethren ‘<sup>1</sup> stretch every nerve, and press with vigor on”, not, as we used to sing, ‘because a heavenly race demands our zeal, and an immortal crown,’ but because they realize that Jehovah’s name must be vindicated. Truly Jehovah does not send us to fight at our own charges, but gives us weapons for the fray and puts his Word in our mouths. We are very glad, too, that from October 1 you have made it possible to place the books for a much lower contribution. The goodness of Jehovah to his remnant at this time is wonderful. All who are not blind can see that we are his witnesses and not mere booksellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">BETHEL STUDIES: These are held regularly and have been much blessed to all participating, and especially to the brothers who, when they go out to the companies, are better prepared to take studies or give talks. There, too, we see clearly the Lord’s leading and blessing. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> is a veritable gold mine; and as prophecy upon prophecy is opened up we we conscious the .Lord has made </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font8">to sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. With the psalmist we exclaim: “ Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits!” Now we see the valley of dry bones stand upon their feet, “an exceeding great army,” and we do indeed rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">RADIO: From Tallinn the message continues to go forth regularly for one hour each Sunday, viz., 15 minutes each for Bsthonian, Russian, Finnish and Swedish, from 17: 30 to 18: 30 (English 'time 15: 30 to 16:30). It helps the work, particularly in Esthoma and Finland, and we were delighted when the Communist part of the Devil’s organization wailed a warning against us from Moscow because we were “anti-revolutionary”. The clergy are very strongly entrenched on all the radio boards; but their influence is on the wane, so we are to attack again. Recently a brother placed some literature because he said we were refused permission to broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">THE GOLDEN AGE:</span><span class="font8"> This year we have increased from 46,900 to 47,800; and if single copies are included, it means that in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland we have an edition of 60,000 which goes out each month, regularly, helping to break down prejudice and spread the books</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From time to time I have given your messages of love and encouragement to the brethren here, and now I have to send many greetings of warm love back to you again. We thank the Lord upon every remembrance of you, and pray his continued blessing upon all your work and labor of love for him and for the glory of his name and the good of his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark210"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Among the benighted countries of this earth in the realm of “Christendom” is the Catholic country of Austria. The poor people have been kept in darkness for a long while; but in recent years the Lord has opened the eyes of some, and now the work of his witnesses is increasing and many more are coming to know that Jehovah is God. Only about a deeade ago vicious mobs, incited by the papal system, attempted to kill one speaking for the truth. Since that time many persons have been arrested at the instance of ■Catholic priests; but now even publie officials are seeing the hypocrisy of those who claim to serve God but ■who, in fact, are serving God’s enemy. The following facts are gleaned from the local manager’s report, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was an increase in the distribution of books and booklets in 1932 over that of 1931, to the number of 62,723. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people, and which carried the message of the kingdom during the year 1932, was 224,038. That is a net increase of practically 40 percent over the previous year. In addition thereto, 13,321 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> were placed in the hands of the people, and 40,000 tracts were freely distributed. The increase of the work during the year has been due, of course, to the Lord’s blessing, and all those participating in the work in that part of the field as well as those elsewhere rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are thirty companies in Austria, organized and learning the Lord’s truth. There are 22 pioneers and 23 auxiliaries in the field service work; the remaining work is done by the service workers in the companies. The local manager reports that the people of Austria are beginning to see the hypocrisy of the clergy, and those who a few years ago opposed the truth are now eagerly seeking to know concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. Everywhere where there are any arrests or other interferences with the Lord’s workers, this is due to the influence of the priests of the Catholic system. The Catholics themselves are beco</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font8">g alarmed at the falling away of the people. A Catholic journal in Austria editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The radio is being used by the enemies of the Catholic church. Films are shown; printing houses are established, where literature in all languages is printed, and the Catholic cause is not in as good a way as many Catholics may think. Ghastly things are awaiting the Catholic church. Yea, the battle of the enemies of the Catholic church is getting more terrible. It seems as though hell is let loose on earth.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That paper is beginning to “see things”, evidently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark212"></a><span class="font9">Belgium is a small country, and its people have been priest-ridden for years. There are many people of good will there, however, and amongst them the truth is appreciated. The local representative of the Society, in his report to the president’s office, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Belgium, with its 7,000,000 inhabitants, has received an extended witness, and everywhere -attention is now drawn, to Je<sup>; </sup>hovah’s witnesses. The workers have shown, a great appreciation for the new name which Jehovah has given us, and they have worked faithfully to the honor of the Lord. The number of workers during the year has increased. There are 22 pioneers in the field, 23 regular and 13 occasional company workers, and 5 auxiliaries. The pioneers placed 172,808 books and booklets with the people, while the company workers placed 844 books and 19,540 booklets, 2,650 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font8">and 114 Bibles; which is a decided increase over last year. The total amount of literature distributed in Belgium during the year: 196,520 books and booklets, to compare with 74,609 for the previous year. During the year a service convention was held in Brussels, which greatly encouraged and comforted those who engaged in the Lord’s service. As an illustration of how the work progresses: A policeman made one pioneer leave the village, and the very next day this pioneer’s companion, working in the same town, placed in the hands of that identical policeman 3 Bibles and 9 books. His change of heart came quickly. It is quite manifest that the Catholic priests are losing their influence amongst the people. The common people are hearing the truth gladly. The radio stations in France reach into Belgium and are doing good service there. The Belgian servants of the Lord are few in number but strong in faith, rejoicing in the opportunity of giving witness to Jehovah’s name and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>BLIND BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Society maintains at Logansport, Indiana, an office from which those interested in the truth but having no natural sight are served. The following excerpt is taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I find that there is a very small number of the blind who have anyone in their homes who will read to them. If the printed page is not placed in their hands they have no chance to hear the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During November and December, 1931, and January, 1932, several notices of books for the blind were run in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font8"> This seemed to cause the workers to be on the lookout for the blind, as it was during this time that most of the requests for literature came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past year we have loaned The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> to 18 readers, 12 of whom are still on our list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beginning with September 1 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> we are publishing the new booklets as supplements, placing one chapter m each issue. We began with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Who is God!</span><span class="font8"> and are making seven supplements of the booklet. We have not been doing this long enough to know how it is being received. We are keeping the plates, so that the booklets may be published in book form if there is a call for them.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font9">Brazil has been in great trouble during the year. In addition to the times of depression, civil war or revolution has been on for nearly three months. This made it almost impossible to carry on any witness work; yet the separate companies in different parts did the best they could. No outside communication was had between Brazil and other points until the first of October. This trouble in the country makes it impossible to give a full report from every part. There are 51 company workers in Brazil and during the year these have been putting forth their best endeavors to get out the testimony. The result thus far reported is 6,732 books and booklets. The prospects are brighter for the future; and if the civil war does not arise again, the opportunities for spreading the message of the kingdom no doubt will be much better.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark223"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark224"></a>For many years the Lord has caused the message of the kingdom to be preached in Great Britain. There are no people under the sun who have a knowledge of the text of the Scriptures equal to that of the British people; but amongst those who know the text, however, there is a small number who really know the meaning thereof and appreciate it. The British clergy merely fill a nook in the political organization assigned to them, and they do their ‘duty’ in carrying out the obligations laid upon them by their god. In the land of Britain, however, there are a few faithful, earnest, zealous followers of Christ Jesus who are devoted to the kingdom of Jehovah. These put forth their best endeavors to make the message of the kingdom known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although there has been great suffering amongst the people because of economic conditions and greater difficulty on the part of the poor to provide the things needful for their bodies, yet there has been a decided increase in the work in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By &quot;British”, as herein used, are meant the countries of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which are under the immediate jurisdiction of the Society’s office in London. Reporting on the kingdom work, the local manager at London says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is with gratitude to Jehovah and with very much pleasure that I again send you the report of the work of Jehovah by his people in the British field during the last twelve months, from October to September. The report shows an increase in the work, and that is the first thing to tell. Despite the fact that conditions have remained hard and even difficult, the number of pieces of literature telling of the coming of the kingdom, but chiefly witnessing to the honor of Jehovah’s name, is very considerably increased. From the reports which are sent to you, you will have seen that the average of last year’s work has been maintained by the brethren; but now that it is tabulated it is seen clearly that the Lord has blessed his people with his zeal, and that they have used it to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total output of books and booklets is 2,113,024, an increase of 883,491. Of these, 462,716 are bound books and 1,650,308 are booklets. Each phase of the service shows activity, and work which can be done only by those who have the love of God shed abroad in their hearts and lives devoted to the service of Jehovah. The reports of the service work, the pioneer and auxiliary work, and the other work follow herewith. Total testimonies, 7,793,839.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are 376 companies enrolled for service, and of these an average of 346 have been engaged monthly. The number holding permits is 5,137, with an average of 3,079 workers reporting weekly. The brethren engaged m this service have placed during the year 1,185,577 volumes. Of these, 158,184 are bound books and 1,027,393 are booklets. The number of workers engaged is slightly advanced on last year, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">total output is 569,091 in advance on last year. The bound books are less in number, but that was chiefly because a special effort was made to place the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. The number of hours in which this work has been done by the brethren is 523,716, or 72,000 hours’ increase over last year; <sup>an</sup>d 5,272,483 testimonies have been given, an average of 33 testimonies weekly per worker. The brethren have had great joy in this work, as is evidenced from the reports which continually come in. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet, the Lord’s message to the rulers and the clergy and those who have been Satan’s agents in keeping the truth from the people, was a special means of blessing to all the workers. We have, however, to report that as yet only 60 percent of the permit holders engage in the work weekly. This figure is 5 percent increase on last year, which is a move in the right direction; but it seems certain that the rema</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">inin</span><span class="font8">g 40 percent could do something week by week. There is still a small number of companies who believe themselves to be in fullest harmony with the work but who have not organized themselves for service. The number is less than a dozen. It is regrettable that these do not place themselves in line with their brethren throughout the earth and organize themselves under the direction of the Society that they may the better serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Service Directors</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Five brethren have been engaged in this service during the year. They have made 692 visits to the companies and have held 1,348 meetings. Besides sharing with the brethren in this work of encouraging them, they have themselves placed 12,461 pieces of literature. The total of attendance on the drives which have been led by the regional service directors is 9,657. In this work they have spent 3,504 hours, giving 28,470 testimonies, and have traveled 26,510 </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font8">es in their work. That this service is very profitable to the companies is shown by the reports of encouragement received from time to time. The brethren themselves enjoy the work, and it surely has the Lord’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer and Auxiliary Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These two services have been represented during the past year by 247 pioneers and 133 auxiliaries. The average number at work during the year has, however, been only 216 pioneers and 118 auxiliaries. They have done good work in placing the literature and thereby representing our God, whose name</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">98 </span><span class="font8">they wish to honor in their service. They have been divided in the three countries as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In England, 200 pioneers, 102 auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Scotland, 22 pioneers, 29 auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ireland, 25 pioneers, 2 auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total output of pieces of literature numbers 733,358. The pioneers have placed 168,273 bound books and 413,406 booklets. This is a slight decrease in bound books, but there, is a large increase in the placement of booklets. The same applies in the ease of the auxiliaries; here is a decrease in the number of bound books, but a very considerable increase in booklets. The net result of the past year, compared with the previous year, shows an increase in these services of 289,480 pieces of literature placed in the hands of the people. The hours registered have averaged 24 hours weekly by the pioneers and 11 hours weekly by the auxiliaries. The total number of testimonies given to the honor of Jehovah in this work is 1,851,909 by the pioneers and 669,447 by the auxiliaries, or, all together, 2,403,472 testimonies to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There have been 29 service conventions held during the year, and, as always, these have proved times of refreshing and fellowship in the work of the Lord, and the Lord’s manifested blessing has been upon these gatherings. The number in attendance at the conventions has not been quite so large as last year, but as represented by the number of pieces of literature placed there has been an increase in activity; for, whereas last year the number of pieces of literature placed at conventions was 20,884, this year the number reported is 33,975. It is apparent at every convention that the brethren who gather do so for service for the Lord, and not merely to have a good time of pleasurable fellowship with each other or to discuss matters which were not of immediate importance. The brethren come like members of an army gathering to roll call: they come harnessed for service. Consequently it is reported consistently that the conventions have been times of refreshment and strengthening, and of an encouragement to continue in the woik which the Lord has given to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During this year we have not had the pleasure of your presence with us, and there has been no general convention. The power and strength of the Columbus convention continued to reach to us, for it was only in the earlier part of the year that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">we were able to put out the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kvnffdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. The knowledge that this was a special message from the Lord seemed to keep Columbus and all that it meant in </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font8">d, find that has in soma measure given the strength and encouragement that would come from a personal visit. The brethren look forward to the time when, in the Lord’s providence, .it may be possible for you to come again to this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing report of work dope under conditions which often entail much sacrifice of personal convenience shows that it is done for love and not of । constraint. It demonstrates that Jehovah has fulfilled his word, and has gathered a people for his name, for there is the constant realization that the Lord has his people throughout the earth doing the same work of seeking to fulfil his will and with a consciousness that they are working according theieto, and that they are by the grace of God fulfilling the word of God which declared this witness should be given at the time when the earth was in its distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The continual visits of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> are felt not only to be the blessing of the Lord in giving light and food to his people, but also to bring that oneness which otherwise would surely be difficult to realize. It can very truly be said that there has never been amongst the brethren in Britain and Ireland the feeling of oneness in the service of the Lord and of unity with their brethren throughout the earth as at the present time. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> is looked for eagerly, and its constant refreshers are surely blessed to the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The condition of these countries continues much the same as when the report was sent last year. It is true that the people in this countiy received a great jolt last year when British money and securities dropped in value in relation to other countries. But the internal condition, and therefore the general situation, remains about the same. The basic industries have no life in them, and the number of unemployed and who receive money from the government when out of employment remains about the same, at an average of about three million persons. The railways, whose reports give a very good index of trade, are losing money week by week; the present year’s reports show a heavy drop on last year’s. The ships which have been Britain’s pride are lying idle in the estuaries. All round the country this is the ease. In quiet places vessels up to 10,000 tons can be counted up to a score. It may perhaps be said that shipping more than anything else reveals the real activity of trade in the British Isles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The poor world is surely in. its death troubles. Its pride </span><span class="font9">is </span><span class="font8">lessening; its statesmen take a very different attitude in these days from that formerly boasted in. However, there is plenty of money on deposit in the banks, as their returns disclose, and the death-rattle does not seem to be imminent. As in view of this, and that even those out of work get some money every week, it is apparent there is a possibility of placing literature in the hands of the people, especially in view of the lowered cost. The fact that this year shows so good a measure of placements by the brethren is sure proof of this; and as the territory is by no means exhausted, but in some senses may even be said to be virgin soil, it is as if the Lord were telling us to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So we look forward to continued privileges of witnessing, and with good heart and a sincere desire to do the work which Jehovah has appointed out of love for his name, as well as from a hatred of the iniquitous system which has blinded the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am glad to add to this that the Bethel family continues to enjoy its privilege of sharing in the output of the literature, as well as the work of sending them out to the brethren. During the past year 9,821 books and booklets have been placed and 36,388 testimonies given. The activity of the office is in a measure represented by the following: Letters received, 53,246 ; dispatched, 55,751; and 27,007 packed parcels dispatched.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Dominion of Canada covers a large area of the earth’s surface, and, with this in mind, the population is small. The Canadian branch office maintained at Toronto has the responsibility of the immediate operation of the Society’s work in Canada and Newfoundland. In view of the great distress that still continues in that land, it was hardly to be expected that the service work would increase during the year, but it is gratifying to know that the fiscal year ending in September, 1932, shows a decided increase over the previous years. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am thankful to the Lord for the privilege of once again forwarding to you an annual report concerning the activities </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada and Newfoundland, on this occasion for the year ending September 30, 1932. As we would naturally expect with the onward march of our </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font8">g to victory the reports reveal that the witness given in these lands far surpassed any year heretofore. I am gratfeful to the Lord for the privilege of having a part in the wonderful work of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">LITERATURE DISTRIBUTION: Despite the economic depression this country is experiencing in common with all other parts of the world, a depression never equaled in its history, and despite the opposition of the Devil’s agents, it is a joy indeed to note that the Lord has blessed the effort of his people in no uncertain way, evidenced by the fact that the total number of books and booklets placed amounted to 902,890, to compare with 801,092 last year. Of this number, 176,919 were bound volumes; as compared with 125,959 of the previous year, an increase of 40.4 percent; and 725,971 were booklets, to compare with 675,143 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is of interest to note that included in the total distribution were 140,601 pieces of literature in foreign languages, of which 17,255 were bound volumes. AR told, these books and booklets were distributed amongst people of thirty-six different nationalities, the larger number being among the French, Ukrainian, German and Polish, in the order mentioned. Last year there were 103,890 foreign books and booklets placed, of which number 14,518 were bound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To accomplish this mighty witness 1,794,855 testimonies were given, literature was placed with 562,287 obtainers, and 360,784 hours were spent in the field by an average weekly army of 961.2. In this respect it is gratifying to note that we have surpassed in every detail our objective set at the beginning of the year, it being as follows: Testimonies, 1,400,000; hours 320,000; average weekly workers, 865; books, 169,100; booklets, 614,000; total pieces of literature, 783,100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TESTIMONY PERIODS: In harmony with your policy of having testimony periods, and synchronizing therewith, six special periods were held throughout Canada and Newfoundland during the year. The friends loyally responded to the call, and these united attacks upon the enemy organization have been the means of greatly increasing the witness over what otherwise would have been accomplished. The results in this connection were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Books Bklts. Total Test. Obtrs. Hours Wkrs, Testimony Wk. 5,249 29,484 34,733 62,922 26,962 10,982 1,319 Bound-Book</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">PIONEERS: During the year a monthly average of 152 pioneers were active in the field work, to compare with 90.6 last year, the largest number reporting in any one month being 190. This little army has carried on the work with that zeal peculiar to the household of faith. They have met with most distressing conditions everywhere, and not alone have endured much opposition by Satan’s instruments, but have suffered hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. The Lord has blessed their efforts in no uncertain way, evidenced by the fact that they placed during the year literature as follows: Bound books, S3,234, to compare with 56,636 last year; booklets 309.733, te compare with 208,050. They have given 824,308 testimonies, to compare with 386,609, and placed literature with 232,496 obtainers, to compare with 115,726; spending 170,502 hours in the field, to compare with 99,703 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These faithful workers, in harmony with Jesus’ prophecy, have been haled into courts and called upon to bear witness before magistrates and rulers, but, thanks be te God, victory has been obtained in almost every instance. Outstanding in this regard was the arrest of three of our brethren recently in Hull, Quebec, a place 95 percent Roman Catholic. At the instigation of a Roman Catholic priest they were charged with distributing seditious literature. It was a serious charge and involved a minimum jail sentence of five years and a maximum of twenty. At first it was thought advisable to engage attorneys to defend the brethren, but in harmony with your advice it was decided to have them make their own defense, using the brief prepared by you and sent to all companies; and, by the grace of the Lord and in His spirit, they faced the enemy with courage and boldness and gave a good witness. One of the three was chosen to present the defense, and he proceeded to read to the court the entire </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font8"> booklet. The judge, however, stopped him, saying he would read it for himself. He took ample time to look up in the Bible each Scriptural citation, told the crown prosecutor that these could be found in the regular Douay Bible, and the judge copied down every citation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were many outstanding points in the trial, but possibly the most outstanding came when the defense cited the scripture, “Buttake heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils [that means courts]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them”; to which the judge replied, “You were not surprised then when they brought you into court I ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The judge, Judge Achim, was fair, kind and indulgent. At the opening of the trial the brethren were nervous. Halfway through to the end the tables were turned, and the crown prosecutor was most uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was a great victory for the Lord’s cause and has taught us that there is little use of our fighting the case as the world would fight, by technicalities and law. We do not know law. The thing to do is to make out our own case according to the Scriptures and let the prosecutors try to pick holes in it; and that is tiuth, and they cannot touch it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the cold winter months the pioneers were organized into various camps concentrating their efforts on the larger cities and towns. Arrangements were made to rent a large house in each center worked, for the housing and boarding of the pioneers. When that city was covered the camp moved on to another large city, where similar arrangements for their accommodation were carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the summer and fall months the brethren have been banded together in convention troops which sweep over the rural territory and smaller towns and villages. In this branch of the work they travel by car and have with them their own facilities for camping, very much after the old caravan style. Then, too, the local friends at the points served cooperate in providing accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These methods have been found to be the most economical for carrying on the work, and also the most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">COMPANIES, AUXILIARIES AND SHARPSHOOTERS: The activities of the companies throughout the length and breadth of the land have been most encouraging indeed. They have zealously pressed the battle at the gate, and have gone forth with a unity and oneness that is worthy of every commendation. When, recently, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> suggested a reorganization, there was a ready acceptance from coast to coast of the suggestions, and the companies everywhere are now reorganized in harmony therewith. As might be expected, never in the history of the church has there been such harmony and unity as today. The prayer of the Lord’s people for peace in Zion has been abundantly answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The auxiliary witnesses too, while few in number, have obtained good results, and our hope is that the number engaged in that phase of the service will substantially increase during the ensuing year; for it is felt that many could engage therein who for some reason have not seen their way clear to take advantage of this privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many are the encouraging and gratifying reports of the activities of the sharpshooters in their isolated fields. These brethren joined forces with the convention troops when they were in their vicinity, and were greatly blessed thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SERVICE CONVENTIONS: During the year six convention circuits were in operation and, all told, 301 conventions were held; 291 being for the English-speaking brethren, and 10 for the foreign. These conventions accounted for the placement of 141,521 books and booklets, of which number 28,629 were bound volumes. There were 234,202 testimonies given, and literature was placed in the hands of 77,429 people, 65,654 hours being spent in the field. The average number of daily workers at the conventions was 38.1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will, of course, realize that the great bulk of these conventions were held in isolated scattered territory where a few friends are located. The object in this was twofold; To give a witness throughout the territory in cooperation with the local friends, and to encourage all in their efforts to sing forth His praises. A tremendous territory is covered that could not be covered in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As illustrative of the great joy the workers receive in this service and also of the difficulties with which they have to contend, we quote from a report of the regional service director in charge of the British Columbia convention series which has just been concluded:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ The territory in the interior is very difficult to work, being to a large extent unmapped and also uninhabited. This is particularly true of the Cariboo highway between Lillooet and Prince George. Maps are also deceiving; thus a road, marked as a ‘well traveled road’, contained hills that no car ever climbed, and necessitated our returning on our tracks over 80 miles, thus covering 160 miles unnecessarily. Information was sometimes unreliable. The convention series, however, particularly in the interior, was a source of great encouragement to the friends, and also of surprise. Of surprise in this, that so much was accomplished in the way of placements in their territory which they had considered more or less barren. The joy and enthusiasm of the troop also had its effect. The friends all along the way cooperated splendidly, doing everything they could to assist, such as looking after the temporal needs of the troop, doing their laundry, cooking, etc., and thus enabling them to put more time in the actual service than would otherwise have been possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This year a convention troop was sent up into the far-flung Peace River country covering a territory hundreds of miles north of Edmonton. There, as elsewhere, conditions are very distressing, but the results well justified the campaign. While it was found that in that country there are not many radio receiving sets, nevertheless the message was not at all new, for a number had heard it by radio, and others by the activities of lone pioneers. The people were anxious for the literature, and many pieces were placed. A number of letters expressing appreciation of the convention service in this district have been received, characteristic of which is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘‘Just a line to express our appreciation of the privilege of accompanying the group of Jehovah’s witnesses on their Peace River tour. This has been a source of great encouragement to us to keep on ‘pressing the battle at the gate’. We have noted the many tokens of the Lord’s favor with the company from point to point throughout the entire period, also the fine spirit manifested by the members of the group, and the harmony prevailing. There certainly has been a good witness given, and arrangements have been made to further carry on the good work ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS: Inasmuch as the original purpose of the regional service directors to organize companies for service woik has been accomplished, it has seemed best to utilize their services in a slightly different manner. For that reason, during the winter months, they weie placed in charge of the pioneer camps in carrying on the campaign in the larger centers, and in the summer and fall months they served as chairmen of the various convention seiies, thus cooperating again with the pioneers in the rural territory. The testimony is that these services have been greatly appreciated by the pioneers and the friends everywhere; and not alone have the regional directors ably directed the workers in the field in this way, but their own personal results in the door-to-door service have also been a stimulus to the friends. Their services have been richly blessed of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">RADIO: While for one reason or another two or three of the stations we were broadcasting over a year ago are no longer sending forth the message of truth, others have taken their places; and today we are broadcasting over exactly the same number of stations as in 1931, namely, 21. These stations are bioadcasting a total of 42 electrical transcriptions per week, as against 24 last year, and truly this means of witnessing is doing a tremendous work, not alone breaking down prejudice on every hand, but also opening up the way before the Lord’s army so that when they call upon the people with the literature they time and again receive a warm welcome. Many are the encouraging letters received from radio fans in reference to this phase of the service, but space will not permit to quote them here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will be interested to know that the most powerful Toronto station, one of 10,000 watts, which, in common with all other Toronto stations, has persistently refused to accept any of our broadcasts heretofore, has just recently agreed to broadcast two electrical transcript messages a week. This station, we understand, was largely financed by Roman Catholics, and they, until recently, broadcast over it, as also did one other prominent clergyman of this city, who, in common with the Catholics, was very active in forcing the Society’s Toronto station off the air a few years ago. When we were forced off the air we were broadcasting over a station of 500 watts. We have come back, by the Lord’s grace, on a station of 10,000 watts, and neither of these opponents who served the interests of the Devil is now broadcasting. Truly it is the Lord’s doing, and marvelous, in our eyes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">GENERAL: More and more it is manifest on every hand that the people are losing all respect for churchianity in general and ecclesiastical rulers in particular, and these systems are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. The financial and political wings of Satan’s organization are greatly bewildered and are at their wits’ end to know how to meet the distressing conditions which confront them. The spirit of unrest and discontent is everywhere prevalent; and the rumbling of what was a distant storm gives every evidence, as that rumbling becomes louder and louder, that the storm is at hand, even at the door, and it would seem that almost any day will see the breaking forth of that condition spoken of by the Master as the time of great tribulation such as was not since there was a nation. Truly men’s hearts are failing them for fear, looking forward to those conditions coming upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These very conditions, however, are a source of much strength to the faith of the Lord’s anointed who, while not increased in number, are ever increasing in zeal and fervor, pressing the battle at the gate and doing with their might what their hands find to do. It is a joy to watch their spirit, their boldness, their courage, that is inspired by their abounding faith in the great Captain of their salvation and Jehovah as the only true God. They have faithfully and persistently spread the message of truth throughout the lengths and breadths of these lands. Territory lias been done over and over again; but it is of interest to note that despite the number of times the territory has been witnessed to it is still very productive of results. Truly it is a great joy to be numbered in His army and to have any share, no matter how apparently insignificant, in this glorious work of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord, ever watchful of the interests of his people, has seen to it that he has through his organization fed them with ever increasing light; and Books Two and Three of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font8">together with the booklets recently received, have been a source of tremendous strength and encouragement to his army. It is indeed their meat and their drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gieat as has been the witness during the past year, and fascinating as it has been to watch the onward march of world events revealing Satan’s forces marching on to the great battle of God Almighty, the workers everywhere in these lands look forward to the ensuing year with keen expectation and joy, feeling that beyond question the incoming year will result in an even greater shaking of Satan’s organization and a greater witness concerning God’s kingdom, with many rich blessings and strengthening experiences for his people along the way. Particularly is anticipated the joy of the release of the Jehonadab class from the bondage of Satan’s organization. Blessed indeed are those who shall have a share in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been my privilege during the year to visit the companies and pioneer camps from coast to coast, and all have expressed the desire that I should convey to you their Christian love and greeting and should assure you of their wholehearted support in your faithful and fearless stand for Jehovah and his people and against Satan and his organization; and I have great pleasure in taking advantage of this opportunity to so do, and at the same time to convey to you the love and esteem of the Bethel family here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font9">China is not considered a part of “Christendom”, of course; but professed Christians have done missionary work in that land, and there are some who have heard of Jehovah and his kingdom. Recently the Society has opened a branch office at Shanghai, and the work is beginning there with good prospects, and we hope to be able to report in a more encouraging manner later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font9">Czechoslovakia is one of the countries carved following the World War. The residents of that country are of different nationalities, and the Society finds it necessary to carry on the work there in the following languages: Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, German, Ukrainian, Rumanian and Bulgarian. Jehovah’s witnesses often find it necessary to go into the field with books published in eight different languages. Where they are unable to speak all these languages, they carry cards containing the printed testimony in other languages, •which cards they exhibit to the people and thus facilitate their work. The enemy has made strenuous efforts throughout the year to injure the work in that land; hence the workers have had to encounter many difficulties. The Lord has kept his hand over them, however, and given his blessing to those who faithfully served him. The output of literature into the hands of the people in that land during the year has greatly increased over the previous year, notwithstanding the opposition; 84,501 bound books and 262,165 booklets being placed. This has been a splendid increase over the previous year.- The total number of hours worked by these faithful workers was 127,560, and within that time they gave testimonies to the number of 930,711.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pioneers did the major portion of the work in Czechoslovakia. Out of the total amount of literature placed during the year, the pioneers put in the hands of the people 57,500 books and 150,874 booklets. The number of pioneers increased from 32 to 84, 54 of these having come from Germany into that country to work. The enemy caused the German brethren to suffer many hardships, by stirring up strife against them amongst the natives. Many of the brethren have suffered imprisonment, while others have been banished from the country. In every instance the accuser was a clergyman who incited the populace against one of Jehovah’s witnesses. These brethren were not deterred, however, in their work. As soon as released from prison they went on again in the service; and these faithful pioneers worked 86,322 hours and delivered 672,189 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> magazine has been an efficient means of preparing the way for the truth in that land. Of this magazine, 71,200 copies were placed in the hands of the people; and this opened the way for them to have further literature. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> has been published during the year in the Czech language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year, films of the Photo<sup>J</sup>Drama and other (still) pictures were used, and this attracted the attention of many of the people and afforded an opportunity to give the witness. Thirteen performances in the Czech and ‘German languages were had, with 59,480 persons present; and to these were delivered 2,872 books and 4,390 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A general convention of God’s people was held at Praha, Czechoslovakia, during the year. About 1,500 consecrated attended the convention from that and other countries round about. This furnished a splendid opportunity to give a testimony to the kingdom. The public ^attended in great numbers. There were placed in the hands of the people 6,174 books and 15,597 booklets. Smaller conventions were held in other parts of the country during the year. The brethren in Czechoslovakia are greatly enthused, and continue to press the work, regardless of all difficulties and opposition.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the Northern European office that is maintained at Copenhagen, the Society has a local manager that, together with the other brethren associated with him, confines his efforts to the country of Denmark. The work in that country, although hindered, as elsewhere, by enemies, has steadfastly moved forward during the year. The total number of books and booklets distributed in the small land of Denmark in that period of time was 255,642. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Never before have the remnant who are serving as Jehovah’s witnesses in the small area called Denmark experienced a year so glorious as the one just ended. Surely we are in the kingdom, and the Lord himself is leading his army on to victory! How can we but rejoice and be th</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ankf</span><span class="font8">ul </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">One of</span><span class="font8"> the moat wonderful events in this eventful year was the International Thanksgiving Period. When the early issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> with the inspiring article on the Memorial reached us, we were just expecting the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets from Bern, and had arranged for a great Kingdom work period for the whole of March. Now we were enabled to celebrate the Memorial with a better and fuller understanding, in the middle of a real kingdom feast, and at the same time, as a fresh and refreshing start for the most natural of all periods, the giving of thanks to Jehovah, finishing off with calling upon, the rulers. It was a grand time never to be forgotten, and greatly increasing our thankfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was my privilege to call upon the king of Denmark, telling him that Jehovah now has set his King upon his throne in Zion. When I told him that none of the present kingdoms were Christ’s kingdom, but were organized by Satan, he said: “Well, I must admit that everybody is trying selfishly to profit as best he can, even at the expense of (his fellow men.’’ And when I went on to say that all the present kingdoms, therefore, shortly will go to pieces in Armageddon, he frankly admitted that “it most certainly looks like it’’. No doubt he can see something of what is coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gog, or some powerful member of his crowd, has got busy here during the year. To control and minimize the import, the government has established what is termed the Valuta Office. This office is authorized to refuse the importation of any goods they might choose to prevent from entering the country. And in March they chose to completely stop the coming in of our books. At first it looked as if we could do nothing, and that the 135,000 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets which had already arrived in the Free Harbor had been printed in vain; further it meant that all the other books, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation, Life, Prophecy</span><span class="font8"> and several booklets that were being printed, would never get into the country. But we knew better. Twice we had been, turned down Nevertheless, we now pointed out to the officials that this work could not be stopped, and that it was essential that the books be released from the Customs the very next day. This was done, in spite of all regulations; and what is more, we obtained permission to import all the books we wanted during the year. How was this possible? Ourselves, we had done nothing to obtain this favor; so there can only be one answer: It was the Lord’s doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the Gog crowd tries to come back on us. A new law has been passed, making it compulsory for everyone who wants to go from house to house with goods of any kind to apply for a peddlers’ license. The fee is very small, that is true; but then, of course, we cannot go out with our message on Sundays, nor after closing hours on ordinary days. However, we are not peddlers, and therefore are not going to apply. Our one and only concern is to obey the Lord’s commandment, ‘This gospel of the kingdom must be preached!’ and we are going to do our part, realizing that God’s laws are superior to the laws of man. This new law has been put into power today; so you see, dear Brother Rutherford, this opens up wonderful prospects for us for the incoming year, promising us rich opportunities of seeing how the Lord cares for his own, in his own way. It just thrills our hearts!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the annexed report you will notice that there is some decrease in the number of big books. This, however, is more than made up for by the enormous increase in the output of booklets. Besides, the books spread last year were chiefly the old </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Studies,</span><span class="font8"> which were offered to the people for an exceptionally small contribution. This year we have sent out 18,310 of the up-to-date books, against 12,067 last year, and the grand total of literature sent out from our office is 255,642, against 121,419. This is a record in our work so far, and it makes us very thankful to the Lord, who has so blessed our efforts to give honor to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world-wide financial crisis is making itself felt very badly. The farmers (the backbone of the country) are in distress, not being able to pay the interest on their mortgages, or their taxes; and in the towns lots of families are all out of work. Only Jehovah’s witnesses are getting more and more busy. More company workers, more pioneers and auxihanes, and many more hours spent in the work. The number of company workers this year is 489, and the average number of pioneers and auxiliaries has been 32, against 455 and 15, respectively, last year. In 1931 I was happy to report that more than 200,000 testimonies had been given, that is, a testimony for every fourth family of Denmark’s three and a half millions. This year 420,502 have been given, or one for every second family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the conventions practically all the friends are participating in the service. We all realize more and more that Jehovah’s service is the only thing that counts. After the Copenhagen convention, in the beginning of September, several friends joined the ranks of the pioneers, so we are making a good start for the new year. We also have more books now. Last year we had only four of our big books, besides the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Studies; </span><span class="font8">now we have eight books, the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font8">th </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span><span class="font8"> on the way from Magdeburg, the tenth, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Book One is being proofread, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Book Two has been translated, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> Book Three is now being translated, and we are already looking forward to the treat we feel sure the Lord has in store for us in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span><span class="font8"> So we are entering the new year with waving banners, with great expectations, great enthusiasm, and great thankfulness to the Lord, the Giver of it alh</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTHONIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font9">Esthonia’s manager makes an interesting report of the increased interest and greater amount of work done in that country during the fiscal year. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet especially stirred up interest, and it was distributed amongst the clergy and their allies as well as amongst the people in general. From the report of the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again I have the privilege of sending you the annual report of the work done in the Esthonian part of the field. Although there have been many difficulties, the year just closed has been one of much joy. The friends are coming to see more and more that the mission of a Christian now on earth is to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and to preach the gospel of the kingdom. This progress has been made more manifest since the beginning of our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet campaign. Friends who had never before taken any part in the witness work were roused to activity by the message contained in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font8">booklet. Everyone was enthused by that special message and work. Quickly they got into line with the instructions issued so that the kingdom work might be done speedily. Adherence to the simple introduction for the literature, issued by the Society, proved to give the best results; and when one says, “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses,” the attention of the people is immediately arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report shows that during the past year a total of 2,505 books and 40,781 booklets were sent out from the depot at Tallinn. This is a greater quantity of literature, by 24,816 pieces, than was sent out during last year. The increase is due chiefly to the fact that we had a campaign booklet, two new booklets, and two new pioneers. During the winter, which is severe, every effort is made to allocate the pioneers’ territory in the towns. This is not always possible, because Esthonia is a small parcel of land, hardly sustaining its million inhabitants. Last winter one Esthonian and three Finnish sisters went on foot, and often on ski, from eroft to eroft in order to spread the message of the kingdom. Many difficulties were encountered; the cold was intense; comfortable lodgings were scarce; and food, the mere necessities, was of a rough-and-ready kind. Notwithstanding these conditions, the pioneers had joy in thus opening up new territory, and the spreading of the truth went steadily forward. Throughout the year, an average number of 8 pioneers spread -34,952 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Sunday afternoons the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font8"> formed a text book for study at 24 meetings, with a total attendance of 179. In the winter months three special meetings for the public were arranged in country towns where very little had ever been done. Many people, mostly women, came to hear lectures on “The Last Days” and “Where Are the Dead?” There was a total audience of 900, and 103 books and booklets were then distributed. At the moment of writing, a series of five public meetings is being conducted in the south of Esthonia. Those attending show much interest, but most of them are too<sup>1</sup> poor to avail themselves of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the Tallinn radio station the kingdom message continues to be broadcast each Sunday afternoon. During three summer months this station was used for half an hour to send out the message in the Esthonian and Eussian languages. Arrangements were made to use the radio during the remaining nine months in order to broadcast in the Esthonian, Eussian, Finnish and Swedish languages, each for quarter of an hour. In addition to the local station, a substation has been in use from the beginning of the month of March, onward. The latter station is situated in the center of Esthonia, in the university city of Tartu, and greatly improves the reception of the lectures in the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two transcription records, each bearing a lecture delivered by you, were received in the month of June. The titles of the lectures are '‘The World’s Hope, the Kingdom” and “The Permission of Evil”. It afforded pleasure to listen to one of these discourses; and to hear your voice, which is excellently reproduced by the records, gave a wonderful thrill. Throughout the year, 178 radio talks have been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is evidence that the radio lectures are being heard in Bussia, for it has been reported by a brother in Latvia that a broadcast was sent out recently by the powerful Stalin radio station, warning against certain ones who are speaking about financiers, politicians and clergy, and who are antirevolutionists. This statement undoubtedly referred to Jehovah’s witnesses and to the testimony they are giving against the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each month a Bulletin, composed chiefly of extracts taken from the Bulletins received from Brooklyn, has been sent out to 40 to 60 persons. The total number of bulletins sent out is 617. Special letters to pioneers and other workers number 244. The letters received during the year are 361 in number, and those sent out, 671.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The distress and perplexity have reached all peoples in all parts of the earth, and Finland came in for her share. In spite of all this trouble and suffering, however, the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses in spreading the message of Jehovah and his kingdom has increased, in the fiscal year just closed, more than 28 percent over the previous year. From the report of the local manager at Helsingfors the following is extracted :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Very great crowds have been without work, getting food only at public halls for nothing, and other great crowds have been so poorly paid that very many have been compelled to leave their work, because they have calculated that the wear and tear during the work is greater than the little amount which is paid for the work. And when people have no money to buy, a great number of business men have come into gieat difficulties, prices have gone down, especially concerning the foodstuff. For that reason the farmers do not know what to do. They have been compelled to sell their farms; but, as there has been such a number of such farms, there have been no people to buy the farms, and so the confusion has been very great. And perhaps the most peculiar item in the whole matter is that when the prices have gone down the value of our money compared with foreign coin has also gone down much. To explain the matter I will only mention an example. It is not very long ago when 1 dollar was about 40 fmk., but 1 kilo butter also cost 40 fmk. But now 1 dollar is 67 fmk. and 1 kilo butter only 20 fmk. From that you can understand a little the very awkward situation in which we are in our country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we take into consideration all these circumstances, it is no wonder if all in Finland complain over the severe time in which we are living. For that reason it is a great joy to see how the Lord’s work still has gone forward in our country. It is true that we have not been able to come to such results as we had desired, but it will certainly be a joy for you to know that the outspread of books has increased from 192,735 to 247,255, or 28 percent. That is the Lord’s doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been also interesting to see how the little groups of Jehovah’s witnesses in Finland have more and more appreciated their privilege; and although the number out each week on average has increased only from 307 to 322, or 5 percent, the testimonies have gone up from 353,014 to 458,901, or 30 percent. That means that more than half of all the families in our country have got the witness in their homes; and the fact that we have been able to leave with them 358,805 pieces of literature shows that the message has been received with appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work done by the company workers during the year has increased 23 percent, and that by the pioneers and auxiliaries, 37 percent, over the previous year. These pioneers spent 29 hours a week in the field at work and 19 hours in travel, or a total of 38 hours weekly in the service; one pioneer even putting in 71 hours a week for work and travel combined. These carry their own books by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have been very grateful for all the exhortations we have gotten through the publications of the Society, provided by the dear Lord as food in due time. In the beginning of the year we got, to our great joy, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font8"> and then the very wonderful books, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font8"> Book One and Book Two. Then for the time when the prohibition question was very burning, appeared the booklet just entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition.</span><span class="font8"> That it appeared very timely is proved by the fact that the prohibition fell in our country soon after the booklet had been spread among the people. For our big spring push appeared the great interest-causing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. What a stimulus, and what a time we had with that booklet! It opened many doors which had been formerly closed. And just for the end of the year we are getting the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font8"> booklet. In this connection it is just proper to mention </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> which has during the whole year provided us with the most heart-rejoicing matters; and when I with great thankfulness am reading the articles filled with precious treasures, I am almost perplexed why only such a little group appreciate such a wonderful paper. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> has also done a good work. Only, many should like to see it to appear more often than once a month. On account of many unfavorable circumstances the list of subscribers for these papers has gone down during the year; but as we have been so busy with the placing of books, we have not been able to fix so much attention for the papers, but we hope during the next year to be able to use still better our time, so that we may get a little more for our papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year there have been held 31 conventions. The last and biggest one was just held, in Helsinki. All the conventions have been very encouraging for the brethren, who have with great joy gone out in the service. At the conventions were present 2,156, of which 52 were baptized; 1,034 took part in the service, and placed 12,559 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our little printing plant has been a great blessing in the work. The previous year we printed books, 1,060; magazines, 209,500; bulletins, 8,713; folders with message, 48,550; forms, etc., 117,095; or, together, 385,118. This year we have got from our own printing plant books,' 25,531; magazines, 271,700; bulletins, 14,930; folders with message, 215,875; forms, etc., 188,244; or, together, 716,280; which shows an increase of 331,162, or 88 percent. At a printing plant outside the office we had not been able to pay away the rest of the cost of the machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although we are surrounded with many difficulties, yet the outlook for the coming year is very inspiring as much as it concerns the remnant. We hope to have the first book of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> ready very soon, and the work with the second is begun. The work with the nice new booklets is also already well on. The organization is woiking ever better; so we in Finland are well equipped for the duties the dear Lord may give us during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The kingdom witness work in France is in a much healthier condition at the close of this fiscal year. Decided progress has been made during the year. The radio has added greatly to the increase of the work. Four radio stations have regularly broadcast the kingdom message during the year, making a total of 324 lectures delivered by radio. These four radio stations have good coverage throughout France and adjoining countries, including England. Hundreds of letters have been received at the Paris office from the radio listeners, who have greatly praised the programs and asked that they be continued and have ordered literature. The clergy, of course, have not lilted the radio, and they have published letters in the press and taken other means to interfere with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are now. engaged in France 68 organized companies. These include French, Germans, and Poles. There are 85 full-time pioneers in the service, some of these having come from other countries outside of France; also 22 auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DIFFICULTIES: During the year mans’- difficulties have been encountered. The clergy have put forth a strenuous effort to induce the governmental authorr-ties to stop the work. The result has been 105 warrants issued against the workers. These have ultimately resulted in favor of the Lord’s witnesses, with the exception of one case. Other difficulties include the unemployment, which has now reached France. In the face of all of these difficulties, the distribution has been far above what it was heretofore. France has compelled some of the brethren from other countries to leave, and this has reduced the force somewhat. Amongst those sent out of the country were a number of Polish brethren. Those remaining, however, are becoming more zealous. There are now 100 motorcycles, 4 ears and 2 big buses used regularly in the service. Alsace is now French territory; and when Poles and Germans were expelled from France, brethren from Alsace came forward and took their place, and the work continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year 1932, 796 workers were engaged in the service 202,723 hours, and placed in the hands of the people 63,383 bound books, 902,425 booklets, or 965,808 books and booklets, in addition to the Bibles that were distributed. From the Society’s local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus with the help of the pioneer troops all of Eranee was occupied and covered once for the first time. Some English and German pioneers, &quot;eight in all, without mastering the French language have even pushed on to North Africa into the French colonies. The results were great beyond expectation. There was hardly as much literature placed in another territory as in the North African countries. On the average each one distributed about 200 books and about 2,000 booklets per month. These pioneers covered large sections with then car, and they even entered the outlying French military barracks and witnessed to the soldiers of the Foreign Legion with success. It was to be expected that the Devil had wrath, and thus he eaused the arrest of the brethren. They were charged to be spies; but the mighty arm of Jehovah delivered them soon after. Then the Devil caused the fearless workers to be attacked by robbers. While the brethren sustained a' small loss in a material way, their spirit and their joy was not quenched, because they proceeded the next day with their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year we also held nine regional service conventions, with special opportunities of sei vice. These were attended, on the average, by 1,000 to 1,200 friends. At such occasions 135 brethren, 7 French, the others Poles, were baptized, and it was remarkable that most of the newly baptized were brethren of younger years, between 16 and 20. They are Jehovah’s youth, and often children of the anointed who for some years had paiticipated in the service. At one of these conventions 12 warrants were issued against us by the police, but the lawsuit which followed resulted in greater liberty for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Polish there were held 6 public lectures, with 290 attendants, 344 lectures in company gatherings, with 9,890 attending, and nine regional service conventions, with 4,100 friends present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the French language 10 speeches were given in company gatherings, with 250 attendants, 4 funeral services were held, whereby the witness was given to a total audience of 300, and four regional service conventions, with an attendance of 390 brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an interesting item we might report the experiences of one company. Some time ago, seven pioneers, Poles, had settled in a town in the vicinity of Paris in order to work the entire region. Soon a group of interested persons gathered around them. A company was formed. A child of one of the pioneers' died, and another pioneer held the funeral speech at the cemetery. The whole village turned out to see what these churchless “Bible Students” would do at the funeral. When it was evident that the thing made a greater impression than when the priest held the funeral, the priest tried his utmost to have these witnesses of Jehovah expelled, and in this he finally succeeded; but the company which remained continued to give the witness. These newly interested in the truth brought four motorcycles, which caused great comment, and these new brethren are working large districts. Then the priest and also the mayor of the town put forth their strength to destroy the whole company. They sought to influence the manager of a factory where most of the friends were employed to have these workers discharged; but the manager declared that he was satisfied with these men, and he refused to dismiss them. Now these two “noble” gentlemen, posing as leaders, have taken steps to bring about the expulsion of the members of this company. The brethren continued, and suddenly the mayor died without having been sick. Soon after the priest received his reward. He nearly lost his eyesight through a disease. These things have caused much comment, and no one can explain why. Anyway, they are no longer interfering with the witnesses there, and they even have a certain respect for them. It proves again how the Lord is ready to safeguard the interests of his children. A similar case happened at Enghien, where the Society owns a home to house the office workers. The priest and other higher-ups caused the expulsion of some of our office workers. This happened during the Kingdom Week. One of our workers sent a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet to the priest, and two days later the priest died, i.e., within a fortnight after he had caused the expulsion of our brethren. These things cause some to take notice, and nothing can keep the witnesses from continuing in the precious service.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">At Magdeburg, Germany, the Society maintains a Bethel home and a factory for the manufacturing of books and booklets and other literature. For some time this factory has turned out a large amount of literature for Germany and other countries. During the year, our factory at Magdeburg has produced the following:</span></p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:bottom;">

<p><span class="font9">27,562,000</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the work of printing and manufacturing as above stated, the correspondence required a great deal of work. Letters received totaled, 93,345; dispatched 84,367. Parcels shipped totaled 390,737.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">BETHEL FAMILY: The family at Magdeburg, as elsewhere, enjoy the great privilege of working together and spending their time together in the home. The family there engage in a regular study every Monday evening, the same as the Bethel family at Brooklyn and other places. The reports show that the family have been greatly strengthened and enthused by this study. They have a better appreciation of the vindication of Jehovah’s name and why they are permitted to serve him now. From the report of the local manager we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A great deal was required this year of the factory and of the Bethel family. That made it necessary to work on most of the machines for a great part of the time in three shifts, and otherwise over in two shifts. These demands made it impossible this year to follow the custom to close the factory and the office for some days on the occasion of service weeks. Bor that reason not as much literature as in the previous year has been spread by the Bethel family, but the members of the Bethel family participated whenever possible every Sunday in the house-to-house work and put a good quantity of literature in the hands of the people. This year 813,159 more books and 306,717 more booklets have been put out from the Magdeburg printery than in the previous -fiscal year. The number of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> copies printed was 1,050,000 more than the previous year,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;WITNESS WORK: The reports from Germany give further evidence that Jehovah is having his witness work carried forth regardless of anything that the enemy and. his agents are able to do. The output of books and booklets during the fiscal year in Germany exceeds that of any previous year. The annual report for the fiscal year shows the following distribution : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bound books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,054,982</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,582,681</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Grand total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,637,663</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">OPPOSITION: Satan, with his field marshal Gog leading the conspirators, has done everything in his power to hinder and destroy the work in Germany during the year. The Lord, however, has kept his hand over his people, and amidst all these wicked efforts of the enemy Jehovah’s witness work has gone grandly forward. The following extract is taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The opposition of the enemy increased greatly this year. Eveiy means has been employed to stop the faithful witnesses in their march onward. The tremendous witness challenged the rage of the enemy. In Bavaria and Wurttemberg, two states of the German Reich, the respective governments forbade nearly all of the literature and its distribution, and many confiscations took place and also arrests. Nevertheless, Jehovah’s witnesses kept on marching, and recently the Lord again cleared the way, because new decrees of the government reversed the interdiction; and now we are again able to do a better work in these states. Further, many legal proceedings were taken against friends on the charge of violation of ordinances regarding the Sunday rest or of the industrial law. In all, 1,797 new legal actions were opened this year, and the number of actions pending from the past year against Jehovah’s witnesses was 2,335. It may easily be seen how the opposition of the enemy increased in comparison with the witness work The Lord has hardened the foreheads of his people as an adamant, and so they went on and became only more determined by the opposition of the enemy to carry on the witness work until the cities are desolated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">NEW NAME: God’s people in Germany have appreciated the name “Jehovah’s witnesses’’, which the Most High has given to those on earth who love and serve him. They have been greatly encouraged and spurred on to do the work that the Lord has given them to do. Many of the Lord’s witnesses in Germany have crossed the border into Czechoslovakia and helped to carry forward the work there. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Luxemburg are under the immediate supervision of the German office. It was thought best thus to advantage the work in order to facilitate the reports and better organize the field service. From the Society’s manager in Germany the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the last annual report it has been said the situation in Germany vent from bad to worse. In the fiscal year 1932 the distress increased even more, and in addition thereto the political passions have been stirred as never before. But that resulted in many people’s seeing now no help is to be expected from politics, and they begin to look for other help. The clergy took a very active part in politics, and this again helped the people to recognize the dishonesty and duplicity of this class; so the message of Jehovah’s witnesses found a fertile soil With much gratitude to the Lord we above all remember the wonderful food which the Lord gave his people through </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font8"> and these great truths made God’s people enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SERVICE WORK: Of course the most effective manner of activity was carried on through the service work. Efforts were made this year to still better organize the service work to greater efficiency. As everywhere new friends have been found which entered the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses, the organization of sharpshooters has been more built out. In the past year the number of companies and of small companies organized as sharpshooters amounted to 590. This year some of the smaller companies have been linked with the sharpshooters’ organization, so that the number of regularly organized companies was only 570 in this year. A good number more of smaller companies, however, have now been organized as sharpshooters, making now a total of 291 in this part of the organization; and therefore now 861 greater and smaller companies are linked with the service organization. That is an increase of 271 over the previous year. The Society further sent out </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">general summons to the witnesses of Jehovah to enter the service as auxiliary pioneers. Many friends are without employment, and many joyfully answered this call, so that the number of auxiliary pioneers is better by 396 at the end of this fiscal year. Details about that are given later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The service work in this fiscal year started with the great campaign with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. This spurred on the friends tremendously, and it was a great campaign in which even many participated that formerly did not have an active part in the service. Thereby the number of company workers mounted up to 12,589. The climax in the number of workers was reached at the time of spreading the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet, as therein many others besides the anointed took a part; then there were 14,453 workers. About 5,000,000 copies of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet have been printed, and the major part thereof have been spread. As everywhere all over the earth, this booklet was carried to the rulers, viz., 28,631 clergymen, 48,874 politicians, 15,946 financiers, and 4,473 high army officers. This strongly increased the rage of the enemy, but it has been the greatest witness ever given in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the kind permission of the president, the Magdeburg office also made a paper-bound edition of the books </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font8"> that enabled us to spread these books at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">low contribution. In this way, of course, the possibility of spreading the message was greatly increased, and the Lord obviously blessed this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total turnover of literature in this year was 1,307,228 more than in the previous year. By statistics we had shown in the last annual report that the year 1931 meant a climax in the distribution of literature, by taking six booklets as equal to one book and thus expressing the whole distribution in one number. That number was 1,874,281 for the past year; and it is 1,985,429 for this year. Therefore the fiscal year 1932 is by far on the top of all the years in which the testimony could be given in tins country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With regard to the number of books spread it must be taken into consideration that during two months the work was exclusively with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet, and further that the spreading was hindered by an interdiction of our literature in Bavaria, Wurttemberg and Baden, which lasted eight months. Else the number of books spread would doubtless be still better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The efforts made by the anointed may be easily seen from the number of hours spent. In the past year the company workers had spent 990,618 hours in the kingdom service; whereas they were 1,283,095 hours in the field service this year. They have shown the zeal peculiar to the house of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total number of hours spent in the kingdom service this year was 2,022,669, against 1,343,392 in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total of testimonies given was 13,788,796, viz., about 3,500,000 more than in the past year. Therefore nearly every family in Germany received the testimony of the kingdom this year. The total number of receivers of literature was 4,987,379, so that about every third family to which the testimony was given took literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the above figures it clearly appears that Jehovah blessed the efforts and the zeal of his people in this country. In fact, that is the Lord’s work. No human organization could carry on such a work with the same means; but Jehovah leads his work, and in that we rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PIONEERS: At the end of this fiscal year the number of pioneers is somewhat short of what it was in the previous year. It is now 291. The reason for that is partly that some of the territory formerly held by pioneers is now worked through by new companies and, on the other hand, a part of the pioneers went to Czechoslovakia and other countries to give the testimony there also. In spite of that, the pioneers made greater efforts than in the past year. Though less in number, they used 79,733 more hours in the field service and gave 2,870,624 testimonies. The number of books spread by pioneers was 222,084; of booklets, 862,974.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">AUXILIARY PIONEERS: The short remark has been made already that in this year we endeavored to organize the service of auxiliary pioneers to greater efficiency. Formerly the auxiliary pioneers gave their reports through the companies with winch they cooperated, but since December 1, 1931, they report directly to the Society. That gives the possibility of a direct control. This branch of the service has proved to be very efficient. The report of auxiliary pioneers covers only ten months, and in these ten months the auxiliary pioneers spent 307,067 hours in the field service and thereby gave 2,119,355 testimonies. In this way 142,064 books and 311,468 booklets have been laid in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SERVICE WEEKS: Service weeks have always proved to be a source of special joy for the .Lord’s people, and apparently they are caused by the Lord for the purpose of carrying on at a respective time a specially strong attack against the enemy’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The International Thanksgiving Testimony Week, above all, pointed the friends to their responsibility, when paitieipating in the symbols of the Memorial, to also have a part therein in reality. Besides the International Service Weeks special periods for the witness work have been set aside for Germany. A general survey of the results obtained in these service weeks is given in the following:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Just to start the new fiscal year the anointed unite themselves now to celebrate the feast of the kingdom, and we are hoping this week will be a good introduction for the new fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">DRAMA OF CREATION</span><span class="font8"> AND PUBLIC ACTIVITY: As long as we have no opportunity to reach the public by radio the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Drama of Creation,</span><span class="font8"> composed with texts from the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font8"> forms, besides </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> one of the most effective means to prepare the field for receiving the message. As before, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Drama of Creation</span><span class="font8"> could be shown in the fiscal year now ended in 209 places with good results. Number of attendants was 680,287. Thereby 22,843 books and 83,784 booklets were spread, and 6,520 subscribers for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Drama of Creation</span><span class="font8"> this fiscal year brought an increased activity with regard to public addresses, because the field is more favorable for such undertakings and people are really coining in masses to hear the message of the kingdom. There were given 1,841 public lectures, with 342,076 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It causes us great joy to see that many of those interested through the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Drama of Creation</span><span class="font8"> or through a public lecture are desirous of hearing more about Jehovah’s purposes, and there are 15,396 people of those interested by public activity this year who attend the current studies of the literature containing the truth. Some of them are beginning already to participate in the proclamation. Perhaps that may mean the beginning of the fulfilment of the picture of Jehonadab, that many honest and thinking men will join Jehovah’s witnesses. In every case we hope we can report in the coming year that the number of those taking an active part in the field service increased considerably. We thank the Lord that he leads new fighters to his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">TUD GOLDEN AGE:</span><span class="font8"> In spite of great opposition this branch of the work also shows a considerable increase. The Catholic church as well as political parties, the national socialist, for instance, have forbidden their members to read </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> and this resulted in a great number giving up the subscription. But Jehovah’s witnesses went onward and did not only repair these losses but got many more new subscribers; and now the number of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> copies that go out regularly is 440,000. The number of copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> which were spread is 10,910,000, instead of 9,900,000 previously; an increase of about 10 percent. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font8">is a good means to prepare the way for the message as well as to link together all those men of good will who want to take the side of the kingdom. The current publication of radio lectures furnishes them currently with important truths about Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">By the Lord’s grace some of his witnesses still continue to proclaim the message of truth in Greece, where in the early days of Christianity the message was carried by the apostles. The clergy continue to oppose and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, but they push on vigorously just the same. During the year the output of literature in Greece totaled 127,850 books and booklets in the Greek language, and in other languages 3,487; making a grand total of 131,337. From the local manager’s report at Athens the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the witness work here, with joy and thankfulness to the Lord I state that, notwithstanding the prevailing crisis in this country, especially this year, and the great poverty of the people in the country districts, and the lack of work, as well as the relentless opposition of the enemy organization, the witness work has been going on under the protection of the Lord. It is true that as to the giving out of bound books and booklets we came behind this year in comparison with the last two years, because of the inability of the people to buy them and'also because we tried to give the witness with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. There were instances where the people could not take even the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet in magazine form, though they gladly took the offered radiocast, “Who Is Jehovah?” Women sold to the grocers bowls full of corn which they had for their food, in order to be able to buy a booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again the clergy tried to stop the work of the Lord, but the Lord stood by his people and frustrated their machinations. The synod of bishops sent to the government a document asking that an article be inserted in the constitution ds a preventive measure against the work of witness throughout Greece. The government asked the opinion of the public prosecutor of the highest court, and he in turn issued an official opinion to the intent that no preventive measures can be taken, but that there could be taken repressive measures only in cases where it would be proved that these men practiced proselytism by illicit means; but not in cases where these men give merely a witness and sell their literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet was given to all the clergymen and preachers, and continues to be given as opportunity affords; also to the government officials, viz., the president of the democracy, the prime minister and all the ministers; parhament and congress members, the higher officers of army and navy, all the officers of the two bodies of police, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">judges of all the courts. To all of them it was given personally as far as possible. Many of them with a frown; and few of them refused to receive it or sent it back by post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This year we have had some trials in the courts, and two of the brethren were sent to jail for six months; others were sentenced to six-month and one-year terms but the higher courts to which they made appeal acquitted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work of witness here is generally done by company workers because conditions here are not favorable for pioneers, of which only five are working only part of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Realizing the great privilege of being of the servant class, by the grace of the Lord we will continue to give witness to his name and raise the banner of truth to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark240"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>GUIANA, BRITISH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The little country in the northeastern part of South America which is called British Guiana has a few of Jehovah’s witnesses who are zealous in trying to put forth the kingdom message. In 1931 this little company placed in the hands of the people 4,793 books and booklets. In the fiscal year of 1932 the placements were 13,603. From the local manager’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> campaign was begun here in October, when the first shipment arrived, and we have now about completed our testimony to the clergy and rulers. Of these booklets 6,858 were distributed during the year, and the work still proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have continued to deliver the witness in the towns and in as many villages and </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font8">ng centers as weather and funds permitted, but we have not been able to place many more bound books than we did in 1931; although our placements of booklets is about five times greater than that year. This is due in large measure to the financial depression, which is acute here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The acquisition, with your kind assistance, of a machine for reproducing the electrical records is greatly appreciated, and we hope to soon be able to use it in the rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We desire to express our appreciation to the Lord for all his benefits bestowed on us during the past year, not the least of which has been the loving care and ministrations of you and the other members of the Bethel home.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark242"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>HOLLAND (NETHERLANDS)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses in Holland is gratifying, and the Lord has added his blessing to their efforts during the fiscal year. The previous year the total amount of literature distributed was 40,000 books and booklets. In the fiscal year just closing there were placed in the hands of the people 152,844 books and booklets. From the report of the Society’s local representative in Holland the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Holland has always been very hard and stubborn territory. One hundred and seventy of the religious sects of the world have churches or congregations in Holland. Dutch religionists are very fanatic, and by their fanaticism and sanctimoniousness they turn the minds of upright and sincere people away from God and his truth. With these facts in mind, you, will be able to understand that pioneering by Jehovah’s witnesses is very necessary, but, too, extremely difficult. Therefore it has been and is nearly impossible in Holland for pioneers to keep in the service without help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We started by renting a home for a year in Amsterdam, accommodating nine pioneers, all of whom were then German brethren. This house was opened on November 1; and a 63-year-old sister, a member of the company residing there, was appointed to care for the household. During this year the city of Amsterdam has for the first time been thoroughly worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next a house boat was rented for half a year, where five or six brethren could be housed. The great advantage of this boat was that the brethren could pass quickly on from one town to another when finished, without losing valuable time in seeking new accommodation. On May 15 this was replaced by another pioneer home in the city of Groningen, in Northern Holland. On May 1 our third pioneer home was opened in the city of Tilburg, in the south of Holland (the entirely Catholic provinces). From this home, which accommodates ten pioneers, wonderful work has been done among the Catholic people of the more thickly populated southern districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The remaining territory is worked by individual pioneers, who are able to provide for themselves, and by sixty company workers. The regular number of pioneers was twenty-six, and ten auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We were able to place at the disposal of the pioneer homes three autocars, two seven-seaters and one five-seater, with which the pioneers are working districts within a sradius of 50 milesi By these means we are able to give the witness throughout the entire country of Holland once.each year. We see, from the results, that the oxcart with which the Dutch work has been carried on for many years has been replaced by automobiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Devil thought, to hinder the work in France by the expulsion of several pioneers, but he was wrong in this. The expelled pioneers went to Holland, and there Satan’s bulwarks were attacked as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet has proven to be a special encouragement for all of Jehovah’s witnesses here. The work of serving notice to the rulers is now completed. During the special </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> weeks we were working with an autocar equipped to advertise the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets. A loudspeaker was fixed on it, and attractive music was provided to draw the attention of the people to the message. Splendid results were obtained by means of this car, especially where many people could be assembled, the brethren working round the car placing the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year we arranged in different parts of the country regional service conventions, which were well attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the office we have been busy translating the books and booklets, which flow like a stream of truth from headquarters over the earth. Soon we shall have for distribution seven bound books, in addition to the many booklets. During the year 1,159 pieces of mail were received and 477 pieces were dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">BADIO: At the beginning of the kingdom campaign the General Broadcasting Association (A.V.B.O.) afforded us the opportunity of using their station for nearly half an hour, when the lecture, “The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,” was broadcast. Many intellectual people wrote to the office for a copy of the lecture, and the workers were helped very much by it in placing the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord is looking after the interests of his woik, but we are acquainted also with the fact that Satan by his chief prince Gog is doing everything in his power to stop the work here. This he is trying to do by customs difficulties, by a new law forbidding anyone to go from house to house on Sunday (we- have a “Christian” government), and by a new law against ‘blaspheming’ god (Satan)! We have confidence, however, that the Lord will show us ways and means to carry on the work to the vindication of His word and name. He will maintain the work of his hands to his own glory, and Satan and his cohorts will be put to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This report from Holland is indeed gratifying. It shows that the Lord will have his witness given in every land where his name has been particularly defamed. All shall know that Jehovah is God!,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark244"></a><span class="font9">Hungary, as is well known, for many years has been under the domination of the papal system. Darkness covers that land, and gross darkness the mass of the people. Those who make an effort to get out from under the influence of the papacy receive much persecution. Amidst all the opposition Jehovah’s witnesses have gone forward in giving the testimony. During the year the corporate charter of the Society was registered there, which has furnished some advantage in defending ourselves against the enemy. The literature placed in Hungary during the year totals 1,276 bound books and 135,832 booklets. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the year constantly lookout was held for greater possibilities to give a strong witness for Jehovah’s kingdom. Hungary is a country wholly subject to the influence of clericalism, and its population is unable to get rid of this influence. Jehovah’s witnesses were persecuted everywhere, and nobody was able to remain in full-time service. Therefore no pioneers and auxiliary pioneers were active. But the friends throughout the country watched every possibility to serve the Lord. When the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet appeared, this was made a special occasion to give the capital of Hungary an extensive witness. At a fixed time 90 German friends went there, and in the course of five days about 125,000 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets and 200,000 tracts were spread. Many people were made glad with the message of the truth, and many letters received are showing how many they are that long for the kingdom. The rage of the enemy was greatly aroused, but he was unable to hurt even one of Jehovah’s witnesses. During the year the Society has been registered, and now a small office is maintained at Budapest. By special efforts the brethren were able to get the two books </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Eeconciliation</span><span class="font8"> printed in the country proper, so that in the coming year more possibility will exist to proclaim the kingdom in a marked degree. In spite of all efforts of the enemy, his wrath was kept back by Jehovah’s mighty hand; and there is much evidence that Jehovah will still have a great work to his glory done in this dark country. Though no public lectures and similar undertakings were permitted, it is interesting to note how everywhere, in spite of the interdiction by police, the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses are attended by many people, and some enter the ranks of those on Jehovah’s side. Many oppressed people there wait for the kingdom. During the year the totals of distribution were as follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In the cold and bleak land of Iceland there are warm-hearted and zealous ones for the Lord, appreciating the fact that Jehovah made all mankind of one blood and in due time will give all mankind an opportunity to know the truth. Under very great difficulties some of these faithful brethren have carried the message into Iceland; and it will be of real interest to note the results during the year. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sometimes -our only pioneer in -die far-away island has to do real pioneer work traveling over vast areas only sparsely populated and the number of books placed will then be not so big, but taking into consideration circumstances, the figures are very encouraging</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark263"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">For many centuries the peoples of India have been held in darkness by Jehovah’s enemy; but now the light is breaking through, so that those who have charge of the affairs in India on the enemy’s side will not be able to say they had no notice of the approaching kingdom nor information that Jehovah is God. The work is progressing, and the zeal of God’s people there is evidence that these are anointed by him and determined to press the battle at the gate. From the local manager’s report at India, the following is extracted :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a pleasure once again to submit a general report of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in India, Burma and Ceylon for the year just closed. The report covers eleven months only, because of the need to prepare it in time for you to receive it during October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a blessed privilege to be permitted to serve the great Jehovah God, and we in India have special cause for gratitude in this respect. There has been a healthy increase of activity all round, as was to be expected, and for this we give praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We were favored at the beginning of the period under review to have three new pioneers out from England, making a total now of eight. There is no desire to differentiate between Englishmen and Indians; but so long as others recognize a distinction, just so long will the work of witnessing to Englishmen in India be possible only to English workers. It is found also that a white man has a far better chance of access to the influential people of the land than has a native Indian, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">far this reason the results in output of literature are far </span><span class="font8">greater with English workers than with Indian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A year ago there were practically no “company” workers in the whole ef this field. It is most encouraging now to see newly interested ones coming forward into activity for the name of Jehovah, whilst “Memorial saints” continue to love one’another rather than demonstrate that they love Jehovah; which is particularly noticeable in Burma and Ceylon. Eor the first time it is now possible to report regular activity on the part of “company” workers in Burma and Ceylon, and it is hoped that this small beg</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">inn</span><span class="font8">ing will soon grow to larger proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total distribution of literature for the eleven months under review is 63,746, of which 80 percent was put out by 20 pioneers. The following table will show at a glance how this figure is composed!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">An analysis of the reported results shows that the pioneers averaged 3.7 testimonies per hour, 47 percent of which were to obtainers, whilst the company workers made an average of 32 percent to obtainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">SPF.C</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">TAT,</span><span class="font8"> CAMPAIGNS: The work with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font8">booklet stands in a category by itsdf. The distribution of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet was taken up with enthusiasm. Of 7,320 English and 14,603 vernacular copies which have been disposed of, 2,468 are reported as having gone into the hands of the rulers. The work of getting this booklet to all the elergy is a difficult one with so few workers, and it is not completed yet. We intended to send a large number through the post, but no up-to-date directory of addresses could be procured. The viceroy and all provincial governors and their staffs were served with a copy, as well as all high officials on the civil list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom,</span><span class="font8"> booklet has been published in Malayalam, Tamil, Urdu, </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hin</span><span class="font8">di, Sinhalese and Gujerati,. and the Burmese translation is now being made. Some of these have been supplied also to other branches of the Society in whose countries Indians are resident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work opened up some time ago among the Indian Christians in the Punjab is increasing, though not to a very large extent. There are a few zealous workers there, and certainly many whose eyes are opened to the truth but who through fear have not yet made a definite stand. The same may be said of the work in Travancore, in South India. Here, of course, the work is much more advanced; but Indians in general live in such hopeless conditions of poverty, and this, coupled with long years of servitude and an enervating climate, seems to have broken their spirit and weakened their ability to stand against their oppressors. Only the kingdom can deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Ceylon the work has progressed apace. Ceylon is a country with few large towns and many tea and other estates. Boads are very good and two pioneers on motorcycles have been witnessing to these scattered planters. One pioneer sister has labored alone chiefly in the smaller towns and villages. There is also a definite and regular activity now on the part of some more recently interested people, one of whom has lately entered the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prospect for the coming year with three new books and thirteen booklets to offer the people is thrilling, to say the very least of it. There is surely no time now for anything but kingdom service, and as Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the earth we are determined to &quot;eat up” all that the Lord provides for us and with boldness deliver the message thus put into our mouths. As the perplexity of the nations increases, the more do we long to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark265"></a><span class="font9">Italy has long been dominated by the papal influence, so far as Biblical matters are concerned. It has been very difficult to get any witness work done in Italy for some time; but during the fiscal year just closed an effort was put forth, with the result that about 325,000 copies of literature were placed in Italy. The following is copied from the report made by the Society’s representative for Italy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During this year, according to the order of the president of the Society, a special attack was made against the Devil’s stronghold in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If literature in large quantities had been shipped into Italy, the enemy would have been aroused and would have interfered. Thus a careful plan was made, and a small number of brethren were asked to cooperate in a special drive for the distribution of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The distribution had to be done very quickly. Twenty brethren of Switzerland went into Italy, and they talked about the weather and other things while in the train. With the help of newspaper agencies and Italian boys packages were wrapped up and shipped during the night as newspapers to all the larger cities of northern Italy. The brethren took -the same trains and found the literature ready as they reached their destinations in the morning. In some cities the police gave verbal permission, to proceed with the work, and within ten days 300,000 copies of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet had been distributed. In the middle of the week the enemy was aroused, and upon the order from Rome the permission to distribute was withdrawn. Brother Harbeck, as representative of the Society, appeared before the authorities at Milan and at Rome, and these men also received a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In fact some of the police authorities were ordered to study the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet carefully. The Italian Government has now promised to examine the books, and it is expected that they will act upon their own law, which guarantees religious liberty. One high official said that the Italian Government looks upon our work favorably, but it cannot acknowledge us outwardly, because the Government is bound by the treaty with the Vatican. The same high official said, however, that the treaty between Mussolini and the pope was not a very close alliance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Apart from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets distributed as above mentioned, 895 books and 1,600 booklets were placed with the people during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The small island of Jamaica is the temporary dwelling place of some of Jehovah’s witnesses who are zealously taking the message of the kingdom to the people. The work there has increased during the year, to the joy of those who have participated in it, in which joy the brethren throughout the earth, will participate also. The following is extracted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We are </span><span class="font8">very thankful to our dear heavenly Father for having used us another year in this blessed ministry. It is with much gratitude that we review the assistance, in every direction, that we received from the head office during the past. We are amazed, but delighted, at the items of information which eame to us during the year now closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year 1932 is a memorable year to the Jamaica branch. The adversary had been using subtle means as never before, to interfere with the work here; but just then the Society sent us Brother George Young, whose visit brought untold blessings. He caused all to realize more fully their privilege and responsibility. Thousands listened to Brother Young’s lecture, and much interest was aroused all over the island. Some of the preachers got angry and wrote very bitter things, but such actions only caused the people to ask for more lectures. The demand for more lectures was more than we were able to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The regional service directors had been very active, and their services were much appreciated all over the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pioneers are to be found in every part of the island and are doing all they can to make placements of the Society’s literature for the good of the people. We had the pleasure of sending a pioneer to the Cayman islands, where the hell-fire doctrine is held sacred. The preachers tried to oppose the witness work, but many of the people were supplied with our literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The company of Jehovah’s witnesses are very active in the work, and new companies are being formed with the same desire to be active in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of the general financial depression our placements of literature have much exceeded those of last year. Our joys increase as we go forth proclaiming the message of the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font8">gdom. We beheve that much is left to be done ere Armageddon approaches, and are determined to do our part in announcing the approaching destruction and the blessings of the kingdom to follow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Anyone who is really devoted to the Lord and who witnesses the forward march of the kingdom message in the various parts of the earth can have no doubt as to the truth which the Society is now proclaiming by the grace of the Lord. Everywhere ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ is breaking down, and everywhere the tide of truth continues to rise. In far-away Japan the work has had a healthy increase during the year, and those participating in it are thrilled with the prospect of having part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The work in Korea has been placed under the supervision of the Society’s office at Tokyo, Japan, and it is now in a more healthy condition. From the Society’s local manager’s report the following excerpts are quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another glorious year has passed with much the highest record for the witness work which has been done to the name and word of the Most High. It was still the best record since the work began in Japan. In spite of very bad conditions in every way here in Japan, the Lord has richly blessed his anointed with more work to do for his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PUBLIC WITNESS IN FORMOSA ISLAND: We had three great public meetings in the island of Formosa during the month of May. The gospel of the kingdom is thoroughly witnessed to the three million of Formosans and Japanese there through these meetings and a great many books. Two Japanese pioneer brethren placed more than 1,300 books and booklets in a week. One Formosan young man is already in the pioneer service, and some more are coming into the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">KINGDOM</span><span class="font8"> BOOKLET PERIOD: The shipment of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet in Japanese arrived here in May. Two entire months, June and July, were devoted as the special distribution period of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. During the period we had placed 42,624 of the booklets and 34,878 of Japanese </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> in the hands of 6,347 of the ruling class and 36,277 of the common people. The booklet was placed among officials of the highest class and even the royal family in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">CONVENTION: The second All-Japan service convention was held in Tokyo for three days, from May 20 to 22, inclusive. Nifty-eight were present, and fifty-five went to field service. There were 1,480 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklets placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TANKS: In Japan it is very expensive to have an automobile. The roads in the country district are very bad. At the same time we do not need to have an automobile, because we can reach the next village within an hour. So we decided to build “tanks” without an engine. Three “tanks” will be built, and one of them is nearly completed. Each “tank” has three man power, not horse power, on foot; and is eight feet in length, four feet and one-half in width, and six feet high. In this car three pioneer brethren can sleep, study, eat, cook, and meet. Now any remote district can be reached by these tanks. It is built with iron pipes and sheets. Entire cost of each tank is less than $30. All the building of these is done by the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ACTIVITY: The activity of the witness work in Japan was greatly increased during last year. It is very strange that there is only one company in the whole of Japan. Whoever gets the knowledge of the truth and has the zeal for the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font8">gdom, he or she jumps into the pioneer service immediately. So in Japan regional service directors go around to visit the pioneers, and not the companies as they do in America or European countries. The number of pioneers increased 14 more than in the previous year. During the last year 1,068,471 testimonies were given, an increase of 328,369 over the previous year. The placement of bound books totaled 14,361, or decreased by 666. The booklets totaled 111,044, or increased by 13,940. Japanese </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> totaled 6,889, or increased by 1,904. Japanese </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> totaled 247,260, or increased by 134,859.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">RESULT: The result of the activity in Japan during the year of 1932 is as follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark269"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Many difficulties have been encountered in Korea in the fiscal year closed as well as in times past, but the work in that isolated country is again taking on some real activity. We hope for better results next year. The following is taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We held our first convention in Seoul, June 11-13, under the leadership of our dear Brother Akashi, and 45 were in attendance from everywhere. During the convention 582 booklets of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> and some books were left in the hands of the rulers and people in Seoul. It was a sweet time of refreshing from the hand of the Lord and was a stimulus and encouragement to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We rejoice that so many books and booklets have been printed in the Korean language, and we hope soon to be able to make a wider distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, gladly, we sent this annual report to you, as follows:</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark272"><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> free</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font8">On September 28, 50,000 copies of the warning contained in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet were issued in the Korean language for free distribution.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark273"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Latvia is another benighted country. The condition there is well expressed in the language of the local representative of the Society, from which the following is quoted s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Latvia have been able to complete another happy year in the kingdom service. A few years ago the Haman class succeeded in getting restrictions placed upon our supplies of new books; but the few thousands we had at that time have, like the widow’s pot of oil in Elisha’s day, continued to flow out like a never-ending stream. God’s faithful people have found that his arm is not shortened. Several interesting experiences could be told proving most unmistakably the presence of the angels in Zion and of their protection and care for the interests of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great event of the year has been the receiving of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. It is several years since a new booklet in the Latvian language was issued, and the distribution of this one has been a source of considerable encouragement to the friends. Supplies were first received in June, and by the end of September more than 11,000 had been spread among the people. Many expressions of appreciation have been received from those who have read the message contained in the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total number of books and booklets sent out during the year was 29,296. Of these, four companies, ranging in numbers from 7 to 16, spread 9,741, which flgure shows a healthy increase compared with the number distributed by the companies last year; while an average of 4 pioneers and 3 auxiliaries spread 15,602. The number of those engaged in the pioneer service is small, and some of these are not physically strong. Winters are long and sometimes cold, and the roads are often not good. In addition there are often </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font8">culties to be met on account of the restrictions previously referred to. Many of the people, while professing Christianity, still believe in their pagan gods and practice old rites and ceremonies. Despite everything, however, the work still continues and will go on. The prospects for the year just commencing are brighter than were those of a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the course of the year two conventions were held, with a total attendance of 80. The brethren responded well to the call to service, and some participated therein for the first time and have continued in the work ever since. All the addresses were taken from recent </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font8"> and had the effect of energizing the brethren for the days ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Latvia has not escaped the general depression which is affecting practically the whole world. The financial condition of the country is veiy bad and is made worse by corruption which is rife. As a result of increased tariffs and quotas the farmers are unable to sell their produce, and this reacts upon business generally, for the prosperity of the country depends upon its agriculture. In the towns there is much unemployment, and of those who have retained their situations very many have had their salaries reduced by as much as 33 percent. The effect of these conditions upon our work is twofold. Some, not having so much money as formerly, are less inclined to take the literature when it is offered; while others, seeing the hopeless condition of affairs generally, are more ready to lend an ear to the message of the kingdom, and see in it that which gives them hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people are more docile and suffer hard conditions longer than some of the peoples of the western nations might be inclined to do. For centuries they were in a condition of serfdom which in some respects was worse than slavery. Now, although in many things there is less freedom than formerly under the old Russian regime, the people seem more ready to submit, for the reason that the hardships now to be borne come at a time when they are under the rulership of those of their own nation. We rejoice in the privilege of telling the people that the rulership of Jehovah’s anointed King will satisfy the desire o.f every living thing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark275"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark276"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">One cannot consider the conditions existing amongst the nations of earth without clearly seeing that there is no hope of relief except God’s kingdom, and happy are the people of the Lord that his kingdom is here and soon mankind will be relieved of oppressors. This is not the happiest part, however. The time has come to know Jehovah God and to learn of his goodness and for the people to receive the blessings he has in store for them that love and serve Him. Lithuania, like other countries, is much in need of Jehovah’s kingdom. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lithuania, in common with other- countries, has been and is affected by the world crisis. During the summer months there is usually little unemployment in the capital, but this year many have been glad to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the local authorities, of working a few hours each day on the roads and earning 2 lits (20 American cents) per day. Such a sum is insufficient for one person to provide the necessities of life. Farm produce is sold at prices leaving practically no margin for profit, wages have been considerably reduced all round, and conditions generally are such that rulers and ruled are facing the coming winter with trepidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is therefore very encouraging to be able to report an increase of more than 122 percent over last year’s figures, the actual total being 37,950 books and booklets, as against 17,043 for the preceding year. Truly the Lord has blessed the efforts of his witnesses here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gog has his forces well to the fore, Lithuania being virtually under a military dictatorship, although that is not generally admitted. But under the protection of Jehovah through his angels, his witnesses have been able to go boldly forward with confidence. Many of the military leaders and all of the ‘higher-ups’ whose names and addresses were available were served with the warning from Jehovah as set forth in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet. Some of these have, on reading the message, sent to the office for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The activities of the pioneers have helped considerably in the accomplishment of the above-mentioned results. In Memelge-biet one pioneer has given a good account of himself, causing the clergy on more than one occasion to report him to the police. When brought to the police office, he gave a faithful witness, not merely by word of mouth, but by leaving literature in the hands of the officers. In Lithuania there have been two native pioneers, and three sent from England under your direction just over a year ago. The latter very quickly learnt sufficient of the language to make themselves understood, and very soon the religious papers were writing against them. Unfortunately for the Lithuanian work, much of their time has been occupied in connection with work in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accommodation, even in the so-called ‘towns’, is frequently difficult to obtain, and a bed free from vermin seems to be the exception rather than the rule. The provision of suitable food is often a problem. Cycling, which can be a pleasure in countries like England, is usually hard labor in this land. A shower of rain frequently makes the roads impassable. Only a keen desire to honor the name of Jehovah has enabled the pioneers to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The zeal manifested by Jehovah’s witnesses in meeting the hardships encountered in the service in these benighted countries is a real stimulus to others more favorably situated. To be sure, Jehovah knows all about these difficulties, and he permits his witnesses to encounter them and, by his grace, to overcomethem. Let all the witnesses everywhere be encouraged as they mark the hand of the Lord in surmounting the difficult things that arise in the pathway of his witnesses. The local manager of Lithuania further reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A convention was held in the small town of Radviliskis. The largest number attending a meeting was 45, but only 18 of these appreciated the real purpose of the convention and took part in the effort to honor Jehovah’s name. This little party spread 137 books and booklets in a few neighboring villages and in the town itself, where the message is fairly well known. Comfortable bedding was provided by heaps of sweet-smelling hay strewn on the floor of a disused hall. Although accommodation was rather primitive, the workers enjoyed a very happy time together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Memelgebiet the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses continue to show that they appreciate the importance of their new name. In so far as the people in this district have been accustomed to a higher standard, of living, conditions may be said to be worse than in greater Lithuania. Nevertheless results have been better than during the previous year. Although the number of workers is the same, there has been a slight increase in the average out each week and in the time spent in the work, which is a very important factor. The average number of books spread per hour has been good, but the number of hours per worker could be improved upon. The publication of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font8"> and the first volume of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vvndtoation</span><span class="font8"> in a cheaper binding has enabled a greater number of these books to be spread. Wild speculations concerning certain dates, by those who are no longer with us, has caused much prejudice in Memelgebiet, but the persistent presentation of the message of the kingdom is gradually breaking down this prejudice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three one-day service conventions were held at TJszloknen. On each, -occasion a journey by motor bus was made from Memel, friends being picked up en route and distributed when the territory was reached, at about 8: 00 a.m. Witnessing continued until 1: 00 p.m., when the workers were conveyed to a farm for refreshment of mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In January the Photo-Drama of Creation was shown in the town of Memel to capacity audiences on each of the three evenings. A total attendance of 3,250 was reported, and 740 books were distributed amongst those present. Much difficulty was experienced right up to the last moment in obtaining permission for the apparatus to be brought over the border, as well as for the Drama to be exhibited. All who signified their interest by leaving their names were invited to a series of five lectures a month later. These were also well attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The various special service periods are particularly helpful and are always an incentive to greater efforts. They also enable us to feel more keenly the wonderful unity which exists at this time among the witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The friends here desire me to convey to you their warm love and appreciation, which I have much pleasure in doing, as-sunng you at the same time of my own love and of my gratitude to Jehovah foi the lead he is giving to his people through you at this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark277"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">It has been very difficult to get the work started in Luxemburg, because of the opposition by the clergy. However, the witness work has been carried on there this year, and some are beginning to learn that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand. This small country is under the immediate supervision of Germany, and drom the manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same measure that this country is small, the difficulties are great which stand against the message of the kingdom. The best of efforts were made to give a strong testimony, and in various places public lectures were held and the Drama of Creation shown. But the enemy made some such arrangements impossible and used the clergy, and this in turn the press, to spread slanders and reproaches of Jehovah and his Word, when they could not stop matters. Since some time a small number of Jehovah’s witnesses are in this country. The Devil by agency of his instruments, however, tries time and again to bring them before the court, and one after the other three pioneers were banished from the country, after many legal actions taken against them. Only one sister continues her work as a pioneer, as well as possibilities afford. In four places small companies of interested people have been brought together tins year, and they are visited by a brother from Germany. Some of these friends took their stand wholly on Jehovah’s side and are eagerly busy for the kingdom. Though pioneers for the time being can do only little work, it is to be expected that the few company workers will continue to give a good testimony. During the year the following was spread:</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark281"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The kingdom work in Norway continues to move forward, thus giving proof that the Lord’s blessing is upon it and that his people there are pleasing to him. There was a great increase in the distribution of literature during the year, notwithstanding the efforts of the enemy. It is a pleasure to quote from the Society’s local representative the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have just now finished our year convention, September 17-20, a happy time with great encouraging to all the friends. We never before had so many friends from the farther places in Norway. From Bergen came two automobiles with 18 friends. They had to drive 960 miles the difficult ways over the mountains. One place they had to put the cars on ship over a fjord for four hours. Also from Knstiansand a car with 8 friends, driving 720 miles. A pioneer brother tramped on his bicycle 816 miles. Eighty-four went out twice and spread 2,171 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are indeed in the most wonderful time, and are thankful for the bright shining light Jehovah gives us. But we feel also it is the most serious time. The work is going forward also in Norway. We get more and more to do, and very often a lot, because Gog is after the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The economic difficulties have been harder this year, but the result is that we get out more books. The friends are zealous and happy in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A time ago the Norwegian Government got a new commercial law. The Devil is using this to give us a lot of troubles, but the work of the clergy and the police is acting as a good advertisement for us. The police have several times forbidden our pioneers to spread books without license for them. Those police have sent report to the head office in Oslo, that again have sent a policeman to me, asking how I dare to give the pioneers permission to spread books, as the police only have this authority. I told them that we have our authority from the great God Jehovah, and we must give the witness to the people. But the head police has never done anything more with it. We have both told and written to them that they have to look after that the clergy and other fanatics don’t make troubles for our pioneers. We have, as you know, 4 English pioneers, who are doing a very good work. The police has also been after them, so they have had to move from place to place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We enjoyed the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> period. Never has a booklet campaign had such a powerful effect. We had many wonderful experiences. Our English pioneers, Brother and Sister Hollis, were in Trondheim. But the police forbade them to spread it. Then they bought several thousands from the office and gave </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> to the people. The police forbade them also to give them away, but then it was nearly done. Brother Dey wrote to the police that “our whole Trondheim’s stock of several thousands of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> have now been distributed among the people there’’ and “that King Hakon granted an audience to our Norwegian representative and he gladly received copies of our literature and chatted our matters for about twenty minutes’’. Then the Trondheim police sent Brother Hollis a card saying that it was a misunderstanding and that they could give literature away if they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are very thankful for the new boat. The providing and start with the three pioneers was all right. They have reached people that never can get the message in another way. They had a good spreading of the literature. But Satan found out that this was not good for his organization, and when the brethren started for the convention and came in open sea, they got some difficulties with the motor in a storm. The west coast in. Norway is one of the most hard in storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are very thankful to Jehovah for being able to put out more literature this year than last year. From the office we have sent out a total of 146,809 books and booklets, 5,250 Bulletins and 1,561 letters. There have been 98 friends in the service work, and 20 pioneers. Average number each week, 86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> has 5,157 subscribers, 1,629 more than last year; 18,350 single copies have been spread. We get more and more encouraging proofs how </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> is doing a fine work for the truth, especially as we have not yet been permitted to use the radio here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In every part of “Christendom” the prophetic utterances of the Lord, recorded centuries ago in the Holy Scriptures, are being fulfilled. Wherever the priests or clergy have had the greatest power, there is the greatest amount of darkness and there Satan uses his various agencies to attempt to hinder God’s kingdom work more than elsewhere. Poland is one of these places. The number there who are really consecrated to the Lord is small, and out of all the number there only about 600 are engaged in the actual field service. One of the well known newspapers of Warsaw recently published a statement to this effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Bible Students in Poland could hardly number more than 600,000, and of this small number there appears to be so much agitation as is not observed in re any other religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The enemy thus shows its fright, and truly ‘one chases a thousand’. The faithful and zealous ones are not at all discouraged, but are pushing forward with the work, notwithstanding the persecution,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The wrath of the enemy has never been expressed in a more pointed manner than during the past year. For seventeen months cases have been before the courts, in which Jehovah’s witnesses have been charged with communism. Some of these have spent as much as seven months in prison. The clergy have been back of this persecution and have attempted to bring material evidence into the court to prove the ‘guilt’ of the defendants, but have failed to do so. The proceedings have recently been abandoned for lack of proof. The literature of the Society that was heretofore confiscated has been returned to its rightful owner. The clergy now publish in their own papers that all their efforts with the authorities against Jehovah’s witnesses have failed and now there remains nothing for them to do but to take matters in their own hands. This they are doing. Recently in one city where the Catholics were holding a meeting the priest commanded all to bring their books and these were, amidst a solemn ceremony, burned in the public city square. Other instances are reported where the priests and their hoodlum agents have attacked pioneers and robbed them and burned their literature in the streets. These priests not only have mistreated and caused Jehovah’s witnesses to be robbed, but have called upon the people to kill them. Thus far the Lord has protected them from such assaults. The work done during the year is interesting, and for this the Lord’s people rejoice. During the year the distribution amongst the people was as follows: Books, 14,143; booklets, 163,362; making a total of 177,505 books and booklets. Bibles to the number of 2,101 have been placed with the people, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> to the number of 87,445. Thus the work has progressed in spite of the efforts of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year the Society purchased a home for the interests of the witnesses at headquarters. This property is situated at Lodz, and those who are there looking after the work have a comfortable place to reside and carry on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are 3 regional service directors in Poland, who during the year have held 686 service meetings, attended by 18,119, and in addition to this have held 188 public lectures, with a total attendance of 36,204.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The work in Portugal progresses under many handicaps. During the year there was distributed in Portugal the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet in paper form to the number of 260,000. Other books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people, to the number of 4,165, making the total distribution 264,165. There is only one pioneer in the field, and the rest of the work must be done by brethren who have to put in part of their time at other things. There is some interest manifested by the people of Portugal. The correspondence department of the work during the year received 780 letters and dispatched 858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RUMANIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font9">Rumania has been one of the countries where much persecution has been suffered by Jehovah’s witnesses, but this has not dampened their zeal for the Lord. Many have been arrested and thrown into prison, and when they got out they went on with the service again. During the year just closed Jehovah’s witnesses in Rumania have become better organized, and 1,866 workers have engaged in the service. Pioneer service is also being done now in Rumania, even though it is done under difficulties. Many Catholic priests occupy governmental positions, and these use their power and influence to hinder the work. Together with those who have become traitors to the Lord’s service, Satan has organized a formidable force against God’s people. The Rumanian consul has recently made an investigation and reported to the Rumanian Government. The Rumanian Government answered that report and stated in substance that the Government understands that Jehovah’s witnesses are not communists but that our literature contains the statement that the present world organization is of the Devil and that therefore it is being taught indirectly that the Rumanian Government is also a part of the Devil’s world; that the Rumanian Government does not believe that this great change is about to take place and that the dead will be resurrected; that if the Rumanian Government could believe that God’s kingdom is to be set up within a few years from now and the resurrection of the dead take place, the Government would not only permit the proclamation of the message, but would assist in doing so. The Government has received sufficient information, however, to be put on notice that this is God’s message of his kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses are therefore doing their duty in serving the notice. The responsibility now rests upon the Rumanian authorities, and God will recompense them in accordance with their action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In some of the court cases the clergy are able to influence the court, and yet the court often decided the case in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. A Rumanian newspaper, reporting the acquittal of some of these witnesses, stated that the faith and love of Jehovah’s witnesses exceeds that of others and these witnesses are more trustworthy than other men. It is gratifying to see the determination of our dear brethren in Rumania to press on in giving the testimony, notwithstanding the great opposition. It is with pleasure that this report announces that during the year the faithful witnesses, including the company workers and the pioneers, placed in the hands of the people 55,632 books and booklets, in addition to a number of Bibles.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark287"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark288"></a>SARRE BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">By the terms of the Versailles Treaty the Sarre Basin was taken from Germany and its population of nearly 800,000 people was placed under the administration of a commission of the League of Nations, thus putting it under the direct supervision of the ‘image of the beast’. In this territory there are 4 organized companies, -with 173 members, of whom 115 are regular workers. During the year 5,885 books and 43,773 booklets were placed in the hands of the people, and 4,348 copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> were distributed. The regular service periods have been responded to readily by the workers and with good results.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark289"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark290"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The work in Spain has met many reverses since beginning. Its population, long kept in ignorance of the Bible by reason of influence of the papal system, do not take readily to anything religious even though now they have been freed largely from the papal influence. The fiscal year just closed, however, has witnessed a wider circulation of the kingdom message than heretofore. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font9"> booklet was put in cheaper form, and 500,000 copies were placed in the hands of the people. All persons holding official positions in the government were served. In addition to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font9">booklet above mentioned, books and booklets to the number of 12,713 were placed in the hands of the people. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was a great encouragement to observe many months later how the people remembered having received this message even in some of the most remote villages. We are grateful to our brethren in other parts of the world for having shouldered the great financial burden entailed by this witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In every way, this lias been a year of great activity for all engaged in the work It is regretted that there are but few availing themselves of their privilege of service. On the other hand, those who have been active have had both increased joy and strength from the Lord and have warmly appreciated the rich food which has come to us through the columns of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One gentleman who has known the truth for barely six months has been faithfully giving a witness to all his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The other flay he had occasion to speak to the<sup>1</sup> finance minister 'and found that he knew all about our message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three months ago, three pioneer brothers came out from England, and they have been working in the north of Spain, in the province of Biscay, which is reputedly one of the most Catholic parts of the country. Although two of them had no knowledge at all of the language, their party managed to place during these three months 459 books, 1,032 booklets, and 509 loose copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad,</span><span class="font8"> apart from taking a few sub* scriptions. This is probably a record for Spain; and, bearing in mind the inherent difficulties of the country, viz., the superstition and darkness of the masses, the high percentage of illiteracy of the people, the general ignorance of the Bible, etc., one cannot but feel that the Lord alone could have enabled these brethren to accomplish so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Naturally, we are not free from opposition. However, this seems to be coming especially from the &quot;evil servant” class rather than from outside. The timely articles in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> have warned and armed us against these attacks, and, by the Lord’s grace, we in Spain, though few in number, are determined to continue to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conclusion I cannot but express my appreciation of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font8"> which the Lord has given us this year. The brethren are anxious to receive it in Spanish and meanwhile are receiving this food at &quot;second hand”, looking forward to the time when Jehovah’s name will be fully vindicated in the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark291"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark292"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord’s anointed will call to mind that a few years ago the service work was organized in Sweden after the brethren had incurred much opposition and difficulty. There has been a healthy increase in the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in Sweden during the year, and the result is gratifying. Books and booldets total 377,808. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year just past has meant a lot to the population of Sweden The business depression has set in as never before, helped along to a large degree by the downfall of the Kreuger concern And right at that time the witnesses of Jehovah sallied forth to give his warning and show the only way out' of the trouble, “The Kingdom, the hope of the world.” As already reported we had many very encouraging experiences in connection with this work. And some of the Jehonadab class, so clearly described in the Jehu articles, have made themselves manifest and have shown their appreciation by taking part in the work, particularly in connection with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font8">work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet is responsible, largely, for the increase both in output and placements we are grateful to be able to report for the year past. In output the increase is 71 percent on last year, the total number of books and booklets put out by the office being 335,544 copies. Besides books and booklets there have been placed a total number of 283,200 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> The subscribers for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> number 19,255.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet we have got during the past year the following new publications in our language: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font8">Book One and Book Two, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Life, Prophecy,</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities. Life</span><span class="font8"> came just in time for the July testimony period, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font8"> reached us immediately before the vacation period in the beginning of September. We are very grateful for the help these new publications afford us, and especially glad that they can be offered to the people at so low a contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The various periods of united publicity have proved a great blessing to us. As an example: During the July “Hour Period” there was placed, in that one week, more literature than during the whole month of July the previous year; and that in spite of the fact that it was awfully hot weather and a lot of people were out of their homes, so the witnesses had to pass many empty homes on their way from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all the divisions of the army operating in this country there is an increased number of active workers to report. The number of pioneers each month has gone up from 38 to 43, the total number from 43 to 52. Average number of auxiliaries has been 17 (same as last year) and total number 24, as against 21. The number of workers in the companies taking part in the witness work each week has been 244, as against 162, which is an increase of 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The number of testimonies given is reported as 515,119, which corresponds to one-twelfth of the population. To this comes the testimony given by means of public meetings, a limited number of which have been held by the regional service directors. Most of the time of these brethren has been used, however, in looking after the service work in the companies and giving the testimony from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The service conventions have proved a great blessing, though not great in number nor in attendance, owing to the long distances. Sometimes a convention has been arranged at a place where no friends live, and the companies and isolated workers have gathered there and given the witness to great advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In all the witness work the new name of the remnant, viz., Jehovah’s witnesses, has proved a great blessing, too. Some timid ones have gotten courage to appear before anyone since they got this name, they say, and the public often become, as one sister put it in a letter to this office, “rather respectful” when they hear this name; although many think we are presumptuous, and some do not at all know what “Jehovah” and ‘his witnesses’ mean. We are happy, however, to know that soon all shall know that the Most High is Jehovah and that his name is above all. We rejoice that the Greater Jehu is driving rapidly to the execution of all enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is with pleasure I am able to report that the Lord’s people in this country as a whole see eye to eye; and surely it is true that the angels in Zion put thoughts into the minds of the remnant, so that they all may appreciate the precious truths when these come to them in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and the books as answers to their questions and settling all difficulties. This has been manifested once more in the question of elders and deacons. The pillar of cloud has again directed a move out of a camp of accustomed thought and conditions, and all the remnant at once are alert and ready to follow its lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In closing I beg to express to you our united love and greetings of thankful appreciation for your untiring labor in Jehovah’s great cause. We desire to stand shoulder by shoulder with you in the fight unto the end I May the Lord graciously grant you and all of us the needed strength and blessing that we may battle courageously and sing his praises in a pleasing way according to his commandments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark293"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark294"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">As is well known, Switzerland is a small country and very mountainous. The population being so limited, doubtless this country has been worked often-er with the kingdom message than any other. The work this year in Switzerland shows splendid results. The local manager, concerning the work, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The police authorities in Switzerland have caused less trouble than formerly, but the clergy has sought in certain places, pai-ticularly where the Drama was exhibited, to cause damage to the work of the Lord. At Lucerne, a -tourist center of Switzerland,. the clergy -sent Catholic students to the exhibition of the Drama pictures to disturb the meeting by throwing stink bombs. Against such proceeding of the clergy the public protested; and the public asked the police to interfere and to expel the disturbers, and this was done. Thereupon the Haman class became more furious and raised a charge against the speaker, accusing him of blaspheming God. The lawsuit is still pending. We expect to fight it up to the highest court; and yet, if we are condemned as ‘blasphemers of God’, it will not prevent us from giving an even larger witness in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A year ago the cantonal government of the canton Gnsons made a law against the distribution of our literature. However, a fearless pioneer sister distributed some literature anyhow, with good success; but soon the police interfered, acting upon the orders of the Catholic bishop, and the sister had to leave that section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Socialist member of parliament and attorney has been charged to take up this case with the supreme court. This man told the chief man of that canton that the fight must prove whether the bishop of the canton of Grisons or the Swiss government at Bern is ruling Switzerland. Thus the battle continues, and the remnant shows the hard forehead and the lion’s teeth against the Devil and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bern office maintains 3 regional service directors and sends out 29 brethren from the office to serve the companies; and thus in our territory 13 regional service conventions weie held, with 2,240 attendants, 427 company gatheiings, with 7,600 attendants, and 96 public lectures, with 41,659 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Books placed in the hands of the people during the year total 34,753, and booklets, 260,224.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark295"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In Syria the work has not made great progress during the year. Still the consecrated there have .made an effort to carry the message to the people and have had a measure of success in this regard. Recently a brother went from America and is getting the work started on a better basis in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark297"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The consecrated in Trinidad have been greatly refreshed and enthused by the revelations of the prophecies that have appeared from the temple of Jehovah during the past year and been given to his people by his chosen means on earth. This has encouraged them, though small in numbers, to push forward and do their best in the work of giving testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. The following extract is taken from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is my pleasure to make report for the year just past of the Trinidad office which looks after the interests of the work in the lower group of the British West Indian (B.W.L) islands, the workers now operating in the islands of Trinidad, Barbados, Grenada, St. Vincent and Tobago; and this report proves their appreciation of their privileges for the quantities of books and booklets sent out; as well the number of workers, hours and testimonies in each case is the largest in the history of this office.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark305"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark306"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year there has been increased activity in Yugoslavia, and this increased activity there has drawn all the enemy’s fury upon Jehovah’s witnesses. The poor people who have received the message have received it with tears of joy. The following is quoted from the report from Yugoslavia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The economic crisis is felt here very strongly, because the country depends largely upon agriculture. It has been harder lately to place books, but we thank the Lord that we may lift np the banner of the truth in spite of the crisis. We are thankful that the Lord has given us five pioneers, and we expect further. helpers, because in this big land there are but few workers. We are also grateful that it was possible to have a few public lectures in the larger cities of Yugoslavia, whereby other workers will be found. The witnesses of Jehovah in this land will strive to glorify the name of Jehovah with even greater devotion and to stand faithfully on his side in the battle until the complete victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here are now nine small companies, three of which are organized for service. There were 127 brethren baptized; and 30 of these participate regularly as company workers. Most of the brethren are farm hands and they are able to work only in the winter time, because they are held down by their work in the summer time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1931, 1,968 books and 10,773 booklets were distributed. In this year 3,476 books and 28,494 booklets were put out. This shows an increase of 1,508 books and 17,721 booklets above the output of 1931. In other words, an increase of 77 percent on books and 164 percent on booklets; and the companies placed 2,300 books and 20,031 booklets. We also had one regional service convention, at which 56 workers distributed 30 books and 400 booklets in 114 hours of service. The sei vice weeks were also greatly blessed by the Lord. There were 104</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">meetings held, with approximately 5,359 visitors. Pieces of mail received were 507, and 526 pieces were dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We rejoice with our brethren in the land of Yugoslavia that the Lord permits them to have a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark307"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark308"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated. All shall know that Jehovah is God. Such is the thought uppermost in the mind of each one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of course the faithful have hope that they shall see the Lord and be for ever in his service, but that which is immediately claiming their attention is the work the Lord has now given them to do, to wit, to bear the message of his kingdom to the people, singing forth Jehovah’s praises, and notifying the rulers and the ruled that Jehovah is the Supreme One and that his kingdom is at hand. To this end Jehovah’s witnesses on earth work in exact unity and harmony. The number in this witness company is small, and to the rulers of this world seem to be very insignificant. In themselves these witnesses are weak, but they are strong in the Lord, giving glory to the Most High. By his grace the distribution during the year 1932 of books and booklets announcing the kingdom, and which have been written and published during the past decade, at the close of this fiscal year (1932) totaled 22,213,639.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The publications of the Society, and designated “Jr” books, which have been written and published during the past ten years, have now reached a total of upward of 130 million copies. If we would figure three persons to each copy that has gone out, that would be equivalent to 390 million persons that have had a chance to receive the truth. The census bureau figures five persons to each family. However, it is not so important as to the number that have been distributed, but how much advertisement has been given to the great Jehovah God, his kingdom, and his beloved Son the King. Happy are we that we can have any part in making these great truths known to the peoples of earth. In 1922 the slogan went forth, “ADVERTISE THE KING AND KINGDOM.” The Lord has done this very thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All honor and praise is due to our God and to his King. It is our privilege to sing forth his praises. How long will it now be until the great battle of the great day of God Almighty and the fall of Satan’s organization? That question cannot be answered, because the Scriptures do not disclose the answer. Whether it be but a few days or a long while is of very small importance. The testimony work is in progress, and Jehovah’s witnesses will continue their work of proclaiming his name and his kingdom in obedience to his commandment, “until the cities [meaning every part and division of Satan’s organization] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.”—Isa. 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems certain from the Scriptures that some of these faithful witnesses while in the flesh will see the great battle, and the desolation of Satan’s organization, and will meet the princes of the earth before reconstruction begins. Blessed is the man who is now permitted to be in the servant class of the Most High and who faithfully does his duty. With deep gratitude and thankfulness to Jehovah and his beloved King this report is respectfully submitted.</span></p><img src="yb1933_E_files/yb1933_E-4.png" alt="" style="width:73pt;height:27pt;">

<h1><a name="bookmark309"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark310"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">The annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the corporation, was held as provided by law and the charter at Pittsburgh, N.S., Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, on the 31st day of October, 1932, at 10 o’clock a.m. The meeting was presided over by C. A. Wise, the vice-president. The annual report made by the president was ordered printed in the Year </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following persons were elected as officers of the corporation, to hold office for a period of three years and until their successors are elected:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">President, J. F. Rutherford Vice-President, C. A. Wise Secretary and Treasurer, W. E. Van Amburgh</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark311"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark312"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 18:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J</span><span class="font10">EHOVAH has taken out from the world a people for his name and now in the hour of their great danger he provides the needed protection. Each one of his “servant” class must have a perfect heart condition toward Jehovah, that is to say, a heart that is entirely set upon doing God's will.—2 Chron. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1914 Jehovah placed his Son upon his throne and sent him forth to rule and to put down the enemy. Satan then learned that his time was short, and therefore he was very angry and set about to turn all creation against Jehovah God. To this end he plunged the nations into the great World War, and in malice would have caused all peoples to literally destroy each other without ever learning that Jehovah is God over the whole earth. But Jehovah stopped the war for the specific purpose of permitting his ‘elect servant<sup>5</sup> class to give the necessary witness to the nations. Prior to that time not even God’s consecrated people gave any special attention to the name of Jehovah. It was God’s will, and therefore necessary, that the people should be informed concerning the importance of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The witness work began in 1919, and a few years thereafter the importance of Jehovah’s name was learned by the “servant” class. Since then the witness work has increased with energy and enthusiasm. While the witness work has continued to progress, Satan has continued to bring one woe after another upon the peoples of earth and he has caused his clergy agents to tell the people that the depression and their suffering and other trouble proceed from Jehovah God because the people have been unfaithful to their church obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah is in no wise responsible for the trouble that has been upon the world for the past eighteen years; but in due time he will take hold upon his glittering sword, enter that fight and destroy the Devil’s organization, that all may know that Jehovah is God over the whole earth. The Devil began the time of trouble and has carried it on in wickedness, but at Armageddon Jehovah will finish that trouble in righteousness by destroying the wicked organization.—Dent. 32:41; Rom. 9:28; Isa. 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah stopped the war and therefore the ruthless destruction of human flesh until his 'elect servant’ class could perform the witness work according to his will; otherwise Satan would have destroyed all flesh. The Lord Jesus said: Tor the elect’s sake that trouble shall be shortened.’ (Matt. 24:21,22) What trouble or days of trouble are shortened? The time of trouble that began in 1914 in unrighteousness and which Jehovah will finish at Armageddon in righteousness. Between these two periods of time the “servant” class must give the testimony as a witness to the nations. The “servant” class is engaged in that very work now. The Devil would destroy them quickly except for the intervention and protection furnished by the Lord God. The “servant” class have learned the importance of Jehovah’s name and know that his name is a strong tower for them, a place of safety, and they rush into it and are safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Daily the remnant should have in mind the year text and the other texts used in connection therewith. Daily they should feed upon the food that the Lord has so graciously provided for their strength and encouragement. Let the “servant” class fear neither man nor devil. Fear God and serve him. Go boldly forward in the witness work. Jehovah will show his strength in behalf of his people and give them the victory through Jesus Christ the world’s great King.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.—Ex. 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus Jehovah revealed himself unto Moses, not as one who had a beginning and who might have an ending, but as I AM, that is to say, the Everlasting One, without beginning and without ending, in fact, the only Being. The expression “human being” is wholly incorrect, because man is a creature, and not a being. There is but one being, and that is the Eternal Creator. The Creator is the Being; all things created are creatures. The name </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font9"> means Creator; </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font9"> the one with limitless power; the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Most High,</span><span class="font9"> the one above all; but wherever </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font9"> is used it has reference to the Almighty One’s purposes toward his creation. Frequently the Scriptures reveal the Most High as “Jehovah of hosts”, meaning the purpose of the Almighty God to successfully fight battles for his people, and against his enemies.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Joh, were in it, they should deliver hut their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God.—Ezeh. 14:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Jehovah makes special mention of a man, then we should look, not to the inherent qualities of that man, but to what he did in Jehovah’s sight that was pleasing to the Most High. Nothing in the Scriptures indicates that Noah, Daniel and Job were physically and mentally stronger than other men. Wliat was it, then, about these three men that called forth God’s approval and their special mention in his Word with commendation? It was fearlessness of the enemy and faithfulness in obedience to God’s commandment which had been given to them. They were uncompromising in their devotion to Jehovah. They were not men that were highly esteemed among other men of the world. They did not give their adulation and high esteem to other men.

<p><span class="font9">The highway is the way out of Babylon, the Devil’s organization, and unto Zion, God’s organization. Prior to Zion’s travail in 1917-1919 the followers Of Christ Jesus were compelled to mingle with the Babylonians. Since then the Lord has revealed to his people the clear distinction between Satan’s organization and God’s organization and discloses to the faithful that they must separate themselves from Babylon and travel “the high road” to get into Zion. When the Lord built up Zion, from that time he appeared in his glory to his people. It was then that the way to Zion was opened to the faithful, and from that time forward the above verse has a spiritual application and for the special admonition and comfort of the remnant.

<p><span class="font9">From the time Jehu was anointed and until he had completed the execution of his divinely given commission he pictured or foreshadowed the work of execution to be done in “the day of the Lord” by Christ Jesus, the Chief Executioner of Jehovah, in which work his body members in glory, the remnant who are members of his body and are now on the earth, and his host of holy angels, all participate. The Jehu work runs parallel with the work foreshadowed by Ezekiel’s prophecy (chapters 9 and 10) concerning ‘the man clothed in linen and with the writer’s inkhorn by his side’, and with the work of marking the foreheads of the people and scattering coals of fire over the city, and with the six men that followed him with slaughter weapons, and the destroying of the city.

<p><span class="font9">Surely it is just as displeasing to the Lord for a man to connive at or willingly receive exaltation from others as it is to do the exalting. He might think he is entitled to credit for something that has been done; but, regardless of the facts, no man is entitled to credit. From the very day God made the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai till now he has emphasized in his Word the great necessity of avoiding Satan’s deceptive trap, and has repeatedly warned his people to refrain from exalting creatures. Let all glory and honor be bestowed upon him to whom it belongs. Satan’s scheme is to induce as many of the consecrated as possible to lean upon some men or man. Doing so puts such ones in position to be very much deceived, and for this reason many are deceived and led away by the tricks of the adversary and fall into the company “the man of sin”.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is in his holy temple, representatively by his Beloved Son Christ Jesus. His glory shines upon and in his organization. Every one who is of the temple class will be in full and complete harmony with the Lord and the work he is now causing to be done on the earth. It is not man’s work, but God’s work, and Jehovah God is the great Administrator thereof, and for this reason it is now the “dispensation of the fulness of times”. Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple class, directs what shall be done by the members of the temple, and it follows that every one in the temple will be showing forth the praises of Jehovah. God’s anointed people now on the earth, that is to say, the remnant, form a part of the servant, and every member thereof must get in harmony with and under the direction of the Lord.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is the God of order; and since he requires everything he approves to be done in order, it follows that all who truly love him will work together as a unit, each one striving faithfully to carry out the instructions as given. No one of the remnant on earth is perfect, but all recognize that it is God’s arrangement to have some one give directions; and if the one placed in that position makes mistakes the Lord himself will overrule his mistakes in his own good way or correct this in whatever manner his wisdom requires. It would therefore be entirely out of order for any to attempt to carry on a different work and in opposition to God’s organization, merely because this can be done. Only those who strive lawfully will enter the kingdom, and striving lawfully means to work according to the Lord’s rules. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/32</span></p>

The truly anointed are now at unity and in full harmony, because Christ is at his temple and Zion is builded up and Christ is the Head of the entire company. There could be no division amongst the Lord God’s anointed people, nor could there be amongst them any who would compromise with the enemy and at the same time receive God’s approval.

His people show full confidence in him by saying: “Let God arise.” The fulfilment of this prophecy would necessarily be at the time when God’s people on earth would be in special need of protection and the time when the enemy would be exposed and destroyed. “Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.” (Isa. 33:10) Now that Jehovah has taken his permanent position in his official headquarters, typified by Mount Zion, the time has come for him to arise for the purpose of rebuking and destroying the enemy organization.

It is the token of God’s approval or official designation of such as his servant or representative ; and Jehovah gives his vote for such by and through Christ Jesus and confers upon the faithful class this favor by giving them the white stone. Such official and authoritative designation is not known or understood by anyone except those who have received the stone, the vote of Jehovah approving them. The new name is written in the stone, meaning that upon this class he confers the great privilege of bearing this name and having a clear understanding of Jehovah and his purposes and communicating the same to the people.

If notice had to be given concerning the approaching deluge and concerning the affliction that would come upon Egypt, it follows that immediately preceding the great battle of the day of God Almighty notice of God’s purpose must be published more extensively than at any previous time.

The placing of Christ Jesus upon his throne, which is the birth of The Nation, was the beginning of the day of rejoicing concerning which Jehovah had caused his prophet long ago to write in the above words. Mark the words: ‘ ‘ Thou that didst not travail with child.” In other words, this man child is born without travail or birth pains. Zion, or God’s woman, had now given birth to the “man child” without pain, and it was a time to begin rejoicing. The kingdom was born without travail, but a fight must follow and did shortly thereafter; and “as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her [other] children”. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/31</span></p>

Those to whom God’s promise is given, and with whom the covenant for the kingdom is made, must prove faithful and must be brought into complete unity with Christ Jesus and God. To this end Jesus prayed for them. He did not pray that they should be merely given a place of honor, but that they might be made one and in complete unanimity in the organization of Jehovah, even as Jehovah and Jesus are one or in complete unity, to the end that all creation might know that Jehovah is God.

<p><span class="font9">“The stone” is Jehovah God’s King whom he placed upon his throne in 1914, and was laid as the chief foundation stone of the temple between that date and the coming to the temple in 1918. Jehovah discloses this great Stone to the remnant class (Joshua) that they may be built up thereon as living stones. -The “seven eyes” upon that Stone represents symbolically all the eyes of the universe. Upon that Stone these eyes are fixed to note his course of action. Particularly it means that the eyes of Jehovah are upon it because The STONE is entrusted with the great work of vindicating Jehovah’s name and in so doing will destroy Satan’s colossal organization. “Those seven, they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.” (Zech. 4:10) That means that The Stone has Jehovah’s full support and approval. This the remnant must proclaim. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 148-150</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.—Eph. 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This means nothing more nor less than complete, absolute and unselfish devotion of the creature to Jehovah, the great Creator. In no other manner could the followers of Christ maintain their integrity toward God. Concerning those ultimately made members of the royal house the apostle says that nothing “shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord”. The decisive test imposed upon the creature is whether or not he really loves Jehovah God. “It is written, Be ye holy; for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">am holy.” This precludes any division of one’s devotion between God and some creature. To be holy means to be fully and entirely devoted to God and his righteousness. Nothing but absolute and complete devotion to God will meet the requirements of the rules which must be obeyed by those who ultimately meet his approval.

<p><span class="font9">God’s remnant are in the desolate condition of the world, and are mentioned by the psalmist as “fatherless” because (1) such have obeyed the commandment to “forget also [your] own people, and [your] father’s house” (Ps. 45:10); (2) they are stripped of all earthly friends and look to Jehovah God for help and strength (Ps. 27:10,11); and (3) during the absence of Christ Jesus, and until his coming to the temple, these were left orphans, but God had sent the holy spirit as advocate and helper for them. Now the holy spirit as a helper has been taken away and Jehovah by his Chief One, Christ Jesus, is with them. The fatherless need a vindicator and protector, and Jehovah makes it his purpose to be such to the remnant. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Seeing that the entire company of God’s people are now engaged in service ministering to each other and to others as required, there seems to be no good reason Scripturally or otherwise to now elect men to office as “deacon” as that term is generally used. Each company by itself or its duly constituted committee may assign certain parts of the service to whomsoever it will. Where there is unity there must be harmony and all will delight to do whatever service is offered, all in the temple being Scripturally elders. The work now to b4 done is to bear testimony to the Word and name of Jehovah. All in the temple do this with joy. All are of one body and at unity, and each one performs whatsoever duties of service may be assigned by the Lord and by his remnant company. All are of Jehovah’s organization and go forward to the honor and vindication of his holy name. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“The king of Babylon” pictures Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great Executive who will wield the sword of his divinely given power to dash to pieces Pharaoh, that is, Satan and his organization. Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth constitute a part of The Christ because they are members of his body. The clear implication is that Jehovah will now strengthen his faithful witnesses to do their part in the great vindication work that is now proceeding. Now these can truly say: “Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teach-eth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.” (Ps. 144:1) Both the friends and the enemies of God will have it proven to them beyond all doubt that Jehovah is supreme. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 146,</span><span class="font9"> 147</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The work of preparing material for Jehovah’s royal house begins with Christ Jesus and the apostles and continues until the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, and at Jehovah’s appointed time the faithful ones are gathered together in Christ Jesus. Those who had been faithful unto death the Lord God then raises up out of death, and all those on earth found faithful at that time, and doing the will of God, are gathered unto the Lord. No others are gathered together than those who are in Christ and who, as new creatures, have been called and chosen, and who are now anointed by the Lord God. This is emphasized by Paul’s words, “he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him [Christ].” This gathering together takes place, according to Ephesians 1:10, in “the fulness of times”.

The fact that Jehovah in our day has brought to the attention of his anointed ones that he is the mighty Rock is further circumstantial proof that we are now in the last days and that the faithful sons of God must now be his witnesses in the earth and declare his name and his works to others.

<p><span class="font9">The nations of earth could not see the honor conferred by Jehovah upon his faithful remnant after these are in heavenly glory.

It is not for the benefit of the remnant, but as a testimony to the name of Jehovah and in vindication of his own great name, which he brings about through Zion his organization.

<p><span class="font9">Every faithful witness of God who was present on “The Day” (September 8, 1922) of the Cedar Point convention will never forget that hour of great blessing. It was like a second Pentecost: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh.” (Acts 2:17,18) It was surely the time of fulfilment of these prophetic words. And those that loved the Lord “stood up upon their feet”. Those that then came to the front were no mere skeletons, by any means, but like “an exceeding great army” in the service, moved by His spirit and His strength, and ready to do His will. This organization that stands up is not a peace-time force, but it is a real military or militant company under the command of Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 290</span></p>

The anointed of the Lord now see that Satan’s organization, composed of the commercial, military, political and religious elements, is symbolized by horses and chariots, and that the people in battle array against the Lord and against his anointed symbolize Satan’s hordes aligned against God’s faithful witnesses. Therefore the words of instruction which Jehovah gave to the Israelites apply with stronger force to God’s people now, to wit, “Be not afraid of them.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">By faith and by the great favor of Jehovah God those of the remnant class now see great truths and hence raise a song of praise to him that rides supreme and victorious through the enemy’s country. In joyful obedience to Jehovah’s commandments these “cast up the highway” for the people, lift up Jehovah’s standard, and lead the way to the kingdom. They extol the Supreme One by the name JAH, and rejoice before him. This seems to say in substance that the name JAH takes preeminence over all other names of the Deity. It calls attention to his purpose and suggests to his people that now the time has come for Jehovah to carry out the completion of his purposes set forth in the Bible for man’s guidance, and, above all, his purpose to vindicate his glorious name.

<p><span class="font9">Worst of all for Job was when the three pious, sanctimonious frauds came to console Job, they claiming to represent God.

Otherwise I shall lose my good reputation which I have so long enjoyed in this land.” Job did not take any such compromising course. He cared nothing for the approval of men; but he cared everything for the approval of Jehovah God, and he unflinchingly held fast to his integrity and in his dire distress cried out the above words. Amidst all his persecutions he remained true and steadfast in his devotion to God, and thereby received Jehovah’s approval. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/32</span></p>

Jehovah informs his faithful sons of the enemy’s tactics and then directs that they prophesy against the enemies before God proceeds to destroy them. One such is Gog, one of the princes in Satan’s organization, invisible, of course, with a possibility of the power to materialize in human form. The land of Magog pictures the spiritual or invisible realm of Satan, and includes Gog and all the wicked angels within Gog’s division of Satan’s organization, which angels “bear rule over all the earth”.

These faithful ones have been invited into and have entered into the joy of the Lord. The enemy and his representatives, by fraud, deceit and coercion which they bring to bear upon the temple class, attempt to prevent them from publishing the name and kingdom of Jehovah God.

Because of the shame and reproach these nations have heaped upon the true believers in and followers of Christ Jesus. These are the people of God which he has taken out from amongst the Gentiles that they might be used by him as a people for his own holy name. Even in this day God has brought a measure of shame upon “Christendom” by the wide circulation of the message of truth printed and put in the hands of the people, including the statements in the ‘seven vials of wrath’.

Jehovah had said to Elijah that he yet had seven thousand in Israel that Jiad not bowed the knee to Baal. The course taken by Jehu strongly supports the conclusion that Jehu was one of these seven thousand.

<p><span class="font9">The facts abundantly show that the “faithful servant” class, although greatly beloved of the Lord, was solitary, lonely, and in a desolate condition until the Lord began to reveal to these faithful ones that the kingdom had been born, and that these faithful followers of Christ Jesus were privileged to make publication of the King and the Kingdom to the glory of Jehovah God’s name. These solitary ones Jehovah then sets “in families” or “in a home”, that is to say, in the organization of the Lord, in the house of the Lord; and he has brought them into a condition of unity in Christ. Necessarily, then, these favored ones must and do see “eye to eye”, and harmoniously they proceed to the publication of the good news of the kingdom and of the day of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Manifestly Jesus was conveying the thought here that if men honor creatures and give them the credit 1hat is due Jehovah their course of action' is abominable in his sight. Sincere love for a brother means an unselfish desire to do good to that one; but to exalt his name is not doing him good. Promotion or exaltation comes from the Lord, not from man. (Ps. 75: 6,7) The Lord knows that those who want to exalt the name of a man are not honest and sincere and do not possess real love for their brother. Those who really love a servant of the Lord delight to acknowledge that they are privileged to be in the same class with him in serving God, but they do not want to be foolish and give the honor to the creature and not to the Creator.

<p><span class="font9">In addition to the precious stones arranged on the breastplate of the high priest there were the Urim and Thummim placed within the folds of the breastplate.

Presumably without the Urim the high priest might offer sacrifice, but could not communicate with God or be used by him as a means of communication to his people. There seems to be a close relationship between the Urim and the white stone mentioned by Jesus, saying: “To him that overeometh will I give ... a white stone, and in the stone a new name written.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Men have made the same grave mistake at all times by attempting to search out and exhibit their own glory and beauty to others. 'When one revels in his own beauty and his own attainments he is deceiving himself. For one to seek to shine as beautiful in the eyes of others is a dangerous course for him. The only safe course is for one to give glory to God for •whatever he has and to fear him and to serve him with gladness of heart. In this day, when the light of truth from God’s temple is shining upon his people, there is absolutely no excuse to give praise and exaltation to men. To seek praise for oneself or to willingly receive praise from others for one’s own attainments and one’s beauty., is dangerous and will lead to disaster, if persisted in. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 101</span></p>

Jehovah has never blessed any attempt of his people in adopting Big Business methods to acquire money for his witness work. In fact, every one who has attempted to resort to such methods upon the pretext of getting money to carry on the Lord’s work has failed. Commercialism has been a bane to God’s people. Whoever has become entangled therewith has received injury, and many have been ‘ drowned in the sea’. Jehovah God alone is the sure support of his people and his cause.

<p><span class="font9">The value of the death of Christ Jesus never ends; therefore it will be for ever proper to have in mind the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus Christ. To be sure, Christ Jesus knew the great issue involved. His sacrificial death proves the unlimited power, the unsearchable wisdom, and the unspeakable love of Jehovah God. It is a vindication of the name and word of Jehovah. In all future ages men will have to bear in mind that life comes to fallen humanity by and through the sacrificial death of Christ Jesus and that there is no other way and no other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved. Without the shedding of his blood sacrificially the sin of the world could not have been taken away and man could never have had life. This, added to the more important thing of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, can never be ignored by men who would live. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The Hebrew word from which “rock’’ is translated means a great cliff or mass of rock.

The mountain of rock is not only symbolic of Jehovah himself, but also symbolic of his universal organization. Jehovah is the source of life. Salvation from the enemy is provided by Jehovah. He is the refuge and fortress for those who fully trust in him. David spoke prophetically of the protection and deliverance from the enemy which Jehovah has provided for his people in the last days, where we now are, and when Satan the enemy is making war against those who keep the commandments of God and to whom is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/32</span></p>

The time has come when all of God’s approved ones on the earth must be of one mind to do the will of God as he has revealed it in his Word. Such maturity could not take place until after the coming of the Lord to the temple of Jehovah and the gathering of the faithful unto himself. Before that the truth revealed was not sufficient to bring the church into fullness of unity of mind and of action. Now is the time of war, and God is assembling his host under Christ for the last fight. It is a time to be awake and on the alert.

No more will he permit his people to be taken in captivity to the humiliation of his own name. No more will he permit his holy name to be profaned by the enemy in any manner. This implies faithfulness on the part of all who get life and remain alive. Seeing that the battle of Armageddon completes the victory of Jehovah, and the preservation of those who love him, will cause the people of God to more fully appreciate him than ever.

They were pruned away as suckers, hangers-on. The judgment of the temple disclosed also another class, the members of which had made a covenant to do the will of God and had been bearing some fruit by preaching the Word, but became offended at the Lord and his organization and were gathered out by the angel of the Lord and thus cut off as branches and no longer counted as branches in the vine. Judas must have represented that class. The faithful branches which remain bear the fruits of the kingdom in obedience to God’s commandment, because they are in the temple and sing forth his praises and tell of his wondrous works.

Even so now, the faithful remnant are at the front and continuing to march forward, and they sing the praises of Jehovah and will continue thus to do until his name is completely vindicated. “And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.”— Isa. 12:4.

(Eph. 4:11,12) This proves that the “men” to whom Jesus “gave gifts” were not mankind in general, but those who were and are made members of the Christ while yet in the flesh, and for the perfecting of the saints. Although he died as a ransom for all, yet he must receive and accept mankind as a gift from Jehovah in due time. For this reason, at the end of his reign he will turn over the kingdom to Jehovah God.

This is entirely wrong, and a wrong application of Jesus’ words concerning the “man by whom the offence cometh”, which words apply to the “man of sin”, the “evil servant” class. (Matt. 18:7) One who really loves God as Christ loves him cannot be turned away or separated from God and his organization by angels, powers, things present or future, or by any man or any creature. &quot;Whether any creature who claims to be a brother in Christ treats you ill or well, pleases or displeases you, such is no excuse or justification for you to cease full devotion and service to the Lord God.

It would be expected that God would show the watchman what is his own organization and his purposes in his organization, and would also disclose to the watchman the enemy organization; furthermore, that God would reveal to the watchman the great issue that must now be settled, and why the battle of Armageddon will be fought. This is exactly what the Lord has given to the temple class during the past few years. It is not their warning, but the Lord’s message of warning, that must be given.

<p><span class="font9">Christ Jesus gives order to his angels to remove “the filthy garments” from the faithful remnant (pictured by Joshua), that they might be identified with God’s clean organization. Then the Lord Jesus speaks to them and says: “I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee.” This corresponds exactly with Isaiah’s prophecy concerning those found faithful upon the Lord’s coming to his temple and who then must be cleansed: “Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, . . . and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away.” Jehovah does this cleansing work by Christ Jesus. The remnant is then given a “change of raiment”, otherwise Tendered “festive garments”.

Elijah did a destructive work also in. the slaying of the prophets of Baal, and thereby pictured the slaying of satanie doctrines of “Christendom” by the promulgation of the truth prior to 1918.

Necessarily the members thereof must be united, because all are begotten of one spirit, all are called in one hope of their calling to the kingdom, all chosen and anointed, and all made members of the company of Jehovah’s witnesses.

(Mie. 5:2-4) It is the day when the Shepherd is amongst his people; the day of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering unto him who is the Head of Jehovah’s organization.

Man’s greatest privilege is to be on the side of Jehovah God. Satan, however, endeavors to bring about conditions to induce man to believe that God has forsaken him. Man, therefore, needs to continually feed upon the food convenient for him, that is to say, that which builds him up in the most holy faith.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly.—Josh. 11:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is Jehovah permitting his witnesses to be persecuted as a test to prove thereby their integrity ? That is one reason; but there is another and a far more important reason. This latter reason the remnant must keep in mind at all times. The vindication of Jehovah’s name is at hand. One means of vindicating his name is the destruction of all his enemies; but before this is done he has commanded and commissioned the “faithful servant” class to serve notice upon the enemy concerning the day of impending destruction. Jehovah does not take action against his enemy by secret. He has chosen the remnant to serve notice upon the enemy now. The members of Satan’s organization will be destroyed, but only after due notice of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy them. He will give members of Satan’s organization ample opportunity to identify themselves with Satan. IV </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Regardless of all the advantageous things with which a creature is endowed, if he does not fear God and serve him he is certain to come to a bad end. This is proven by the course Lucifer took. Ezekiel 28:17 says of him: “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.” Without a doubt Lucifer was originally a creature of beauty. But God did not make him “perfect in beauty” to cause him to fall. Lucifer should have appreciated the faet that all he possessed was a gift from Jehovah God and he should have given God the credit and honor therefor.

<p><span class="font9">It was ‘'Christendom” that instigated the persecution of God’s people during the World War. The modern Moabites there had the opportunity of furnishing some succor and help to God’s covenant people then in trouble, but instead of so doing they rejoiced at the tribulation that came upon the faithful children of God during the period from 1917 to 1919 and hence these faithful ones were scattered and persecuted. Furthermore, after the destruction of “organized Christianity” all who serve God in fact or claim to serve him will be in disrepute in the minds of the class represented by the Moabites. Such is and will be a great insult and reproach to Jehovah God. The name of Jehovah will be vindicated, and all must come to know that he is God. Therefore he will visit the modem Moabites and properly recompense such. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 37, 33</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s day of judgment is here and his great Judicial Officer, Christ Jesus, is sitting in judgment upon those who are of the house of God and those who profess to be of the house of God, particularly that which is called “organized Christianity”. In this day of judgment Jehovah will have on earth a company which will act in the capacity of witnesses for him; in so doing they are moved entirely by complete unselfishness; they must be frank, plain, bold and outspoken in giving their testimony, and they must do so without fear of man, Satan or any part of Satan’s organization, fearing only God, and they must conduct themselves with the poise and dignity befitting their high and favored position. To be a witness of Jehovah now is the greatest honor that could be conferred upon anyone upon earth. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is the God of order, and that is of itself proof that he has an organization. Jehovah is supreme, the Most High, and absolute Dictator over his organization. The Chief One in his organization, and therefore next to Jehovah, is Christ Jesus, the duly appointed and anointed and installed King of his holy organization. Associated with Christ Jesus as subordinate members of that organization is a company of 144,000 who are designated as members of the body of Christ. In this body or organized company Jehovah places the respective members according to his pleasure. The Christ constitutes the capital of Jehovah’s organization, and necessarily that organization is made up according to the will of God. An organization of creatures that is not formed according to the will of God could not be any part of Jehovah’s organization.

<p><span class="font9">It is these elders, including the anointed and faithful remnant on the earth, that see the birth or beginning of the kingdom and learn that it will vindicate Jehovah’s name, and they rejoice, giving praise to God. They are pictured as standing on Mount Zion with the Lord. They receive the crown of glory or badge of honor by virtue of being brought into oneness and made a part of Christ. This is the vision given to the temple class and is seen and appreciated by none other on earth. Those having this vision are all Seripturally designated as elders, and they are elders because they have received Jehovah’s approval and delight to serve him.

<p><span class="font9">Men have nothing to do with gathering these offenders and iniquitous workers out of the kingdom. The angels, at the Lord’s commandment, do that work. Immediately following such gathering out those thus gathered out set up a wail or complaint and begin to gnash their teeth in expression of chagrin, hatred, ill will and malice, directed against those who remain true and faithful to God. It does not appear that such wailing, weeping and gnashing of teeth is due to the fact that the ones so doing are greatly disappointed because they have come to a realization that they have lost opportunity to enter into the kingdom. The wailing and gnashing of teeth shows a bad condition of heart and identifies the ones indulging therein as the ones that have failed under the decisive test of love for Jehovah.

<p><span class="font9">All creation will have reason to know at Armageddon that the Almighty God is manifesting his power against the enemy. Jehovah will rain down upon the enemy destructive missiles from heaven as he did upon Sisera by the waters of Megiddo; also at the first battle of Perazim; also at the battle of Gibeon. The enemy has had knowledge of these examples foreshadowing Armageddon but has taken no heed thereto. The final fight will come and the Lord will make a complete work of it. Satan will see his forces completely whipped before he is chained, and then he will go into the pit. Now Jehovah is defamed.

<p><span class="font9">The great “widow”, whose advocate and vindicator Jehovah has become, is, of course, Zion, his organization. The time comes when her widowhood ceases and her reproach is taken away, and Jehovah says to her: “Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” In 1918 Jehovah began the building up of Zion, and then he made his “widow” fruitful and her children began to praise his name; and relating thereto it is written: “He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/32</span></p>

I here and now definitely give my word that my woman or organization shall in my own due time be fruitful, because I will make her fertile; and she shall bear a seed, and that seed shall destroy Satan and all his power; and “The Seed”, or offspring of my woman, shall rule the whole world, and that rule shall be a righteous rule, which will bring blessings to all the nations of the earth.’ Just as certain as Jehovah gave his word, just that certain it will be fulfilled in every detail, and that in his own due time. Instead of immediately producing “The Seed” and using it to destroy Satan, God waited his own due time to do this. Now “The Seed” has been produced, and the destruction of Satan and his seed must now follow. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/31</span></p>

Let no one be foolish or unwise or attempt to get himself into the position of a martyr.

The new creation is one generation of the Lord, and the princes are another generation. Without a question of doubt when these princes are brought back to earth they will sing praises to the name of Jehovah and will take up the song that the remnant has raised and carry it on for ever.

Not one of those that God approved failed under the test because of fear. God sent Noah to warn the people of the world concerning the impending destruction by the great deluge of water that followed. By doing faithfully his duty Noah made himself unpopular with everyone aside from the members of his immediate family. The people mocked at him and jeered him, and year after year Noah steadfastly went forward telling the truth to the people. It was Noah’s faithfulness and devotion that pleased God.

If one is not this kind of servant of the Lord he could not be an accurate witness for the Lord in these days when the testimony must be given.

The approved ones must be for Jehovah God, first, last and all the time. The moving cause for such course of uncompromising devotion to God must not be a desire or hope for personal gain or for the possession of power and authority, but must be entirely that of an unselfish desire to obey and please and to serve Jehovah. Thereby the creature proves what is in his heart, which is the seat of motive. He must have his mind set upon Jehovah and his righteous cause. The mind must be pure, and the motive, represented by the heart, likewise pure. Thus the creature must prove his love for God is supreme, loving Jehovah with all his heart, mind and soul.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said. Take, eat; this is my body.—Matt. 26:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By that Jesus meant that ‘this bread stands for or represents my body, and the breaking of the bread represents that I am broken or put to death for your benefit’. God has provided that men shall take material food into the mouth and eat it in order to sustain the organism. He has also provided that his consecrated sons shall take spiritual food into the mind and absorb it, that the spiritual life may be maintained. The eating of the bread at the Memorial means that those properly eating thereof believe and rely upon Christ Jesus as their Redeemer and God’s provision for them to have life. It represents their faith in the great ransom sacrifice. Truly, then, Christ Jesus is the passover of those who enter into the covenant to do God’s will and faithfully keep it.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that 1 am baptized with.—Matt. 20:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The cup contains a potion or drink prepared for those who drink it. The cup which Jesus handed to his disciples on the night preceding his death, and which he invited them to drink, therefore symbolizes that which Jehovah God has prepared and provided for Christ Jesus and his body members. Otherwise stated, it represents Jehovah’s purposes concerning his sons. For this reason Jesus, after he had selected his disciples, after he had been anointed as King, and after he had taught them concerning the kingdom, said to them: “Are ye able to drink of the cup I shall drink of?” When they answered in the affirmative he gave promise that they should drink thereof. Jesus knew that he must die to fulfil the purpose of Jehovah, and the purpose of Jehovah concerning him and his body was therefore symbolized by the cup.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast.—1 Cor. 5: 7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So the Lord’s anointed do, in joy and not in sorrow. These rejoice that the Lord Jesus was broken and that he poured out his lifeblood and that they might, by his invitation and God’s favor, have a part in his sufferings and his death. They rejoice because they know that in no other way could they live and become a part of his kingdom and participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which latter is the cause for the greatest joy. To such the reason for keeping the Memorial now is to keep in mind the suffering and death of the Lord Jesus, and the value his death brings to mankind, and that by suffering with him the faithful are permitted to enter into his joy and, continuing faithful, to reign with him. “It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave, it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.—Matt. 26:27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To paraphrase his words, Jesus said: ‘This cup contains wine, and it symbolically stands for my blood, which is shed for the remission of sins. It is the blood that seals the new covenant. I invite you all to drink of it. My faithful followers will all drink of it, and will drink it all. It means you must share with me in my death in order that you may have immortal life.’ As he also said: “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.” All mankind must by faith eat the bread, but only The Christ drink the blood. No one can be of the firstborn who are saved as such, except he share in Christ’s sacrificial death, because such is the potion poured by Jehovah for his anointed ones.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">I .will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.—Matt. 26:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The wine contained in the cup was the fruit of the vine. It represented the shed blood of Christ Jesus, because he said so, and that is conclusive. Jesus, however, did not limit the cup and its contents symbolically to mean his death. Understanding that the cup, including its contents, symbolizes or represents God’s purpose concerning his anointed ones, then we know that it represented more than the suffering and death of Christ Jesus, because the purpose of Jehovah did not end with his suffering and death. It is recorded in God’s Word: “Wine . . . maketh glad the heart of man.” The fruit of the vine which Jesus drinks new with his faithful ones in the kingdom, therefore, must represent joy and a time of rejoicing. This has now begun, because the time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.—l Cor. 11:26,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This does not necessarily mean that when he does come they will cease to show forth his death, bnt rather that until his coming they could not enter into his joy and share with him in drinking the fruit of the vine new in the kingdom. Until that time they must show forth his death, and nothing more; but from and after that time they must continue to remember his death and also enter into his joy. Therefore a joy was set before them; but when he appears at the temple, brings the approved into the temple, and covers them with the robe of righteousness, and they learn of this fact, it is then the time for these faithful ones to experience the joy that had been set before them. By thus entering into the joy of their Lord these drink with him the fruit of the vine new in the kingdom. 17 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It is utterly impossible for any division to now exist between those whom the Lord approves. They must now be at unity. All who oppose the witness work of God’s remnant are opposing God. Dissension and quibbling and quarreling amongst God’s people are entirely out of order, and those who cause trouble the angel of the Lord will certainly gather out. The army of the Lord must march as one unit, in solid phalanx, and that without wavering or turning aside. If the enemy attempts to inject strife and division in any company, let every one who loves God lay aside all selfishness, ascertain the real root of the difficulty, and put it away, and let peace prevail, if you would hold fast that which you have. There cannot be harmony with song unless all of the company keep together. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">U/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">God will expose to view the hypocritical false professors and false witnesses so that the people may have to excuse in refusing to hear his truth. “Curse” or “oath” means a solemn statement or declaration made with an appeal to Jehovah to sanction that such statement or declaration is true. The Lord therefore says concerning the professed followers of Christ Jesus who call themselves Christians, servants of the Lord, but who honor the name of creatures and not that of the Creator, that such shall be removed and “ye shall leave your name for a curse”; meaning that there shall be a solemn statement or declaration, made with Jehovah’s approval that such is the truth, to the effect that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">these professed ones are not the chosen witnesses of the Lord; and that then Jehovah will call his reed and faithful servant by another name.</span><span class="font9"> W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The day of God’s wrath is come upon all nations and upon all operations of Satan’s organization, and the Devil himself knows that fact. It seems strange that there are now on the earth many spirit-begotten ones who claim to love God and yet do not see or appreciate the fact that the day of God’s wrath is quickly to be expressed against all the nations. Those who fail to see this are missing a great opportunity to proclaim the truth. It is a dark day on Satan’s organization, and its being “a cloudy day” portends that Jehovah is present and is very near to the time of the execution of his vengeance upon Satan’s organization and to the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 131</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The “dispensation” or economy or “administration” here mentioned is the work of Jehovah himself, acting by and through his Beloved Son Christ Jesus. “The fulness of the seasons” or times therefore means the same as “the day of Jehovah” or “that day”, as these terms are used in the Old Testament. It is in this “day of Jehovah” that he comes forth to honor and to vindicate his own name. He places his Beloved One upon his holy hill in Zion and then sends him forth to rule, and thus he sends his glory to his temple, those who are in Christ. (Ezek. 43:2) It is the time when his words are fulfilled: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” To those thus gathered together in Christ he says: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Every one who is faithful must, from the time of being brought forth as a son of God, continue to grow in the likeness of Jesus Christ. To be pleasing to God he must use the faculties with which he is endowed and bear the kingdom fruits, and do it joyfully and fearlessly. Such fruits of the kingdom are the life-sustaining truths that are made known by the Lord for the salvation of men and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. There is no one man mentioned in the Bible with approval (aside from Jesus Christ) who was a perfect character. On the contrary, every one of them was imperfect, but each one of the approved ones walked in the same way that Jesus Christ walked, to wit, without compromise, and unswerving in his devotion to Jehovah God. Such a course, and that alone, brings forth the approval of Jehovah. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/32</span></p>

No man had anything to do with the bringing of this plentiful rain of truth, except so far as man has willingly been used as an instrument or permitted by the Lord to bear these truths of God to others. Jehovah manifestly did send a plentiful shower of rain, meaning copious showers of truth, for the purpose of comforting and-establishing his people; and for any creature to give credit to a man for these showers of truth is to show a lack of appreciation of God and of the loving-kindness he has bestowed upon his people.

Satan is the real opposer of the building up of the people of God into his holy temple, because that temple class will be used by the Lord to discredit Satan and to vindicate Jehovah’s name. As Satan used the Samaritans to hinder the Jews in rebuilding the prophetic temple in Joshua’s day, even so now Satan uses their counterparts, the religious hybrids, the clergy, and their allies, “the man of sin,” to threaten, oppose, arrest and persecute the remnant now on earth who have to do with God’s royal house.

We should expect then that at the end of the age the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah would be in the fourth year, to wit, three and one-half years after the beginning of his reign in 1914, and that therefore the time for his coming to Jehovah’s temple would be in the spring of A.D. 1918.

<p><span class="font9">Jesus declares that God’s faithful witnesses shall be arrested and dragged into court at the instance of the clergy, and that thus their faithful devotion to Jehovah will constitute a witness against the ones of Satan’s organization who are responsible for such persecution. The Lord will cause the enemies to convict themselves by their own wrongful course of action. This they wall do after receiving notice from God. The chief reason, therefore, why Jehovah permits his witnesses to now suffer persecution at the hand of men is in order that these persecutors may identify themselves as of Satan’s organization and hence against Jehovah God. Keep in mind, then, these two reasons why this persecution continues, to wit, as a test upon the remnant, and to afford opportunity for the peoples of the world to identify themselves with Satan’s organization and as against God.

The conspiracy, hatched in Satan’s mind and prosecuted by his prince Gog, may start by the commission of overt acts within the realm of the seventh world power and spread to all parts of the earth where God’s people are located.

It was then that such entered into the joy of the Lord and which will be everlasting, and hence then such “come with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads”.

At the time the remnant begins the song Jehovah had installed his anointed King on his holy hill of Zion and commanded his beloved King to oust Satan from heaven and to break his power in the earth. In 1919 the Lord delivered his remnant people from the bondage of Babylon, the earthly part of Satan’s organization, that they might go forward and publish his name and his kingdom. Then he revealed to them that Zion was built up, and he gave the remnant an understanding of the great issue raised by the enemy concerning his word and his name. It is these great truths revealed to the remnant that has evoked the song. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/32</span></p>

The “crown of glory” above mentioned means a badge of royalty denoting approval by the Lord and recognition as one in his organization. This “crown of glory” is not bestowed because one has been elected to an office by the votes of men, but is bestowed upon all the faithful, including the faithful pioneers, whom we sometimes call “colporteurs”, and all others who are faithful and are made members of the ‘elect servant’. Jehovah says concerning such: “My glory will I not give to another,” but to the ‘elect servant’ class. To such, including the faithful remnant on earth, the Lord says: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord [Jehovah] is risen upon thee.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/32</span></p>

These faithful witnesses are now maintaining their integrity toward God, and their “light affliction” that comes upon them by reason of faithfulness does not discourage them, because they know that such is working out for them “a far more exceeding and etemcd weight of glory”.

They are now able to clearly see and do see that the “higher powers” are not anyone of Satan’s organization, as they formerly believed, but that these “higher powers” are the ruling ones in God’s organization. The Lord’s true people have been separated from the false by his pure water of truth and are clean, and are not contaminated by mixing further with Satan’s organization.

Long ago Moses was chosen by Jehovah to deliver his people out of Egypt and lead them into a place of safety. Jehovah spoke to Moses in Mount Horeb, which is called “the mount of God”. (Ex. 3:1; 1 Ki. 19:8) Jehovah told Moses that his chosen people must be brought out of Egypt (Satan’s organization) and that they should come and worship Jehovah “upon this mountain”. This is proof that Mount Horeb was a symbol of God’s organization and meant that God’s people must leave Satan’s organization and come and worship Jehovah, if they would live. It was there at Mount Horeb that God confirmed a covenant with the Israelites; and the New Testament bears testimony to the fact that the mountain pictures Jehovah’s organization or government.—Heb. 12: 24-29.

They cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress and heals them and cleanses them with his Word of truth and delivers them from destruction. (Ps. 107:17-19) They wash their robes and make them clean by faithfully devoting themselves to God and to Christ in the time of great tribulation, and this they must do before they enter upon the “highway”.

What these faithful ones do strikes terror to the heart of the enemy and at the same time encourages all who are in the faithful ranks of the Lord.

Now is the time when the remnant who are the witnesses of Jehovah must publish these great truths in order that they may meet their obligation toward Jehovah and maintain their integrity toward him. Therefore the psalmist addresses God’s “faithful servant” class and declares that Jehovah has commandeered all the strength of his “servant” class at this time, hence such must love him with all their strength.

This pruning process could hardly mean the removing from individuals such things as wealth, and position in the world, and loved ones of one’s family, as this matter has been generally understood. There must be a deeper meaning here. The pruning work seems to be the taking away of those who are merely suckers and hangers-on and who do not bear any fruit and yet who do not oppose the Lord.

The weeping and wailing results not from sincere and godly sorrow, but is an expression of anger and chagrin, which is induced by selfishness. The grating of teeth is the expression of chagrin, hatred, ill will and malice, directed against those who remain true and faithful to God; and those who indulge in such expression of maliee and hatred are the ones whom the Lord has rejected and gathered out from the kingdom.

Anyone who fails or refuses to take an active part in serving God by giving testimony as Jehovah’s witness at this time, or who opposes such service in proclaiming his name and kingdom, of necessity must be excluded from God’s organization.

<p><span class="font9">Such as willfully and maliciously oppose those who are faithfully endeavoring to serve God by bearing witness to his name and his kingdom are the opposers of Jehovah. Mount Seir, or Edom, pictures such a class of the enemies of God. This class, once enlightened and claiming to be spiritual brothers of the Lord’s faithful sons, thereafter prove themselves unfaithful to their eovenant and barter away their inheritance in the kingdom, and this they do for a selfish reason. These join in the alliance or conspiracy with the Devil. God’s faithful servants whom Ezekiel foreshadowed are to turn their attention against the enemies of God and count them as their own enemies. Whom God hates, his true sons likewise hate. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">VII, 245</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jehonadab answered that he was in sympathy with Jehu. He knew that Jehu was doing the Lord Jeho-wah’s work and that it was a righteous work. He was in full sympathy with it. Even so today the peoples of good will, who believe in Jehovah and his Word, believe that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a righteous work in Jehovah’s name, and they are in full heart sympathy with such work and they tell others so. Jehu gave Jehonadab the invitation to come along with and associate himself with Jehu doing the Lord’s work. This corresponds to many good people of today who are hearing the truth, many of whom attend the conventions of God’s people and who support Jehovah’s witnesses with full heart sympathy and associate themselves with the anointed who are doing the Lord’s work, and who take some part in giving the testimony also. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 80</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;—Ps. 26:1,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The twenty-sixth psalm is further proof that love for God means that the creature must and does trust entirely in the Lord and his righteousness, and not in himself; that his heart is perfect toward God; that he is guided by the truth, and not by outside influence; that he refuses to have any part with dissemblers, and shuns the company of evildoers; and that he delights to have part in the service of God by publishing the truth to the honor of Jehovah’s name. Thus he maintains his integrity toward Jehovah. Those composing this class are not thinking of self, but are unselfishly giving attention to the interest of the kingdom of God. This they do because they love God and are keeping his commandments gladly. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The acts of Satan’s earthly representatives in identifying themselves must first take place before the final slaughter at Armageddon, and the opportunity is being furnished to them to so identify themselves. This they are doing after hearing the testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses. These faithful witnesses of Jehovah are suffering for righteousness’ sake, for the sake of Jehovah’s name. While such suffering and persecution afford opportunity for them to maintain their integrity toward God, yet the far more important reason for their persecution is that they might be used to give the opposers of God an opportunity to identify themselves as God’s enemies before their destruction. This is done in vindication of Jehovah’s name, and in this the remnant have a part. IF </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Zechariah, in the grip of the vision, speaks by inspiration of God’s spirit concerning the proper apparel to be worn by Joshua the high priest. The “mitre” or headdress would denote vision empowering God’s remnant today to work and enlightening their heads or minds as to the terms of their commission ; and this would reflect the glory of the Lord God, which he gives to none other aside from his servant. When the temple was destroyed the high priest’s work was suspended. To have the mitre put back on the head would bring great joy to the priest and would represent the approval corresponding to the joy of the remnant at the present time. Thus clothed, Joshua shows the approval and identification of God’s remnant as members of God’s organization to do temple service. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 143, 144</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah will execute his vengeance against those who after having received his favor spurn his goodness, disobey his commandments, and persecute those who delight to do his will. Such are the modern Edomites. Christ Jesus, the chief executive of Jehovah, will execute his vengeance against them. All the members of the capital organization of Jehovah, including the faithful remnant on earth, are given some part in the execution of this judgment. The remnant now on the earth have to do with this in that they declare the day of God’s vengeance upon his enemies. Those who are devoted to Jehovah will see the expression of his righteous indignation against his enemies and will rejoice in the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 43-45</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah has now appeared at his temple on Mount Zion and has rejected Satan’s organization and has caused antitypieal Bashan to become very mad, envious and jealous. Therefore Satan’s organization looks askance, and with envious glances, at God’s organization. Especially the clergy look at God’s witnesses and speak with hatred and ill will concerning them and loudly proclaim that God’s kingdom on earth is represented by the clergy. The psalmist informs Satan’s organization that Jehovah has chosen Mount Zion for his kingdom, and the kingdom of his Christ, as his official seat; and that there he will abide forevermore; and that Satan’s organization must now suffer everlasting defeat.

<p><span class="font9">God has spoken it; he will also do it. Nothing can set aside or prevent the carrying out of his purposes. Jehovah’s witnesses continue to suffer abuse and reproach at the hands of God’s enemies, but they are neither discouraged nor dismayed. When they go from house to house to bear the testimony concerning the goodness of God and his kingdom these faithful witnesses are often reproached and Satan’s agents frequently cause their arrest and persecution and imprisonment. In all this they rejoice because God has given his word that in his due time he will destroy the enemies and lift up those who love him. Jehovah will vindicate his witnesses before his enemies, and this will vindicate his name and let it be known that he loves and preserves those who love and faithfully serve him. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">VII, 253</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Being in the government’s employ might have been even a greater excuse for them to observe the king’s law regardless of what it was. The record of this test of these three men manifestly was made and kept that it might appear what is the proper course for a consecrated one to follow and what is pleasing to Jehovah. Their faith in God and their faithfulness to Jehovah brought forth his approval and their deliverance, and show what is pleasing to God. It is not pleasing to God for men to take a compromising course and to excuse themselves on the ground that any other course would bring reproach upon his truth. Jehovah will take care of the truth; and what he commands is obedience of his people to him. It is not material what other people may think. That which is of all-importance is what God requires.

<p><span class="font9">The purpose of Jehovah in gathering together “all things in Christ” is that such may have a part in the work of making known and hence vindicating his name. Jehovah has a work to be done in this day and he has thus favored the remnant in permitting them to have a part in that work. Clearly he marks out their work for them and tells them to go about amongst the people serving notice upon the world and giving comfort to those that mourn, that his holy name may be known. This he does that none may have excuse for failing to know that Jehovah is God. The work of the remnant, therefore, is not a propaganda scheme, nor a book-selling scheme, but is a work for which Jehovah has prepared them and fixed the time.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; for He shall be with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 35:8, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since no unclean one shall pass over the “ highway ”, it would not seem to be consistent to say that the “highway” is for the purpose of removing the uncleanness, but rather that the uncleanness must be removed before traveling upon or over the “highway”. The Prophet Isaiah (52:11,12) also wrote: “Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord. For ye shall not go out with haste, nor by flight; for the Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.” This proves that the followers of Christ Jesus must be separate from Satan’s organization, and be clean before they bear the vessels of the Lord, and while marching in the way Jehovah will guard their rear from the enemy.

Hence this prophecy may have a twofold fulfilment: (1) with reference to the wild beasts and fowls that are called upon to feed upon the fallen foe; and (2) symbolically with reference to the remnant of God’s people. God’s remnant will feast upon the great truths and fact that they are privileged to see the holy name of Jehovah God completely vindicated by the wiping out of the enemy and the cleansing of the world.

In no other way could the universe be made clean and the name of Jehovah made to occupy the place where it belongs in the hearts and minds of his creatures. His judgments against his enemies are written. In the execution of these judgments Jehovah employs certain of his creatures that are loyal, true and faithful to him. An executioner is one who executes a legal judgment in conformity to his certificate of authority or commission. The one who renders the judgment takes the responsibility therefor. The executioner is merely the arm of the law or supreme authority. God’s executioner is a vindicator of his name. The judgment of Jehovah God against his enemies declares that they shall be destroyed. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 11</span></p>

The chief foundation Stone must be laid in completeness on the “height of mount Zion”, or holy hill of Zion. Satan coveted to ascend on high and was forced to descend to the earth from which Jesus Christ had ascended after his resurrection; and now nineteen centuries thereafter Jesus Christ ascends to his highest place, and the name of his Father he will now vindicate.

It is the “evil servant” class. Such offender is used by Satan to entrap, to deceive and to ensnare others who are in line for the kingdom. Jesus did not say that he would gather out from the kingdom those who become hurt or offended at their brethren, but would gather out “all things that offend, and them which do iniquity”. It is therefore the selfish who, because of selfishness, try to trap and induce others to follow them that thereby become offenders and bring offenses. Under the test they are disapproved and fall away to Satan and do his service; they work unlawfully, or contrary to God’s way, and are therefore workers of iniquity.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God is the everlasting King, and therefore the Ruler without end. He is the Eternal God of order and therefore has had an organization for ever, and which we call his universal organization. From his Word he makes it clear that his purpose is to have an organization “cut out without hands”, or taken from his organization universal, and then made the capital over his entire organization. That capital organization is otherwise designated in his Word the ‘reigning’ or ‘royal’ house. Satan, the opposer of Jehovah, has builded his own house or organization and made himself the head thereof, which organization is desperately wicked. Against Satan’s organization Jehovah will express his wrath, and no part of it shall be able to abide the Almighty’s wrath. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 172</span></p>

The joy of the Lord, pictured by the drinking of the fruit of the vine, began with the faithful ones on earth when they were brought into the temple and learned of that fact, and learned that the chief purpose of Jehovah, by and through his kingdom, is the vindication of his name, and that he will use those who maintain their integrity toward him to carry out his purpose and to have a part in the vindication of his name.

(Vs. 15) Then those of the “prisoner” class and those of good will and honest hearts will know exactly where to look for the truth and then, as the prophet says, will bless themselves “in the God of truth”, literally, “the God of the Amen,” meaning the God of the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the blessings come. The people must have an opportunity to know that this is the truth, the testimony of which was delivered by the Lord Jesus Christ, and which he has committed to his faithful remnant, laying upon such the obligation of delivering it.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. —Ps. 149:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Zion, the city or organization of God, was not built until the coming of the Lord to the temple of Jeho-wah in 1918. Prior to that time those who are in Christ Jesus and his followers were on the way to Zion, but were not children of Zion and could not be until God’s due time came to build up Zion. When Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah for judgment, that determined who were the children of Zion; and the ones whom he found faithful and brought into the temple, and made a part of God’-s organization, constitute the faithful “servant” class, and the promuse is to such that these shall be taught of God; and these are taught of Jehovah and are now joyful in their King. Those who deny that God has an organization on earth surely could not be of God’s organization, counted as the children thereof, nor be taught by Jehovah. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jesus’ words show that one must become a child of Zion first, and that that takes place only in “the last days”, when God builds up Zion and appears in his g’lory. God had anointed Jesus to be the Head or capital of God’s organization, and Jesus was taught of Jehovah; hence he said that he came to speak, not his words, but the words of his Father who sent him. With the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah in 1918, and the building up of. Zion, and the bringing of the approved ones into Zion and making them a part of the organization, these are therefore the children of Zion, and to these the promise is limited that the children shall be taught of the heavenly Father. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The prosperity of God’s faithful people must therefore begin before the heathen nations are dashed to pieces at Armageddon, in order that these nations may know that the hand of Jehovah God is doing these things. Since the World War God has caused his King at his temple to revive his work and his people as to the interests of his kingdom. Companies of the faithful have been formed and organized for active service and are serving the kingdom interests. New “plantations” in the nature of offices, factories and organizations in many parts of the earth have been formed and established to carry forward (and are carrying forward) the kingdom work. God’s people have pushed forward, and each year he has blessed their efforts by a wider witness. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 260</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The birth of the “man child” or kingdom in 1914 was without pain; but immediately following the birth of the kingdom Zion’s birth pains began, “for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” In other words, as soon as the war in heaven had ended, the resurrection of the faithful began and God began to bring forth the children of his woman Zion; his organization travailed or fought against the enemy, and there followed the birth of her children. The coming of the Lord to the temple of God in 1918 marks the beginning of the birth of Zion’s children, and those whom the Lord Jesus then found faithful he took into his temple, and they entered into his joy; and such constitute the children of Zion.

<p><span class="font9">The Scriptural qualifications to be had by Jehovah’s witnesses are these: Full and complete consecration to do God’s will, and then doing his will; being begotten of God, and called to the kingdom, responding to the call, being chosen and approved for faithfulness, and brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness. Such then become the children of God by Zion. Of such, full obedience to the Lord’s commandments is required so far as it lies within us to obey. Such must be completely devoted to God and then do with their might what their hands find to do, that is, in accord with Jehovah’s expressed will. It is not for any man or body of men to arbitrarily determine just who are Jehovah’s witnesses, but each one must determine for himself whether or not he is Jehovah’s witness, basing his conclusion upon the witness of the holy spirit and his action in harmony therewith. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/31</span></p>

He must continue to be faithful in obedience to God’s commandment even unto death. Indifference and negligence will not be tolerated by the Lord. What righteousness one has done or the righteous position that he occupies today will not save him in the day that he sins. There is no obligation upon God’s part to excuse wrongdoing merely because one has once been righteous. No man can be righteous of himself; but his righteousness is by reason of what God does for him. If one then willfully sins against the light there is no forgiveness for such. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 212, 213</span></p>

Such commission cannot be fulfilled by merely saying, “I love Jehovah.” Words mean nothing unless accompanied by consistent action. We are now in “that day” concerning which Jehovah says: “Call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.” The fulfilment of this commandment by the remnant can be accomplished only by their tairing a bold initiative in making known the name of Jehovah and that the time is here for the vindication thereof.

Any man who resorts to Big Business methods could not possibly be in God’s kingdom. Anyone at this time who has received from the Lord the privilege of serving him and who then of his own volition turns aside from that service for the mere purpose of engaging in commercial pursuits to enrich himself by acquiring money and property shows that he does not appreciate the kingdom nor does he appreciate the fact that the kingdom is here.

This not only is wrong, but must be very displeasing to the Lord. “Shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?” (Isa. 29:16) To give man the credit for the understanding and publication of God’s truth is an insult to Jehovah.

The remnant now on earth is the “brand plucked out of the fire”, the brand that withstood the fire with which the “refiner and purifier” cleansed God’s people when appearing at the temple.

Jehovah has doubly impressed upon the mind of the “servant” this truth by putting into the mouth of the remnant the very words expressing God’s will. The “servant” is the work of Jehovah’s hands and hence praises Him. He speaks of the glory of the kingdom of God and talks of his boundless power. Why is this done? “To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” God’s “servant” tells the sons of men that the kingdom of Jehovah is an everlasting kingdom and shall endure throughout all generations. This is good news to those of the “servant”, and this good news must be passed on to others now on earth. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 25:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the scriptures that mention weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth’ relate to the kingdom, and their application is limited to those who respond to the call to the kingdom and who are not chosen for the reason that they fail under the decisive test. They do not love Jehovah. By their course of action they place themselves against God and on the side of Satan. So far as the great issue involving • them is concerned, such issue is decided on the side of Satan. That being true, there is but one possible result for them. (Ps. 145:20) Jehovah gives his promise that, regardless of all persecution, lying and malicious slander that may be heaped upon God’s people, he will preserve those that are faithful and that love him, and hence they need not fret themselves concerning what others do to them.—Ps. 37:1-6. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Those who have once been made righteous and who then become fearful and faint-hearted will not continue in the warfare and will not be of the kingdom. Such the Lord tells to go back home and quit the fight. The faint-hearted are looking too much to self and for the approval of men, and not looking wholly to the Lord. Doubtless Paul had in mind the dangers lurking in the way, particularly with reference to selfishness and faint-heartedness, when he wrote to the people of God: “Let us not be [fainthearted, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font9"> in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.” (Gal. 6:9) The faint-hearted have removed from them by the Lord the opportunities of serving him, just as the faint-hearted among the Israelites were directed to go to the rear. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The greatest fight of all time is beginning and within a very short time will reach the climax. This fight includes the remnant, but it is Jehovah’s fight. He is “Jehovah of hosts” and therefore the remnant are absolutely assured that Jehovah’s organization will triumph. Satan and his forces are desperately attempting the destruction of all those who take a positive stand on the side of God and righteousness. The remnant are in the van of Jehovah’s people on earth and are singing Jehovah’s praises and should expect to be assaulted by the enemy. Without a question of doubt all the remnant would be destroyed instantly except for the protection the Lord throws around them. In this hour of great peril Jehovah speaks to his people and says: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/33</span></p>

The Lord’s people themselves will first have a full understanding and then all round about shall see the glory of the Lord. The “great multitude” class went into captivity during the World War, and the reason for their captivity must be made known. Had they stood firm for God and been unwillingly taken into captivity, as the remnant was, they would have been released; but because they held on to Satan’s organization they must suffer tribulation.

<p><span class="font9">The fact that a man is used by the Lord to write down the words of truth is no reason whatsoever to give credit to the man for that message of truth. If Satan can turn men’s minds to the point of giving honor and glory to men who thus write or who are supposed to write down the message, he will succeed to that degree in casting reproach upon the name of the Most High. The faithful remnant must and will learn to cease for ever from the foolish course of exalting men because of some work done by man as the instrument of God. Whoever the Lord uses is merely an integral part of Jehovah’s great organization, and all honor and credit is due to Jehovah, and none to man. It would be impossible to be wholly devoted to Jehovah God and to take any other course than giving honor and glory to God. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/32</span></p>

Jehovah’s mighty hand of protection is over his remnant while they utter the words he has placed in their mouths. This is another rebuke to the “wild beasts”. The worst rebuke to them, however, will be administered at Armageddon, when their rebuke will be lasting.

The time must come when he would have his name placed where it properly belongs before all creation. His name must be proclaimed throughout the earth, because God says: ‘I have permitted Satan to remain, that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’ This must be done in God’s due time, and that due time has arrived.

The faithful remnant on earth are gathered together in Christ. It is the day of Jehovah and the time for his name to be made known and to be properly placed before all creation. He will vindicate his own great and holy name, and therefore the “dispensation” or “administration” of the fullness of times is in the hands of Jehovah himself. Now he sends forth all who are in Christ to give notice that shortly he will vindicate his name. The administration of this work will be to his glory and to the praise of the Most High.

The work performed by Jehu which forshadows the part performed in antitype by the remnant is that of declaring the judgments of Jehovah.

They all hold fast their allegiance to Christ Jesus the King. Being Jehovah’s witnesses under Christ Jesus’ leadership, together with him they advertise the King and his kingdom.

When the Israelites were faithful and obedient to God he protected them from their enemies and fought their battles for them, and that he did for his own name’s sake, because he had placed his name upon that people. The lesson that the antitypical Israelites, God’s chosen people, get from this is that Jehovah’s purpose toward his people is certain to be carried out and cannot fail towards those who are in a covenant with him and who continue faithful.

The “dispensation of the fulness of times” refers to the administration of the work that must be done when the time comes for the gathering together unto Jehovah of all in Christ that these might perform the work Jehovah has provided for and committed unto them. Such “fulness of times” dates from the time the Lord Jesus comes to the temple of Jehovah. At that time Jehovah gathers unto himself the faithful, first, those who are in heaven, and then the faithful remnant on earth, into one body in Christ Jesus, and all together constitute the ‘elect servant’ of which Christ Jesus is the Head.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is over his organization, and of every one whom he saves and receives as a member of that organization he requires obedience. His word is law to all who love him, and his approval is given only to those who do obey his law. When he says in his Word that he requires of creatures to “walk humbly” before him, that means that the one who receives a knowledge of God is in duty bound to do what God commands. Man’s responsibility before God is according to his knowledge of God’s will. Only those who are diligent to obey God’s voice shall abide in his temple. One may be pursuing an unlawful way because of ignorance, but upon learning the truth the obligation is upon him to obey it. Those who diligently seek to know and understand God will reward by opening their understanding. Then their responsibility increases and they are obligated to obey. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 201</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It is “in that day”, which is the day or period of time after the opening of the temple, that Jehovah specially manifests himself to his children. His people are first made to have an understanding of the meaning of his name Jehovah, and then they are given an understanding that it is Jehovah that speaks to them. To the children of Zion, his sons by his “woman”, he makes known the meaning of his name, and teaches them. Today the children of Zion need no extraneous proof that the spiritual food and understanding of the prophecies they have comes from God. They know that no man or men could provide such food. No man or men on earth attempt to lay claim that any of these truths proceed from man. God has spread his table bountifully for his people, and the children of his woman feed thereat.

The facts show that it was fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem before Ezekiel got his temple vision about which he prophesied. God’s people, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, therefore could not expect to get a full understanding until God’s due time, and they could not expect to get an understanding of all of his truth at one time. When that understanding is given to them they know that it comes from the Lord, and not from man.

Now God’s remnant must proceed on the journey through this desert condition and must proceed on the highway provided by the King Eternal for them, which ‘highway is cast up’ for their benefit; and in due time all others of the human kind that live everlastingly must go up on that highway.

Jehovah’s witnesses form a part of the anointed and elect “servant” of God and they have a part in this work by means of the radio message and millions of books, and house-to-house testimony work, in which the remnant is now engaging.

Their offspring or seed picture ‘the seed of the Serpent’, which must be destroyed because anti-God, anti-Christ and anti-kingdom. The work of Jehu pictures Jehovah’s procedure in destroying that which has brought depravity upon the human race and dishonor upon Jehovah’s name. The chief development leading up to the slaughter work done by Jehu was Baal worship, which is Devil worship. The name Baal means “to be master; hence, to marry, to be the husband and, figuratively, the owner”. Baal worship therefore appears to be the worship of the Devil by joining the organization of which the Devil is master, husband and owner, and by accepting him, the Devil, as lord and head.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah by his prophet definitely states that when Jesus Christ appears at the temple he applies the final and decisive test and selects the approved or righteous, “that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” No one is righteous within himself. The judgment of the Lord determines who is righteous. Those who under the decisive test prove that they love Jehovah God as he has commanded are brought by the Lord under the robe of righteousness, which denotes their being approved. These are brought into the temple and builded up in Zion. It is out of Zion that Jehovah shines. The remnant of Zion now on earth must show forth Jehovah’s praises and therefore must shine forth as his witnesses.

These persons of good will, the Jehonadab class, learn that Jehovah is the only true God and the only power that can deliver them from their oppressors. The Lord Jesus is now at the temple of Jehovah for judgment, and the peoples of the world must be informed of that fact.

<p><span class="font9">&quot;Organized Christianity,” so called, falsely takes the name of Christ and then devours up men and oppresses mankind.

<p><span class="font9">This command shows that the Elisha work is directly related to the execution of the enemies of Jehovah. Elisha was anointed to finish the work Elijah had begun, and hence his was an ambassadorial or witness work also. Jehu pictures an execution or destructive work for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Elisha also foreshadows a vindication work, showing that the same persons connected with the Elisha work are likewise connected with the Jehu work. Elisha was anointed long before Jehu received his anointing ; which shows that the witness work must be done first and must then be followed by the work of destruction, even as shown by the ninth chapter of Ezekiel. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 15, 16</span></p>

Those faithful men in the apostle’s day were laying the foundation of Christianity among the people. Today the judgment of all professed Christianity is on. It is the day of the vengeance of our God against all workers of iniquity. It is the day in which he will vindicate his name, and our part therein is to declare his truth. No one can today prove his faithfulness to God and maintain his integrity toward God unless he boldly takes his stand on God’s side and fearlessly and boldly speaks the truth, and thereby proves that he is of the class that compose God’s faithful and true witness, the “servant” class now on the earth.

While reproached and humiliated by Satan’s organization, to the faithful remnant there comes the silver of divine truth and the gold of divine approval. The glory of Jehovah is upon his faithful remnant. His beloved Son covers the remnant with the robe of righteousness and provides the garments of salvation. But when the kings of Satan’s armies are put to flight, and God openly manifests his favor upon this little company of faithful witnesses, then such will have that beautiful appearance likened unto the wings of a dove covered with silver and her pinion feathers with green-shimmering gold. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/32</span></p>

The reason therefor is, many have professed to be the servants of God and have been unfaithful and have misused their privileges and caused confusion amongst those who might hear.

<p><span class="font9">The enemy’s coming against God’s people in “the latter days” is when the Lord is giving prosperity to his people. Jehovah is the protector of his remnant. Hence Gog’s moving against the remnant forces God right into the fight, because God and the remnant are inseparable. The enemy is touching the “apple of his eye”, and hence the fight follows. Gog and his coconspirators do not believe that Jehovah God is the Supreme One, and that the remnant have his protection, and hence conclude to rid the earth of this ‘pestiferous company’ called “the remnant”. The occasion of assault by this mighty army of Gog will be the occasion for God to sanctify his name and to vindicate it, which he will do. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 327, 328</span></p>

The members as a whole stand for or represent all those who died faithful and who have been resurrected to glory and also the remnant on the earth who have been brought into the temple and who continue faithful unto death.

Jehu was an executioner. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great Executioner. Jehu did his work with haste and without halting. The Lord Jesus does likewise.

Manifestly the purpose of Jehovah is to set the truth in the earth while his remnant or faithful servant is still on the earth, and that the truth must be told by his anointed remnant to the glory and praise of his great name. It does not seem reasonable that Jehovah would permit the last members of his church to die or be translated from earth to heaven while evil men speak in the name of God and declare error to the dishonor of his name. It seems far more reasonable that God would have some one class distinctly marked as his witnesses, and that at the very end of Satan’s organization.

(Vs. 10) By his prophet Jeremiah God declares that all nations of earth shall be made desolate, and this includes Egypt. (Jer. 25:15-26) It includes the king of Egypt and his servants. Satan’s organization, particularly its commercial part (Egypt), shall be completely wiped out, and Jehovah shall be known. V </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">II, 123</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The prophecy shows Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great executive officer, taking captive Satan and his cohorts at the battle of Armageddon. Those taken prisoners at Armageddon will not be preserved as such, alive in a prison house, but will be put to death and thus held captive in death until the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ. Doubtless Satan’s cohorts, and Satan himself before death at Armageddon, will come to a full realization that they are “all done up” and that the fight must put an end to the operations of Satan and his organization, who for centuries has been unhindered in his defiance of Jehovah God. Satan will be led in a procession of captives taken by Christ Jesus, and all the universe will see his shame and degradation. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/32</span></p>

No one who has received a knowledge of God’s purposes, and hence a knowledge of present truth, and then fails or refuses to participate in giving the testimony to the name of Jehovah, could possibly be of the kingdom of God. Let all lukewarm and negligent ones, and who are indifferent, take warning. The time is here in which God will have his name proclaimed; and in order for his anointed to maintain their integrity, and prove their faithfulness and love for Jehovah, they must and will proclaim his name.

<p><span class="font9">Those who love God will now stay clear of Big Business and devote themselves exclusively to the kingdom and will do “this one thing”. Some who heard the call to the kingdom committed the fatal error of going after wealth and riches and were ‘drowned in the sea’. “But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” (Vss. 9,10) Those who have made a covenant with the Lord, and then become negligent of it and become entangled with Big Business, will lose not only their earthly possessions but their hope of life everlasting. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 76</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Now Jehovah has brought his faithful remnant into the temple, given to them the garments of salvation, and brought them under the robe of righteousness, and has given them “a new name, which the mouth of the Lord [has named] ’ ’. They must now be entirely devoted to Jehovah and must proclaim his praises while giving proclamation concerning the judgments of Jehovah written against his enemies. These faithful ones of the remnant have in their hands the Word of God, which is a sword, and they must wield that sword of truth with force and effect. In this the remnant have a part in the Jehu work by virtue of being in Christ and being a part of Jehovah’s “servant”. It is now the day of Jehovah’s vengeance, and he commands his faithful remnant to declare his truths to the nations of the world. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 61</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">To the twelve apostles the kingdom interests and privileges on earth were originally committed, and now these kingdom interests and privileges are committed to the “faithful and wise servant”, which is the remnant of spiritual Israel. These are the people of God, and to his name they bear witness. These have obeyed the commandments of the Lord and have become his people. (2 Cor. 6:17,18) These are the people of God whom he has made his witnesses and named them such. (Isa. 43:10-12) They are the last members of Christ on earth, hence “the feet of him”, and they say to each other in Zion: “Thy God rcign-eth!” (Isa. 52:7) Jehovah has committed a work to them, putting his words in their mouth, and says to them: “Thou art my people.”—Isa. 51:16.

<p><span class="font9">The prayer of Jesus was that ‘all be made one’, that is to say, be brought to full unity, “that the world may know that thou hast sent me.*” How could this be accomplished except a witness be given, as Jesus has commanded ? This is in full harmony with the inspired words of Paul, who wrote that Jesus ascended on high and gave gifts in order to fully equip his people for the work of service. Why equip them for service unless they serve? Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Witness, and he declared that “every one that is of the truth heareth my voice”; and his voice at this time specifically commands the giving of the witness, which means that every one of the remnant must be a witness to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font9">Daniel’s faith and confidence were wholly in God. Instead of trying to shield himself and to salve his own conscience by praying in secret, he would have everybody know that he was putting his trust in Jehovah, and him alone. Therefore three times each day he kneeled down by his open window and presented his petition of supplication to Jehovah God. He did not fear any part of the Devil’s organization, nor his own reputation amongst men; nor did he fear the wild beasts when doing his duty to the Lord God. He feared and trusted Jehovah. For violating the unchangeable law of the “ruling powers’’ he was cast into the lions’ den. Jehovah God stopped the mouths of the lions and delivered Daniel. It was Daniel’s uncompromising devotion and faithfulness to God that brought about his approval and deliverance. W</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">This of necessity must apply after Jehovah builds up Zion and thus appears in his glory and in his organization. Jehovah declares (vs. 1) that he takes positive action for Zion’s sake, that he will make known that Zion is his organization and that the nations must come to see this. It must therefore take place before the destruction of the nations. Members of God’s organization and which, of course, are approved by him are likened here to a lamp or torch that is lighted and lifted high and points the people to the way of salvation. Therefore Jehovah God gives to his people a new name. The nations, particularly of “Christendom”, are now beginning to see that such are a “peculiar people” and unhesitatingly exalt the name of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font9">There is no room for discussion about what is the will of God at the present time. He places upon his anointed ones the obligation of being his witnesses and bearing the testimony before “Christendom”, to tell “Christendom” what is immediately about to come to pass. No excuse could be made that would warrant God’s witnesses in failing to give such witness. Jehovah has caused the way to be prepared for sueh work; he has provided the radio and the printing presses to prepare the message; he has caused his lightnings to shine clearer than ever before and thus causes the message to be made so plain that it can be understood; and then he says to his people: ‘ Go and tell this message unto Satan’s organization until it is wasted and made utterly desolate.’ Jehovah’s commandments must be obeyed, and those who love him will obey.

<p><span class="font9">According to that covenant the Lord now sends prosperity to his people in their work and protects them and safeguards them from the old Dragon. Jehovah will for ever give prosperity to his kingdom class and they will be at peace in Christ and in God’s organization. This covenant of prosperity is identified with the “everlasting covenant”, “even the sure mercies of David”; it includes the extraordinary goodness of God. Furthermore, there shall be no more captivity or exile of God’s people. God’s sanctuary, “trodden under foot” during the World War, shall be vindicated.

<p><span class="font9">The anointed remnant now say: “In the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.” (Isa. 26:4) Those who are wise ascribe all strength and power unto the Almighty God. “Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength,” (Ps. 29:1) How unwise, how very foolish, are those who claim to know and to love God, and who then persist in giving honor and praise and exaltation to men! It is Jehovah God who gave the word, and he feeds his people upon food that is convenient for them. Let none of God’S people be now given to foolishness. This is a time for serious study and action concerning God’s Word. Those in the past who have fallen because of pride or exaltation of men should be of sufficient notice to all who now claim to be serving God to walk before him in meekness and humility. Jesus refused to give anyone, aside from Jehovah, credit for the truth. All of the faithful ones will now do likewise. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The enemy conspires to come up against God’s organization, and Jehovah permits him to do so, and His permitting the remnant to witness the fight will cause them to more fully appreciate Jehovah’s great victory, the vindication of his name, and their own deliverance. When the enemy comes up God’s people are apparently unprotected; and if this were not so it is not likely that the enemy would have been so eager to make the attack, nor would the anointed of God’s people have had such a great opportunity of fully trusting him.

<p><span class="font9">The Lord Jehovah emphasizes the supreme importance of this commandment, adding: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” (Deut. 6:6-9) Further emphasis is given to this commandment by Jesus when he said: “This is the first and great commandment.” (Matt. 22:38) “This do, and thou shalt live.” (Luke 10:28) Thus Jehovah informs his intelligent creatures that if they would live they must love him. He is the Law-giver and the Giver of life. He gives life to those who willingly obey his commandments. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/31</span></p>

Today Jehovah’s witnesses go right into the midst of organized religionists that worship Satan and give a warning to those who claim to worship the Lord, in order that no one may be forgotten or left there without a warning. This warning is given by carrying the message of truth to the people and calling upon the people to take their stand upon the Lord’s side or upon the Devil’s side. This was particularly begun on July 26, 1931, with the adoption and publishing of the resolution “Warning from Jehovah” at the Columbus convention.

At or immediately preceding the inauguration of the new covenant that which the people will behold will be equally terrible as or even more so than that at Mount Sinai. The time must come when the peoples of earth will realize that Jehovah is the only true God. Then the enemies of God shall know that he is Jehovah. The rulers of the earth must go down, and they will know immediately before this takes plae’e that the hand of God is pulling them down. The organization which Jehovah will bring against the enemy is compared by Ezekiel to the “worst of the heathen [nations]”.

<p><span class="font9">The engraving on The Stone must mean Jehovah’s ineffaceable mark and declaration of his approval of it and his authorization for Jesus Christ to act for him as his great High Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Thus Jehovah seals The Stone as the Head Stone of his organization, pictured in the temple building. There is therefore no excuse for any creature in the universe to reject Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s King and rightful Ruler of the earth. The “eyes” on the Stone suggest that the Bible prophecies would all focus on Christ Jesus and his kingdom and that there would be a revelation thereof to and an understanding of these prophecies by the remnant (Joshua) and that they would be required to give a world-wide proclamation thereof. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 150</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">This is positive proof that God’s remnant are no longer to be left in doubt as to the food they are receiving, but will know (and they do know) that it is coming from the Lord’s hand. “The fat and the strong” means the self-satisfied feeders and self-important ones who use their power to boss and crowd on the side and hold in restraint their weaker brethren. Now the Lord feeds them with the justice that is due them for their improper course. Those who do not respond to the Lord’s chastisement or correction will be destroyed. God will not permit amongst his “servant” class any bosses or any who will lord it over his flock and maltreat them. The Lord will see that his people receive justice.

Such people must be his witnesses and his representatives on the earth. These are chosen, not because they are by nature better than others, but because they constantly resist everything that is anti-God and anti-kingdom. Not only do they resist, but they take a positive and unequivocal stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. They aggressively press the battle against Satan, his false teachers, and false doctrines, and refuse to make any compromise with Satan or his organization, and refuse to ask or to give any quarter.

That time the Prophet Joel describes as “the great and the terrible day of Jehovah”, and it must be so. Habakkuk gives a description of Armageddon, which shows that the people will look upon it with indescribable terror. Moses was terrified at what his eyes beheld at Sinai.

For six thousand years faithful men had waited for that time, and now it has come. “Gospel” means good news. Therefore the commandment specifically given to the faithful “servant” of the Lord applies from and after the year 1918, when he came to his temple; and from that time to this present day these faithful ones have heard and obeyed the command. Every one who truly loves God proves that love by joyfully keeping his commandments. And since this commandment is given by the Chief Officer of Jehovah, it is God’s commandment.

Let the world and all of the enemy organization think of God’s people what they please. That is immaterial. The day is not far distant when all will come to know that God has had on the earth at this time a class of men and women who are his faithful and true witnesses and who have not shunned to declare the truth, and who have thus maintained their integrity toward God. The weak and perverse will criticize now, and do so; but you be sure to take the course of action that will call forth God’s approval.

<p><span class="font9">Prior to the Lord’s coming to the temple his people were mixed up with others and were therefore unclean. The Lord brought them into the temple and under the robe of righteousness, and gave them the garments of salvation, thereby approving them and identifying them as his people, and thus he took away their uncleanness. “Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52:11) Jehovah’s witnesses now enjoy the increase of corn (wheat) which in the language of prophecy means an abundant supply of spiritual nourishment from God’s Word. There is no famine amongst his people and they can boldly testify to others concerning the truth.

To Tyre, both ancient and modern, it was prophesied: “Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.” (Ezek. 27:26) The “east wind” that breaks Tyre in the midst must refer to the power of Christ, the King from the sunrising, to whom is given all power in heaven and in earth.

<p><span class="font9">At the time when Jehovah will vindicate his name he sends forth his people whom he has taken out for his name and commands such to be his witnesses, telling them that he is the only true God; that he has put his name upon these and thus he has furnished them a special fortress of refuge. These constitute the remnant and are the special objects of Satan’s wrath. But they bear the name of Jehovah signifying his purpose toward them, and they need not fear. To them Jehovah says: ‘Fear not the enemy. You are my witnesses, and you go forth by my appointment. ’ It is by the name “Jehovah of hosts”, meaning the God of successful battle, that he here reveals himself to his anointed people and informs them that they are in his protection; and thus he gives to them consolation and full assurance.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 2:17, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus said to his faithful disciples: “I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33) Surely the remnant must be overcomers of the world, and this they must do by showing complete fidelity and devotion unto God and to his kingdom. Therefore overcoming should not be limited to the victory over death and the elevation of the creature to immortal glory. At least a part of it must be done while on the earth. It is these overeomers of Satan’s organization whom God makes his representatives on the earth, giving to such class his vote of approval, as pictured by the white stone, and making them a part of his official organization, and his witnesses on the earth.

<p><span class="font9">The faithful witnesses of Jehovah are now engaged in the publication of the name of Jehovah and of his kingdom; and they go throughout the land, declaring this unto the people, that “ Christendom ”, foreshadowed by Bashan, is not God’s choice for his kingdom or dwelling place, because “Christendom” has been rejected; but that Jehovah has chosen from out of his universal organization (pictured by Mount Zion) The Christ; and that Christ, God’s chosen One, is therefore earth’s rightful Ruler. Jehovah will now have the people to know the truth, which is that he is the supreme God and his kingdom is the hope of the world, and this information is given to the common people that they may have the opportunity to flee from Satan’s organization and take their stand on Jehovah’s side and receive that which he has prepared for those that love him. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Justice requires the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. It is not justice, but mercy, that restores the captivity of God’s covenant people. For his own name’s sake Jehovah will not suffer the enemy to triumph over those who have made a covenant with him, nor over those who because of fear have fallen away to the captivity of the enemy. The tribulation coming upon the “great multitude” will afford them an opportunity to prove their loyalty to God, and then he will wipe away their tears. They shall then know fully that Jehovah is the great God, their true and everlasting Friend, and that he has done all this work for his own holy name’s sake. All must come to know that God permitted the “great multitude” to go into captivity and then delivered them for his own name’s sake. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 346, 347</span></p>

The greater part of that militant army is invisible to human eyes, but on the earth there is a company that is counted in as a part of his organization, which people he designates as his remnant. In due time every human creature that gets life everlasting must come unto God’s organization and join themselves to it. They must march upon the way of righteousness. As Jehovah is now marching his forces to Armageddon, and the remnant is the only part of his organization on the earth wholly devoted to him, it follows that the remnant must be at the front, lifting high the standard of the Lord that others of good will may find the way to salvation. 17 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/31</span></p>

They have been duly warned to keep themselves separate from the world and to prove their faithfulness and love for God. They have been told that friendship with the world and mixing up with worldly schemes is an abomination in God’s sight. The people of “Christendom” who have covenanted to do the will of God have in the aggregate been unfaithful to God and have turned away to Satan’s organization, but at the same time there have been a few who have maintained their integrity and remained faithful and true.

To those who compromise with the enemy, Jehovah by his prophet says: ‘ ‘ Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.” (2 Chron. 19:2) There are those who have taken the name of God and his Christ and yet oppose the work now of publishing the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Those who are at full unity in Christ are pictured by the psalmist, therefore, as now saying: “For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.

<p><span class="font9">Ezekiel was not to utter a “wail” out of sympathy for Satan’s organization, but to deliver in a wailing tone this prophecy. Ezekiel was used, not for violence against Egypt, but to prophesy; and in this prophecy he should wail, “and say that it shall go down.” (Leeser) Appropriately Jehovah’s representative speaks ironically of the funeral of Satan’s organization. Even so now the Ezekiel class utters the wail for the enemy organization because at the final funeral of Satan and his “big guns” there will be no clergymen present to extol the greatness of those that lie in hades. Jehovah’s witnesses see what God will bring to pass by Christ Jesus, and they tell others about it, even before the actual funeral of Satan’s crowd takes place. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 188-192</span></p>

If they mean to take their stand on the Lord’s side they must completely sever their connection with the beastly rule and, as in the case of the beheading of the seventy sons of Ahab, Satan’s organization must become to them as dead. Their allegiance to his organization must cease, and must be given to the Lord. This course they must take if they would receive the protection of the antitypical Jehu, Christ Jesus, who will execute Jehovah’s judgments at Armageddon. The heads over the divisions of Satan ’s organization will be broken by the great Executioner, Christ Jesus.

The ruling powers of the world refuse to heed this warning and will not join in the song of praise to Jehovah. The Lord clearly shows his people in advance what shall come to pass. Therefore they know that this work of delivering the testimony and warning is not done according to the wisdom of man, hut is commanded and directed by the Lord and must he done according to his will. The faithful remnant delight in doing it, because it is the expressed will of God and because it looks to the vindication of his name.

Because they joyfully submit themselves to God’s beloved King they are permitted by his grace to fulfil the prophecy of Psalm 110:3: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning.” They having responded to the Lord’s call and devoted themselves wholly to his cause, he makes with them “an everlasting covenant”, “even the sure mercies of David.” (Isa. 55:3) By the grace of God these become members of The Christ and a part of Jehovah’s “Servant”.

If faithful in the performance of their divinely given commission the remnant shall “keep my courts”, which means they shall be kept in the temple while on the earth and eventually be given a permanent place in the “mansions” above and “shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge”. (Ezek. 44:15,16) Then says the Lord to the remnant: “I will give thee places to walls among these that stand by,” that is to say, with the great Angel, Christ Jesus, and the retinue of his holy servants. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 145</span></p>

Everlasting strength is therefore exercised in their behalf. Let it be remembered, however, that Jehovah is not taking this action in behalf of the remnant because the remnant are of intrinsic value and bring value to him. Jehovah is so exercising and continuing to exercise his power in behalf of the remnant for his own name’s sake. It is the time for the vindication of his name. No longer shall his name be dragged in the dust. He will now vindicate it that all may know that he is the only true God. Having purposed it, he will accomplish his purpose.

At Mount Sinai he inaugurated the law covenant which was typical. The antitype is the inauguration of the new covenant, which takes place at Mount Zion and which is performed by the Lord “in the holy place”, the sanctuary or temple. At the inauguration of the law covenant God stood on Mount Sinai and performed his wonderful and terrible acts. “And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake.” (Heb. 12:21) This shows that the great battle of Armageddon precedes the inauguration of the new covenant; therefore Jehovah marches to war with his “thousands upon thousands” of chariots of war.

Judas must have represented that class which starts to follow Christ Jesus and to bear some fruits but which ceases to bring forth the fruit of the kingdom. The suckers or hangers-on never did bear any fruit, but the branches performing proper functions must bear some fruit. The suckers are chopped off, while the branches are completely destroyed.

<p><span class="font9">The Lord is with his ambassadors or witnesses in their ships or organizations who are doing an organized and orderly service in the name of Jehovah. It is therefore certain that those who oppose these ambassadors who are giving testimony are opposing Jehovah God. The hireling strong-arm military squad (modern Ethiopians) of Big Business, who oppress the people and persecute and arrest and maltreat God’s people, have been and are bold-faced against the Lord and rely upon Satan’s organization for protection, but even these show in their faces some dread when laying hold upon God’s witnesses. The testimony of the truth when stated to them frightens them. Fear has taken hold upon them because of what they may lose, but they do not fear God or give allegiance to him. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 137</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Those who love Jehovah are not looking for the approval of men, but are diligently engaged in bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom with an unselfish desire to see God’s word and name completely vindicated, knowing that, this done, then the people in general will have a chance to know and obey God. The remnant of God’s organization, engaged in his work and doing it, draw the fire of the enemy upon them, and Satan and his agents conspire to destroy God’s “servant”. But for the comfort and assurance of his “servant” the Lord causes him to speak with confidence the above promise in his Word. All of the remnant love God, because when any cease to love him they are not of the remnant. All those who love God and continue to prove it by an unselfish devotion to him are certain to be preserved. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The glory Jehovah will get will be his victory over this powerful advertising instrument (Zidon) in Satan’s wicked organization. When Jehovah’s judgments are executed against Satan’s organization, Big Business will no longer be able to hide from the people the fact that Jehovah is the only true God and his kingdom is the one and only hope for the world. They will no longer be able to use the public press to blind the people. The Lord God is now proceeding with the publication of his message of truth. His purpose is that those who handle the public press, as well as others, shall know he is the Almighty One. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">VII, 110</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“The mystery of God” clearly means the revelation to his anointed ones of his purpose which he had purposed in himself. Seeing now that the all-important thing is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and that his Word and his name must be exalted, we can see that the salvation of man is merely incidental to the far greater work of vindicating Jehovah’s name. The ransom sacrifice is not most important. It is absolutely necessary, of course, to man’s salvation, but the vindication of the great Jehovah’s holy name is of far greater importance than all creatures. The “fulness of times” corresponds exactly with “that day” and “the day of Jehovah”. It is that period of time in which Jehovah gathers together his faithful ones unto himself and makes them members of his royal house.

<p><span class="font9">Jehu was not boasting of his zeal. His words therefore merely mean that he was going to accomplish God’s purpose, and he invited Jehonadab to come and see that he would do it in the name of Jehovah and do it faithfully. This suggests that now the Jehu class are accompanied by a class of people of good will who go along with God’s organization but which people are not begotten or anointed of the holy spirit. Jehu was engaged in the slaughtering of the Devil’s worshipers, but was showing favor to all who took their stand on Jehovah’s side. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to declare that the day of Jehovah’s vengeance is at hand and to tell those who are meek and honest and who love righteousness to take their stand on the Lord’s side. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 81</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">When the Lord brought his people into the temple he said to them that henceforth they should not mingle with the unclean. God’s remnant then saw Zion as God’s organization and immediately entered upon the “highway” leading out of Babylon, bearing the vessels of the Lord. There were those who preferred to remain where they were and hold on to the unclean things. They remained unclean and are not permitted to travel upon the “highway” and return and come to God’s organization. Because of their unclean condition God will not permit them to get into his organization. Those who would bear the vessels of the Lord must separate themselves from Satan’s organization Babylon and thus be clean before they could travel over the “highway of holiness”.

<p><span class="font9">When Jehovah’s witnesses go forth with the message they should always bear in mind that the message is the Lord’s, and not man’s, and that it is the privilege and duty of these witnesses to speak only as the Lord dictates. Obedience to organization directions must be observed, and Jehovah is the Head over all of his great organization. Christ Jesus, the executive of Jehovah, is directing the course of the organization. Those who constitute God’s “watchman” must use the means God has provided for them with which to give the warning, and a failure so to do would mean death to the “watchman”. They must give the warning, but it is unprofitable for Jehovah’s witn esses to engage in a controversy with those who were once enlightened and who now openly oppose the kingdom proclamation. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 208</span></p>

Some of the consecrated have been drawn into deals with Big Business for pecuniary interest, which is always unprofitable spiritually to those seeking the Lord’s approval. To be sure, God’s people must come in contact with Big Business for the bare necessities of life; otherwise they must “go out of the world”.

Let no one of Jehovah’s witnesses become discouraged or faint-hearted. The greatest favor ever conferred upon creatures is to be faithful and true witnesses for Jehovah. This favor to us is greatly enhanced when we realize that God has chosen the weak things, which have nothing, that he might bring to nothing the things that now are. (1 Cor. 1:28) The time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The present work assigned to the “faithful servant” class, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, is to publicly proclaim his name and his kingdom.

Such Higher Powers consist'of Jehovah God, Christ Jesus, and others upon whom Jehovah has bestowed authority to act officially in his name.

God has planted his anointed people that his name may be glorified. No longer do they suffer themselves to be shamed by the enemy or to appear in an apologetic manner before any of the enemy’s representatives.

Are Jehovah’s witnesses actually violating the commercial laws of the land? They are not in the slightest degree. They are going from house to house preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, even as they have been commanded by Jehovah to do. Even if their thus preaching the gospel would constitute a technical violation of man’s law these witnesses of Jehovah would still be doing right as long as they are doing only what Jehovah God has commanded them to do.

Jehovah’s victory will bring him renown amongst the people such as never before known. It will be a great privilege then to be known as the people of God. It seems probable that the remnant and the faithful prophets of olden times then raised up will together organize and carry forward this work of cleaning up the earth. Even the passers-by shall join in the cleaning-up work. At the end of seven months search shall be made to see if everything has been cleaned up. Not one vestige of the enemy or the enemy organization shall be left to defile God’s holy place, the earth. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 341-343</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Zion is the name of God’s woman; and her children when born take the name of the mother, because these are the sons of God and, becoming a part of his organization, would bear the name of his organization. Hence they become a part of Zion. The words “taught of God”, therefore, must be and are limited to the children of Zion, and not to all who are begotten of the holy spirit. When the time arrived for Jehovah to build up Zion and for her to “obtain children” and to begin housekeeping (Ps. 113: 9), it follows that those who are not born in Zion could not become a part of the royal household or children of the organization and, that being true, they are not taught of Jehovah, within the meaning of the precious promise of the above text.

<p><span class="font9">“That land” pictures the condition of the faithful, and the Lord, by taking away their iniquity (as he did in 1919), has made them, the faithful remnant, to dwell in “the land shadowing with wings”. The brethren in Christ call to one another and encourage one another in the Lord’s service. The fig tree simply denotes the sweetness and fruitfulness of doing God’s will. The vine pictures the good cheer and joy of the kingdom service. (Judg. 9:11,13) Following the year 1919, when the Lord’s faithful “servant” class got busy with the kingdom work, the Lord prospered them and brought them “under the vine and under the fig tree”. Since then they have feared neither man nor devil, because they know they are right in advertising God’s King and kingdom. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 151,152</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">At Jesus’ ascent into heaven was not the due time for him to receive any as a gift except the obedient ones who would be his footstep followers, “the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb.” He must wait to receive the others of mankind, including the stubborn and rebellious ones, until this day. The rebellious are the gifts which are for the destruction, whereas the others of mankind are “vessels of mercy”. Even these gifts which Jesus now receives he in turn gives to his body members in that he guarantees them a part in the destruction of the rebellious ones. In due time the faithful will share with the Lord Jesus Christ in the privilege of blessing all the obedient ones of mankind, and therefore share in the gifts.

<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s people now on earth are joyful as one blessed with great prosperity. God’s service organization in the earth is thrilled -with joy. It is a time of feasting for them. They are feasting upon prophetic truths which the Lord has given to his people, and the remnant delight to have the privilege of singing the praises of Jehovah’s name. Thus they follow as a flock Christ Jesus their leader and they know that Jehovah is their God. The faithful are “come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God”, unto God’s organization, and their joy is great. Now they offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness and to his praise. Jehovah’s chariot is meantime moving majestically forward to the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 278</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jesus’ prayer proves beyond all doubt that the primary purpose of calling, instructing and forming the church is in order that those who are brought into God’s organization may be brought into complete unity with God and Christ and have some part in the vindication of the word and name of Jehovah. Such unity or oneness of God’s covenant people must be attained unto by the faithful remnant while on the earth that these may stand steadfast in Christ as faithful and true witnesses to God and to his kingdom, fully rooted and grounded in the truth, and together harmoniously give testimony to his Word and name. This unity with Christ must be in faith and in the knowledge of God and his kingdom, and thus these faithful ones are brought to the point of mature manhood in Christ, to the stature of the fullness in Christ.

<p><span class="font9">For some time the kingdom message was confined to the religious element. Beginning with 1931 the message of God’s kingdom as the only hope of the world has gone forth to nations never heretofore reached and the testimony has been given very thoroughly throughout “Christendom”, and particularly in the realms of the seventh world power. This prosperity and blessing on the part of God’s people raises the ire of the enemy and causes him to act. Gog fears for the League of Nations. Gog and his allies have become aware of the message of the kingdom by radio, which is reaching many countries and peoples, and aware also of the house-to-house testimony work which the remnant is doing. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 324</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">This deliverance, foreshadowed by Israel’s deliverance from Egypt, began after 1919, when God’s people saw the two great opposing organizations and took their stand wholly on the Lord’s side and became a part of his organization. The last members of the Christ body on earth are the remnant, and are undoubtedly represented here by “thy foot”; and this seems to be another indication that the faithful remnant, or at least some of them, will be on earth during the great battle of Armageddon and witness the blood that shall flow by reason of Christ Jesus’ executing the enemy. The remnant, seeing the vengeance of God manifested upon the enemy, will have further reason to rejoice and praise his name. At Armageddon great will be the actual flow of blood.

<p><span class="font9">The wall shows a clear line of demarkation between the holy and the profane, between things earthly and things heavenly. It is to keep out all that offend and that do things unlawfully. It protects against the invasion of the uncircumcised and the unclean. Jehovah has provided holy angels to serve and protect those on earth who are now devoted to him. The wall symbolizes such protection of angels in camping round about God’s people. Since it is the sanctuary class that is made exclusive, the beginning of the vision’s fulfilment is while God’s remnant are yet on earth, engaged in delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ. At such a time these witnesses need the divine protection against the assaults of Satan and his organization. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 195</span></p>

Even so today the peoples of good will who take their stand on Jehovah’s side, by associating with Jehovah’s witnesses in supporting them, let it be known by their course of action that they are against the organization of Satan. Jehovah’s witnesses now have the zeal like to that of Jehu and they should encourage the Jehonadab class to come along with them and to take some part in proclaiming to others that God’s kingdom is at hand.

This joy begins with such as soon as they come to know that Christ Jesus has taken his great power and begun his reign and that thus Jehovah is beginning his judgment upon Satan’s organization, and the establishment of his government of righteousness. The singers at the present time take on the form of a world-wide effort to show forth Jehovah’s praises and to testify to his name and to his mighty acts.

This is now being done “in the sight of the heathen”; because God’s remnant are neither keeping out of sight nor keeping their mouths closed, but they are constantly proclaiming the name and the praise of the Most High. Jehovah is now sanctified in them in that he has called them into his active service and they extol his name and declare his mighty works. The faithful remnant do now dwell in their land as given to Jacob, because they are God’s “servant” class, and are now dwelling in the condition pictured by the land shadowed with Jehovah’s wings.—Isa. 18:1,2. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 113</span></p>

He is The BRANCH of Jehovah as God’s “firstborn” and as his only begotten Son. The body members of Christ are branches of The BRANCH. To the faithful remnant on earth he is beautiful, the fairest of ten thousand, and “altogether lovely”, and he is appreciated in this day which Jehovah hath made. “In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped [the remnant] of Israel.” (Isa. 4:2) The remnant now on earth must and do gladly announce the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 147, 148</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">To bring about such unity a work must be done among those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. That this work might be accomplished Jesus Christ appointed and sent forth his apostles and also created the offices and prescribed the qualifications of prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers; but the office of elder he did not provide. This he did not do for the very manifest reason that all who come to the point of unity are elders in truth and in fact within the Scriptural meaning of that term. Such are mature men in Christ, and, to be sure, this maturity could not be advanced in any manner whatsoever by the vote of others. The offices provided for the benefit of the saints must be used for the purpose of bringing all Christ’s body members to maturity.

<p><span class="font9">Righteousness is counted unto men only who believe m God and in Christ Jesus and who then joyfully render themselves in obedience to the law of God. According to this rule the members of the remnant class are righteous. They have the name of Jehovah and his name is their strong tower. Truly, then, the righteous have hurried into this high tower. On July 26, 1931, at the Columbus (Ohio) convention, God’s people seeing and appreciating the fact that Jehovah had given to his people a new name, they joyfully accepted the same. They literally ran into that tower of everlasting strength. Not only did that convention adopt a resolution declaring their joy in the fact of having received their name at the mouth of Jehovah, but all over the earth faithful companies of God’s people hastened to thus declare themselves.

Let no one who is now of the remnant be induced to act foolishly by giving credit to any man or men for the message of truth that comes to the people of God.

<p><span class="font9">These words must refer to the remnant, anointed to the kingdom with Christ Jesus. The real temple of God was not set up until 1918, when the Lord Jesus came and the faithful sleeping saints were raised and brought into Zion, and the faithful ones remaining on the earth were also brought into the temple. From that time forward the praises of Jehovah must begin and be sung throughout the nations even within the hearing of the present rulers of earth. Such is the reason why the vigorous witness work began after 1918, and particularly from 1922 forward. Members of the faithful remnant class are in the covenant for the kingdom and are now bringing presents unto the Lord, in this, that they present themselves living sacrifices to bring honor and praise to the name and kingdom of the Most High.

<p><span class="font9">If the unclean are not permitted to pass over the “highroad of holiness’’, then surely the fools, perverse or bad persons would not get on it. The highway leads to Zion, which is God’s organization. “The Lord loveth the gates of Zion.” (Ps. 87:2) The angels of the Lord are the door or gate keepers, and these faithful officers will see to it that none enter upon the “highway” except in the right way, and clearly that way means that one must first be wholly devoted to God. This being true, then, the perverse fools would not be permitted to enter, neither will it be possible for them to “stray” into the “highway”. The guards will prevent them. As long as one is a fool he will not consent to walk in the “way of holiness”, which is the requirement concerning those who are admitted to the highway. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Let us bear in mind that God’s professed people, including many who were sincere, have profaned his name amongst the nations. Jehovah’s chief purpose is to sanctify his name. The restoring of his faithful remnant people to their proper position as his true and bold witnesses, and causing them to declare his name fearlessly and boldly, is for his own holy name’s sake and is for the vindication of his name. It is not for the benefit of the remnant, but it is that the name of Jehovah God may be made known and be put in its proper place in the minds of creatures that they may know that he is the Supreme One. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 267</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Nothing short of perfect love of man for his Creator God will prove or decide the question at issue in favor of Jehovah. If a man loves any thing or any creature more than he loves God, that would prove that the Devil had won the issue so far as that particular man is concerned. This proves that Jehovah gave the above commandment, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of his creatures. God is self-contained and would not need to take any such action for his own benefit. God will vindicate his word and name, and every man that remains true and faithful to God and thus maintains his integrity toward God will to that extent have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Man, taking this course, shall live and not die. The keeping of the commandment is therefore of the most vital importance to man. A failure to keep it means that man loses everything.

Jehovah is the great “well of salvation” out of which the Israel of God, the faithful servant class, now draw the waters of salvation. The elect servant is made up of Jehovah’s sons, who are members of the royal temple. This royal family is gathered into the temple. They are of Zion, and therefore they sing, “All my springs are in thee.” All in the temple celebrate the happy condition, and this they do by all speaking to the glory of God. There is no distinction now among those who are in the service of Jehovah, because all are together, acting as one, and all are one.

<p><span class="font9">More than sixty times Jehovah caused Ezekiel to use an expression like the above. All creation must know that Satan has reached his limit and now must go down. For the honor of his name and the good of all creation Jehovah will now teach all the reason why he has permitted wickedness to have a free hand in the earth and why the wicked must now be destroyed. The wicked one has budded up a powerful organization which no human agency could possibly destroy; but now the Lord God comes forward with war equipment which knows no defeat, and marches on to battle. The little earthly division of the Lord’s army is called “the remnant”, and each one therein is thrilled with the opportunity to have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s great name.

Arrests and persecution will continue against God’s people, but let none of the remnant for one moment be discouraged. While the witness work is going forward those of the enemy class, and who are the worshipers of Satan, are donning the garments by which they openly identify themselves as God's enemies. Thus they prepare themselves for destruction. The faithful remnant in bearing witness to Jehovah’s name will suffer inconvenience and probably much persecution, but these things will in no way deter them from the faithful performance of their commission in doing the work which God has given them to do.

<p><span class="font9">The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but, being the message of truth, are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds of wickedness. Jehovah has commanded his people to wield the weapons of warfare which he has placed in their hands. All those who will ever have God’s approval and be a part of the kingdom must have some part now in the warfare against the enemy. They must give notice and warning to the rulers and to the peoples of the world, and particularly to the religionists, of God’s purpose to destroy Satan’s wicked organization by his kingdom. There is no alternative. Failure to be obedient to God in this behalf will result in his disapproval and the loss of everything.

Many of the chief men therein have apparently come out of the world (Egypt), have associated themselves with the so-called “Christian church” and are made the “principal of the flock” by the clergy. These men are modern uncireumeised Philistines. God’s remnant have something to do with Jehovah’s judgment against modem Philistines, to wit, to serve notice upon such of and concerning God’s purposes and kingdom and to tell them his kingdom is at hand. This work is now in progress by the Lord’s faithful witnesses, and is for the sole purpose of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and hence that those upon whom notice is served may know that Jehovah is the only true God. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 49, 52</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The “another name” must be closely associated with Jehovah, because he gives it, and must be closely associated with Christ Jesus, because Jehovah is plainly declared to be the God of The Amen, by and through whom ‘those who bless themselves in the earth must be blessed’. One of the titles of the Lord Jesus Christ is “the Amen”. (Rev. 3:14) Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth to be his witness, and Jesus was entirely faithful in the performance of that work, and Jehovah gave him the name and title “The Amen, the faithful and true witness”. When Jesus goes into action against Satan’s organization he bears the title The “Faithful and True”. Those who are closely identified with him must be like him and bear his name. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">As in Ezekiel’s vision the Lord sends '‘six men” to do the slaughter work, so it appears that Jehu employed a company of eighty men to do the slaughter work upon this crowd and warned these men not to let a single one of the Baal worshipers escape. This shows that God’s purpose is to completely clean up the satanic worship in the earth. Jehu made it clear that there was to be no falling down or failure in the performance of duty, like as Saul had failed when he was commanded to slay the Amalekites. The device that Jehu employed definitely identified every Baal worshiper by letting them choose their own means of identification, which they did by putting on the Baal vestments. Every Baal worshiper was destroyed. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 88-91</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Because of his love for Jehovah Jesus repeatedly said that he came, not to do his own will, but to do the will of his Father who sent him. Jesus permitted nothing to cause him for one instant to flag in his uncompromising devotion to Jehovah God; and because of his loving devotion God gave to Jesus the highest place in his great organization. Those who shall be with Jesus Christ as members of his royal house must of necessity be put to a decisive test similar to his. It is the love of Christ, meaning the same kind of love that Christ has for Jehovah, that draws and holds together the members of the royal house in complete unity.

<p><span class="font9">In recent days the Lord’s Word concerning Jehovah and his kingdom has been presented to many of these “bulls”, particularly the clergy, as well as other “bulls” of Satan’s organization, and many of these bullheaded ones have stamped the truth literally under their feet. Like swine they have trampled under their feet the precious things of the Lord and then turned to rend Jehovah’s witnesses. While it would have been out of place before the Lord’s coming to his temple for any of the followers of Christ Jesus to cast the silver of truth before these “swine”, as it is now done, yet now is the day of the judgment of God. Christ is at his temple for judgment, and God had commanded that these “bulls” and “swine” must be served with notice of his purpose to rid the earth of them.

The operators of Big Business must be destroyed and multitudes of people on earth, who have been enslaved by this instrument of Satan, must be set free. Jehovah, by his Executive, will accomplish this, and the people shall know that it is Jehovah’s hand that did it. He will then bring peace to them. The streams of the people he will cause to flow peaceably to the kingdom, and there will be no more friction, but the people will flow together “like oil” (vs. 14).

<p><span class="font9">When Jehovah’s due time comes, which is necessarily “the fulness of times”, he brings all things which he has purposed into conformity to his will. Before restitution is accomplished all creation shall know that Jehovah is the almighty and only true God. The restoration of the human race will not bring the vindication of Jehovah’s name as contemplated by the Scriptures. Clearly, therefore, the “administration of the fulness of the appointed times” means Jehovah’s own due time, when he administers his affairs by and through Christ Jesus and in this administration or dispensation he gathers together in heaven all who are in Christ, and all who are in Christ on the earth, to wit, the remnant. This gathering together of all in Christ is for the very purpose of giving such an opportunity to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font9">A gate is a means of entrance to the house. It suggests that one desiring to enter must first learn the rules of entry, because promiscuous entry would not be permitted. This is proven by the fact that Jehovah’s angels guard the entrance to his royal house. The measuring of the threshold in Ezekiel’s presence would suggest to the Ezekiel class that they must be diligent to approach and to enter the gate and to do it according to the rules or measurements. “Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.” (Luke 13: 24) Everything earthly must be left behind by those entering at the temple gates. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 196,197</span></p>

The proper conclusion drawn from the words “his strength is in the clouds” or “in the skies” (7? </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V.)</span><span class="font9"> manifestly is that the great demonstration of Jehovah’s power will take place in the beclouded sides and will be seen by all creation.

Necessarily Armageddon must and will be such an open demonstration of Jehovah’s power that all creation may see and know that it is Jehovah God that is performing this wonderful and strange act.

The spirit of Christ .Jesus, the vindication of Jehovah’s name, is the spirit that moves God’s remnant; and this God has put upon them after they were brought into the temple and received the robe of righteousness. (Joel 2: 28, 29) Therefore these faithful ones “keep my judgments” and “my statutes” and “have the testimony of Jesus Christ”. Seeing the prophecy applies to them, the remnant are now comforted and their hope is made bright. The “great multitude” must be brought into this condition for the vindication of Jehovah’s name in his due time.

Therefore the name bestowed upon his faithful ones is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Often Jehovah has used his devoted people to fulfil certain portions of his prophecies, and then later revealed to them that they have been so used. It was in 1918 that the Lord Jesus began judgment at the temple of God. From that time forward the approved ones were brought into the temple and made the witnesses of Jehovah. It was at that time that the new name was given by Jehovah to his anointed ones, and all those who have been brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness have received that name, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” It was not until 1931, however, that Jehovah God made known to his people that he had thus named them.

The members of that royal house are limited in number, and every one must be an overcomer. Christ Jesus, the Head of that royal house, overcame the enemy, and every member thereof must do likewise. “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.” “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God.” The enemy and his organization will make a last and desperate stand against the organization of Jehovah, and will fail.

It is written: “For thou also hast wrought all our works in us.” Those who have responded to the call to the kingdom, and who have been favored with a knowledge of the kingdom and who then exercise common sense, will refrain from giving credit to men for the truth and the work done in connection therewith; and if such are truly and fully devoted to God they will give to Jehovah God all credit and honor for the truth and what it has accomplished.

Elisha did no actual bloody work. He did anoint Jehu to do that very work in his time, and therefore Elisha had a part in it. He survived Jehu, which seems to say that the Elisha work of giving testimony will continue after Armageddon.

God has gathered his anointed ones into their “home land’’, God’s organization, in order that they might be secure while delivering the message of his kingdom and serving notice upon the enemy nations. Even after Armageddon some of the remnant may be used for further fulfilment of this prophecy. Even now they know that they dwell in security in his organization and that his promised blessings to them are sure and true.

<p><span class="font9">After Jehovah’s witnesses have given their testimony as commanded by the Lord concerning “organized religion” they may leave their ease with him until he chooses to confirm the word of his servants. When God confirms their testimony by the fulfilment of the prophecy, such would then be a time to speak with more boldness and authority than ever before. But, as in Ezekiel’s ease (Ezek. 33:22), the Lord does not require his servants to wait until the confirmation fully arrives, to open the lips of his servants to be his witnesses, but when the prophecy is in fulfilment or is in course of fulfilment God opens their mouth and commands that speech be made.

On the contrary, there are myriads of heavenly companies that have remained true and steadfast, maintaining their integrity toward God from the time of antiquity, and these are in his army. Jehovah rides upon the heaven of the heavens, this meaning doubtless the capital or highest part of Jehovah’s organization, to wit, Christ Jesus, the King of glory. Jehovah rides upon all, because he is the Most High and because the Head of Christ is God. The voice of warning he sounds just preceding the great battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font9">Prior to the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of God and his gathering unto himself his faithful followers these were buffeted by and compelled to mingle with the unclean ones. Among them were the selfish and self-important ones who desired to shine and who were not clean before the Lord because of the wrong condition of heart. When Christ came to the temple and gathered God’s people unto himself they were brought into the secret place of the Most High, and concerning such God promised that they shall 'tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the dragon, and shall trample them under feet’. (Ps. 91:13) The remnant have Jehovah’s protection. Safeguarding the welfare of all those who are upon the “highway” the Lord says: “No lion [Devil or his representatives] shall be there, nor any ravenous beast [devilish organization] shall go up thereon.” W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Then the heathen, that are left round about you, shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the Lord have</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">spoken it, and I will do it.—Ezek. 36:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is Jehovah’s purpose in bestowing such blessings now upon his faithful remnants Is it for the remnant’s benefit? It is not; but that Jehovah’s name may be vindicated. The enemy cannot give credit to any part of Satan’s organization for the publishing and increase of God’s message of the kingdom, because no support is received or desired from any part of Satan’s organization. The Lord’s faithful people receive nothing therefrom. Jehovah God is rebuilding that which the enemy sought to tear down; and in his due time he will destroy the enemy and their organization to the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">VII, 276,277</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 30:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No one could understand concerning the two great organizations, God’s and Satan’s, until the temple of God was open. Only those who by God’s grace have been taken into the temple do now understand. These do not understand by reason of knowledge or wisdom that comes to them from any man, but they are taught of God, who teaches them the truth by and through the Head of the temple class, Christ Jesus. Why then should those today who really believe they are servants of God hesitate for one moment in determining the question concerning who gives them the doctrine of truth? Jehovah God is the great Teacher of his children. To be sure, these truths are published by imperfect men, and hence are not absolutely perfect in form; but they are put forth in such form as reflects the truth God teaches his children.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel.—Ezek. 35:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s purpose is that all shall know that he is the Almighty God. Because of their exhibition of malicious hatred Jehovah caused his judgment against such enemies to be written. He declares his purpose to administer just retribution upon those who have persecuted his anointed. Desolation shall be the portion of the “mount Seir” or Esau class, while all the peoples of earth who seek righteousness shall rejoice. “Thus saith the Lord God, When the whole earth re-joiceth, I will make thee desolate. As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: ... 0 mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (Vss. 14,15) This rejoicing shall follow the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 248-251</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not</span><span class="font9"> wani </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a man to stand before me for ever.—Jer. 35:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is a confirmation of the scriptures proving that millions now living will never die and shows that the Lord’s anointed have been right in declaring this truth. The Jehonadab class are meek, that is, teachable, and they seek to do right and are anxious for the kingdom to be established, and it is this class that Jehovah’s Word shows he will take through Armageddon. It is the Jehonadab class that are marked in their foreheads, and these are to be spared. It is a great comfort to Jehovah’s witnesses to now know that they are permitted to carry the waters of life to a class of people that may be taken through Armageddon and given everlasting life on the earth by reason of the bounteous goodness of Jehovah, even as the name Jehonadab suggests.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles; and they shall know that I am the Lord.—Ezek. 39: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The enemy Gog comes against God’s organization, symbolized by the mountains of Israel, and shall fall there. Jehovah awaits the attack, and thus he permits wickedness to come to the full and openly manifest itself. There upon the open field he makes an example of the enemy. It seems that some of the wicked angels are left behind in reserve and apparently in security. This supports the conclusion that “the land of Magog” is the realm of the invisible wicked hordes. It was there in the land of Magog that the conspiracy was formed, and now the Lord attacks the enemy’s base of operations, which would mean both the invisible apd the visible base for carrying on the wicked warfare against God’s organization. Thus these too shall be made to know Jehovah’s supremacy and allpower. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 336</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.—2 Ki. 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ai Mount Carmel Elijah had slaughtered four hundred and fifty of the priests of Baal. Jehu duplicated that slaughter work, only on a far greater scale. Jehu was a vindicator of Jehovah’s word in this, that he fulfilled the word of Jehovah spoken by his prophet Elijah against Ahab and Jezebel. He was anti-Jezebel and rode over her in utter contempt and trampled her to death. In this work he also completed that which Elijah had begun. Elijah had called down fire from heaven in the presence of the prophets of Baal and Ahab at Mount Carmel. His prayer was: “Hear me, 0 Lord, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Lord God.” That was a vindication of Jehovah’s reputation, but not sufficient to cause the reformation of Ahab and Jezebel. Baal worship continued, and the Lord used Jehu to vindicate his word and his name in connection with Baal worship. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.—Ezek. 37:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah will sanctify his faithful “servant” class unto himself and to his service; and the “servant” class, including the remnant, the people of God for his name, will sanctify the name of Jehovah for ever. It must become apparent to the peoples of earth that Jehovah has a people on earth who do not apologize for being on his side, and are not ashamed or even backward to own and confess his name, and the name of his beloved King, but who delight always to maintain their integrity toward God and to constantly proclaim his praises. Likely in the midst of Armageddon God will make it very manifest that he is for his remnant upon whom his name is placed and who are his witnesses. The nations, including God’s enemies, will be made to realize that Jehovah is God and he has set apart this people for himself. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 304, 307</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.—Ezek 33:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of their pride these do not learn by God’s Word or by experience that Jehovah is God, but by God’s judgment executed upon them they do learn and experience that he is the Almighty. Concerning these that are impressed with their self-importance God directed his prophet to say: “Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?” (Vs. 25) They overlook the conditions that attach to inheriting “the land” for ever. They are violators of their covenant ; and no violator of his covenant with God need think that he can continue as an heir of God’s promises and remain in God’s organization. He must be faithful to the Lord in order to obtain the promises. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 218-220</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God lays upon the shoulder of the remnant now the great privilege and obligation of tairing the lead in declaring his mighty works and in preparing the way for the people by lifting up to all order-loving ones the standard of Jehovah and showing them the “highway” that leads to God and eternal life. It is the privilege and duty of the remnant to show the people the wicked organization of Satan and to bid them to depart therefrom and become a part of God’s organization of righteousness. The gathering out of the stones is first for the benefit of the remnant themselves, that they may have a clear vision of God’s purposes, and then to show the truth to the people. Every member of the remnant will faithfully perform his duty. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The BRANCH.—Zech. 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Thy fellows” must mean the remnant on earth who are still faithful, because these are the fellows of the faithful ones who have been resurrected and the remnant must bear testimony to the fulfilment of what Jehovah is here announcing. The words “my servant, The BRANCH” mean Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s elect Servant. Therefore it is clearly seen that the words “Behold, I will bring forth my servant, The BRANCH” mean that Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Messenger, is brought to his temple. This clearly means that the “messenger of the covenant” is come into the temple and that all of Jehovah’s organization must take notice thereof and bear testimony concerning this great event. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V III, 146, 147</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, . . . and they shall call it, The valley of Hamon-gog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezek. 39:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Gog will not go away alive, nor will the dead have military burial with high honors, but they will be buried like brute beasts. The destruction of Gog’s army will be inglorious and odious and will be a vile stench in the noses of those who pass by, both literally and symbolically. There will not be any of Gog and his multitude left to do the burying. (Jer. 25:33) This shows that the bodies of the dead will be lying around on the ground. After the wild beasts, dogs and carrion birds have stripped their bones, then these bones will be gathered up and buried. The burying ground is called “The valley of the multitude of Gog”. It is not a place of wailing for “Adamic death”, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">testimony to God’s vindicated name and to the death of the enemy. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 340, 341</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Israel, saith the Lord God.—Ezek. 39:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This shows a very definite time at which God poured forth his spirit upon the whole house of Israel, and that time is stated by the prophecy of Joel 2:28, 29. This gushing forth of the holy spirit precedes Gog’s invasion of the land, to the end that Jehovah’s witnesses might, by God’s grace, give the warning and the testimony before the great battle is fought. God’s face for the time was apparently hidden from his true people, but the time must come when his face is turned towards them, Zion becomes fruitful, her children are brought forth and taught of God, and all have great peace and joy. “My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.” —Isa. 54:10.

<p><span class="font9">When the 144,000 reach the point of maturity, unity or oneness in Christ, that does not mean that the offices of the apostles cease, for the reason that they have other duties to perform. The same would be true with regard to the other offices provided for and to which appointments were made by the Lord. For instance, evangelists are preachers and are commissioned by the Lord to proclaim the message of his truth. The truth must continue to be proclaimed until every creature has an opportunity to receive a knowledge of it. The word “till”, as above used, must mean, therefore, that the duties of these offices must be performed or function in behalf of the 144,000 until the state of unity or oneness is reached. There must be no cessation until unity is accomplished. W </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">9/1J32</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">During the World War God’s professed people became subject to the enemy organization, not because their God was a myth or was too weak to cope with the enemy, but particularly because those going to make up the “great multitude” did not take a firm stand on the side of Jehovah. For this reason they must be compelled to go through tribulation and fall and go into captivity. All must yet come to know that God permitted the great multitude to go into captivity and then delivered them for his own name’s sake. They will also know that the treading down of God’s sanctuary class during the World War, and their subsequent deliverance, was by God’s permission that his name might be made known and vindicated. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 345-347</span></p>

The precious promises apply to them now while on earth faithfully performing the service the Lord has given into their hands. They are members of the “son of man”; therefore they are the Lord’s men and know that he is their God. They joyfully and unselfishly press on publishing the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">V II, 244</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The day approaches for the great fight, and Jehovah calls to his anointed remnant, which forms a part of his organization, and says: “Awake, awake, put on thy strength, 0 Zion.” Jehovah will give strength to his people. The faithful remnant are near the end of their earthly pilgrimage. Soon these shall see the manifestation of Jehovah’s power for the vindication of his name. The enemy is putting forth his greatest efforts against the remnant; and the apostle, looking down especially to this day, wrote concerning it: “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.” Those who remain true and steadfast and maintain their integrity toward God need have no fear, because his promise is: “ The Lord will give strength unto his people.”—Ps. 29:11.

<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Act of March 3, 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As far as Jehovah’s Word indicates to his witnesses, the due time to celebrate the Memorial in 1933 of our Lord’s death will be Sunday, April 9, after six p.m. Advance notice is here inserted that the members of Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’ in all parts of the earth may make due preparation to keep the feast in unity. The Society will be pleased to know the number participating. Company secretaries will oblige by notifying the Brooklyn office promptly after Memorial Pioneers in this country and isolated brethren should make reports to the Brooklyn office. Those in foreign lands will report to the branch office under whose supervision they work. Brethren residing in countries not under supervision of a branch should report direct to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REMNANT’S THANKSGIVING PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">April 8 to 16, inclusive, of this year has been set aside for Jehovah’s witnesses in every province of the earth to make a united effort in a special expression of thanksgiving unto the great bountiful Jehovah. The Memorial of our Lord Jesus’ death will be observed on the evening of the second day of this special period. This being a Sunday evening, it will allow for practically all the remnant to precede their partaking of the Memorial by witnessing in the field to the praise of His name all or the half-holiday part of Saturday and all of Sunday preceding the feast. If all the faithful members of Jehovah’s remnant everywhere will strive to do this, the number of those taking an active part in giving the testimony afield as compared with those celebrating the Memorial will be greater this year than for the corresponding period last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the week immediately following the Lord’s supper, all the remnant, with the Memorial blessings abounding in their hearts, will be privileged to redeem as much time as possible for publicly expressing from house to house their gratitude to Jehovah and thus share with the poor of this world the good things on which Jehovah has made his remnant to feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ORDERING FOREIGN-LANGUAGE LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some brethren in the United States and other countries sometimes believe it advisable to ship literature direct from themselves to parties in other countries. This is a very unwise practice, for the reason that it causes much trouble in getting the literature into the other countries and in many cases it is confiscated. We earnestly request that all the brethren refrain from this practice. If you desire some individual in another country to have the literature in a certain language, please send your order with remittance to the Brooklyn office, or to a branch office, so that it can be properly filled. Large supplies of literature in different languages are kept in all countries where there is a branch, and it is better for the branch office to fill orders for people residing in that country.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TESTIMONY OF JEHOVAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The testimony of Jehovah is sure.”—Psalm 19:7, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH uses his various agencies to give his testimony. He gives testimony to disclose his purposes, which testimony enlightens those who are teachable. The creature that hears his testimony and becomes obedient thereto is wise. The creature may be very simple, and yet if he inclines his ear to the testimony of Jehovah and deports himself in harmony therewith he becomes enlightened and wise. Therefore it is written in the Psalms: ‘ ‘ The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.” (4.B.F.) There is no reason to be in doubt about the testimony of Jehovah. It is unchangeable, sure, solid, steadfast </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">immovable. Those who maintain their integrity toward Jehovah trust him implicitly and learn that he is their everlasting strength. They know that they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">a sure foundation for their faith.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah employs signs or miracles to bear testimony ; hence it is written that ‘ the sign has a voice ’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">term “voice”, as used in the Word of God, means </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">proclamation or address. It is a message bearing testimony of and concerning Jehovah’s purpose. The Scriptures disclose that Jehovah at times has given his creatures the power to perform miracles or signs, which signs bear testimony of Jehovah’s purpose and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font5">which testimony the wise derive profit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> When Moses was a young man he fled from Egypt. Later he became the keeper of the flock of his fatherin-law Jethro. While herding the flock at the base of Mount Horeb lie saw a miracle performed. A flame of fire enveloped a bush, and yet the bush was not burned. It was then that the Most High revealed his name Jehovah to Moses. There Jehovah began to disclose his purpose to vindicate his holy name. He ordered Moses to return to Egypt, there to serve notice </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">Pharaoh and then to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and bring them to Mount Horeb to worship him. The Scriptures do not disclose that the Israelites </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Egypt were crying unto Jehovah, but that they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">crying against their oppressors and Jehovah heard them. He said to Moses: “Now therefore, be</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hold, </span><span class="font5">the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”—Ex. 3: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Moses feared that the people of Israel would not believe that he was sent by Jehovah God: “And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.” (Ex. 4:1) Thereupon Jehovah gave Moses the power to perform three signs or miracles, “that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, me God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.” (Ex. 4:5) The three signs or miracles were these: (1) The turning of Moses’ rod into a serpent; (2) the leprous hand; and (3) the turning of water into blood. Each one of these signs carried a message or proclamation that was ‘a voice, or testimony, from Jehovah’ making known his purpose to vindicate his name. Probably Moses did not understand that purpose; but he had great faith and obeyed Jehovah, and by so doing received Jehovah God’s approval.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> There at the base of Mount Horeb Jehovah began the production of a great moving picture, God causing a record thereof to be written, and later assured the faithful followers of Christ Jesus that the same was written for the aid and comfort of the remnant of God and to be understood by that remnant following the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah. Faithful followers of Christ Jesus have at different times tried to get an understanding of the ‘voice of the signs’ given to Moses. In September 15, 1907, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the matter was considered, and some very interesting thoughts expressed. It was not then, however, God’s due time for this matter to be understood. Man has no power to interpret prophecy. The Lord makes it clear in his own due time, and he usually reveals the same to his people by having them perform something in fulfilment of the prophecy and then discloses to his faithful the meaning thereof. This is always a strengthener to their faith. All honor and credit for such understanding and explanation is due to and is gladly given to Jehovah God. This revelation he brings to his people through his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, the Head of his organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0</sup> In sending Moses to Egypt and using him in connection with the Israelites Jehovah used certain things and creatures which symbolically represent greater things to come. Moses represented Christ Jesus at times. God caused Moses to write: ‘ ‘ The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deut. 18:15) Confirming this Jesus said: “Moses . . . wrote of me.” (John 5:46) Jesus so taught his disciples, and Peter testified accordingly that Moses was a type of Christ Jesus. (Acts 3:22) In some parts of the picture made by Jehovah Moses represented, not Christ Jesus the Head, but the followers of Christ in the covenant with Jehovah, and particularly those on earth at the second coming of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Pharaoh and his organized world power pictured or represented Satan and his cruel organization. It was in Egypt, the symbol of Satan’s world, that the Israelites, God’s chosen people, were domiciled, having been sent there by Jehovah that his purpose might be carried out. The Israelites primarily represented Jehovah’s chosen people in Christ, and secondly all of those who take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and who maintain their integrity toward him. It has been in these latter days, at the present time, that the Almighty God has revealed his name Jehovah and caused his people to understand the significance thereof. This he has done at the time of sending Christ Jesus to his temple to judge and deliver his own people and to judge and destroy Satan’s organization. The fulfilment of the prophecy which Jehovah has revealed to his people is good reason for them to expect to find that the three signs performed by Moses have been wrought by Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Moses, and that the understanding thereof may now by the grace of the Lord be had by the temple class. If so, such is a further proof that Jehovah has sent Christ Jesus to his temple for judgment and that judgment is now in progress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SIGNS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> TJie three signs Moses performed before the Israelites, and in this Aaron was associated with him. Two of those signs were performed before Pharaoh. Jehovah would first supply the evidence and convince the Israelites that he had sent Moses to them, and then he would also give proof to Pharaoh as a warning to him and his organization. Both the Israelites and Pharaoh must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God. Both the people of Jehovah and those of Satan’s organization must now be informed that Jehovah is God. The first sign was the rod of Moses which was thrown to the ground and became a serpent. As a herder of sheep Moses carried a shepherd’s rod. This was used in connection with the first sign. (Ex. 3:1) “And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand! And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.”—Ex. 4:2-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> The time had come for Jehovah to send his deliverer to Egypt to make for himself a name. He had selected Moses for this purpose to deliver his testimony to the Israelites, and Moses had raised the question as to whether or not the Israelites would hear him and believe that the Lord had appeared unto him. The fulfilment of this prophetic picture began in 1914. The time had then come for Jehovah to send forth his beloved Son, whom Moses pictured, to make for himself, Jehovah, a name. It was then that he placed Christ Jesus his King upon his holy hill in Zion. (Ps. 2: 6) It was then that he sent him forth to rule amongst the enemy. “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) That was the appropriate time for Jehovah to propound the question to the Christ: “What is that in thine hand?” Moses held a shepherd’s rod in his hand. The shepherd’s rod of Moses could be used as a weapon against beastly and human enemies. It was a rod that could be used as a scepter. (Ezek. 19:14) Concerning his second coming as Judge and King, Christ Jesus said: ‘When the Lord shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels with him, then will he sit upon his throne of glory,’ and that would be the time that he would as a shepherd divide the sheep from the goats. (Matt. 25: 31-46) He began his reign in 1914, but it was in 1918 when he came to the temple for judgment and for the separation of the sheep and goats. He is sent to shepherd the nations, and his rod appears then to be “a rod of iron”. (Ps. 2:9) Concerning the birth of the nation, or beginning of the kingdom, it is written: “And she brought forth a son, a manchild, who was about to shepherd all the nations with a sceptre of iron.” (Rev. 12: 5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> These scriptures prove that the rod or scepter is a symbol of authority and power which Jehovah has delegated to Christ Jesus and to be used to carry out Jehovah’s purpose.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup>Referring now to the picture: At the command of Jehovah Moses cast his rod on the ground. This could not mean the casting away or letting go of all power and authority by Jehovah or by Christ Jesus that wickedness might run riot. Long before Moses performed this sign Satan, who possessed the power to rule, had rebelled against Jehovah and had challenged Jehovah to put on earth men who would maintain their integrity toward God. The wicked one thereafter continued to operate in heaven as well as on earth. (Job 1: 6,7) Satan in this picture made at Egypt is represented by Pharaoh who was then opposing God’s power. Moses represented Christ Jesus; and, at the end of the time of Satan’s rule without interference, Christ is sent forth to begin his reign. It would be inconsistent for Christ Jesus then to let go his power and authority to rule and at the same time fulfill Jehovah’s commandment, to wit, “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. ’ ’ On the contrary, the casting of the rod to the ground or earth by Moses pictured the projecting or extending of the active power of Christ Jesus to things pertaining to the earth. Thus he did when the war in heaven took place and the casting of Satan and his angels down to the earth. Thereby Christ Jesus made all of his enemies his footstool, that is to say, confined them to the earth and its vicinity. No longer are there any enemies in heaven; and now there is but one center of disturbance, to wit, the earth, where Christ Jesus keeps a watchful eye upon the enemy and by his power holds the enemy in restraint until God’s due time for the enemy and his organization to be destroyed. Casting the rod to the earth or ground had nothing to do with the permission of evil or wickedness which began long before the picture was made in Egypt. The voice of the sign speaks a message relating to the coming of the Greater-than-Moses to deliver God’s creatures, and this is done centuries after wickedness has been in the world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Immediately after Moses cast his rod to the ground “it became a serpent”. It was the rod that became the serpent when it reached the ground or earth. The serpent is a symbol of evil, but not always a symbol of wickedness. The power and authority of Jehovah delegated to his beloved Son now takes on the form of evil to the things pertaining to the earth, that is to say, to Satan’s organization, which is now confined to the earth. Evil is that which is hurtful and brings distress, adversity, affliction and sorrow upon the one against whom it is used. Jehovah God exercises his power to inflict punishment or to enforce his judgment, and such results in evil or that which hurts the wrongdoer; but that evil is righteously used. Jehovah says: “I form the light [for the righteous], and create darkness [for the wicked, my enemies] ; I make peace </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Rotherham:</span><span class="font5"> prosperity] [for the remnant], and create evil [for Satan and his organization]. I the Lord do all these things.” (Isa. 45:7; see also Ps. 97:11; 82: 5-7; 107:10; Jude 13; also </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 1930, pages 131-147) All wrongdoing or wickedness results in evil to someone, but not all evil is wrong. When Jesus punishes his enemies, that is evil administered in righteousness. The Scriptures therefore support the conclusion that the casting of the rod to the ground and its becoming a serpent foreshadowed the extension of Jesus’ power and authority and activities to the earth, which becomes serpent-like or hurtful to Satan’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> This conclusion is fully supported by Revelation 9:11 s “And they [the locusts, the remnant, Jehovah’s witnesses] had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon [that is, Destroyer],, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.” Christ Jesus is that king, and as such he commands his organization and he inflicts punishment, which is evil, upon Satan’s organization. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 145.) Even “the horses” in the army of the Lord inflict evil like serpents, as it is written: ‘<sup>1</sup> For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. ’ ’ (Rev. 9:19) Concerning those who become the enemies of Jehovah he says: “For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 8:17) “And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.” (Amos 9:3) The Scriptural evidence is therefore conclusive that the ‘rod cast to the ground, and which became a serpent’, pictures power and authority from Jehovah which he had delegated to Christ Jesus and which is being used against the enemies of Jehovah now confined to the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> When the rod of Moses was suddenly turned into a serpent, “Moses fled from before it.” It is certain that Moses did not here represent Christ Jesus himself, because He does not flee. In this part of the picture Moses represented the footstep followers of Christ Jesus on the earth at the time when Christ cast the enemy out of heaven by the exercise of power and authority conferred upon him by Jehovah. Christ Jesus, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth, did not flee. Those in Christ and on earth and who are, because of their devotion to God, counted as members of the Christ, did flee, as it is written: “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” (Rev. 12:6,14; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> Book One, pages 246, 247) The rod of Moses did not at any time picture Satan the Dragon. It was the power of Jesus Christ exercised against Satan and his angels that cast him out of heaven and thus stirred the hatred of Satan against the members of Jehovah’s organization then on earth, and these fled to the wilderness where Jehovah had provided shelter and protection for them after the strife of the World War. The fleeing of Moses before the serpent corresponds to this; and the one corroborates the other and thus shows the fulfilment of the prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ About 1918 fear laid hold upon God’s people on the earth. The faithful must overcome fear in every way as it relates to Jehovah’s use of power to bring about evil or punishment upon the enemy. Jehovah then sent forth his witnesses, the remnant, to declare his message of evil or his vengeance against the enemy; and now his witnesses, the remnant, must take in their hand the prophetic message of God’s vengeance and use it against the enemy as an evil thing, as a serpent, serving notice upon the enemy organization and sound</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font5">the warning to all. In making the picture, therefore, Jehovah said to Moses, here representing the faithful remnant: “Put forth thine hand, and take it [the serpent] by the tail.” The world-wide distribution of the message of truth which declares God’s purpose to vindicate his name and to destroy the enemy and his organization is the exercise of evil against the enemy. This message has been and is being distributed by the remnant throughout the earth, and symbolically that work represents the taking of the serpent by the tail.—See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 167.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Moses put forth his hand “and caught it [the serpent], and it became a rod in his hand”. In this he pictured Christ Jesus. This part here pictured shows that Jehovah determines the time when the final battle of the day of God Almighty, the battle of Armageddon, is to be fought and when it shall end. Christ Jesus uses the rod as a serpent against the enemy organization and fully and completely metes out judgment against Jehovah’s enemies. This being accomplished there is no further need for the rod to be used as a serpent, but thereafter it is used as a means of shepherding and healing; as it is written: “I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said it.” (Ezek. 21:17) Jehovah’s power and authority delegated to and used by Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Moses, ceases to operate as a serpent at the conclusion of the battle of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">great day of God Almighty. Christ Jesus then reports to Jehovah with his rod or power, and there</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font5">the rod is used, not to smite, but to heal: ‘ ‘ And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">entreated of them, and shall heal them.” (Isa. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19: 22) </span><span class="font5">This Jehovah does in vindication of his holy name, that all may know that he is God and has sent Christ Jesus as the Deliverer. “That they may believe </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that the </span><span class="font5">Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. ’ ’—Ex. 4: 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> It is necessary for Jehovah’s anointed remnant to know these great truths, that their faith may be strong and that .they may be encouraged to press on in the battle. It was in the year 1914 that Christ Jesus began to exercise his power to cast the enemy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">the earth. It is from and after 1918 that he executes judgment, and which will terminate in the great battle of God Almighty. It is since the beginning of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">exercising of judgment that the faithful remnant have learned that Christ Jesus is at the temple, and that the name of the Almighty God is Jehovah, and have been advised as to the meaning of that name. Such has greatly strengthened God’s remnant people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is since </span><span class="font5">the year 1918 that the remnant have learned the meaning of evil and why Jehovah ‘creates evil’ like a serpent. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in May, 1930, published for the first time the Scriptural proof of this, under the title “Peace and Evil”, and this is a confirmation to the remnant that Jehovah has sent his Vindicator, the Greater-than-Moses, and who was foreshadowed by Moses. The remnant therefore see why these things written aforetime are for their comfort.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOUTHPIECE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1T</sup> Two more signs were given to Moses, and still he doubted his qualifications to appear before Pharaoh and act as Jehovah’s witness in delivering the testimony. He pleaded lack of eloquence. A similar excuse has been made by others of Jehovah’s witnesses. The young prophet Jeremiah made a similar plea before Jehovah when directed to go and testify to the house of Israel. (Jer. 1: 5-9) Many amongst the consecrated have thought that they must rely upon their own natural qualifications when sent on an important mission in the name of the Lord. The real difficulty has been, on their part, a lack of faith and a lack of unselfish devotion to Jehovah. Even to this day some of the anointed when called upon to perform a certain duty in the name of the Lord likewise plead a lack of qualification. At this point in the picture Moses foreshadowed such. Jehovah’s witnesses must learn that, not in their own strength can they accomplish God’s purpose, but that they can by the grace of God, and in his spirit, do whatsoever he commands them to do. To Moses’ plea of lack of qualification Jehovah responded: “And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth ? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind ? have not I the Lord ? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.” (Ex. 4:11,12) And still Moses hesitated. “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses; and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. ’ ’—Ex. 4:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Here Moses played a double part. When hesitating and making excuses he pictured those on earth whom Jehovah sends forth as his witnesses and who are timid and hesitate to go. When telling Aaron what to say he pictured Christ Jesus in command of his organization. Jehovah sent Aaron with Moses to be his mouthpiece or spokesman. Christ Jesus sends forth the faithful members of his body on earth to be his earthly mouthpiece to declare the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The primary purpose for making this picture enables the remnant now to definitely locate the time of the fulfilment thereof. Moses is sent into Egypt to bear the testimony of Jehovah, which is to inform the Israelites and to serve notice upon Pharaoh, and to aet as deliverer of the Israelites and, above all, to vindicate Jehovah’s name. The Greater-than-Moses, Christ Jesus, takes his power to reign in A.D. 1914, comes to the temple in 1918, and then begins the serving of notice in fulfilment of the picture. “And the Lord said to Aaron [picturing the brethren of Christ, to wit, Jehovah’s witnesses, and who are the earthly mouthpiece of Christ], Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he [Aaron] went [beginning in the latter part of 1919], and met him [Moses, in 1922] in the mount of God [the kingdom], and kissed him [thus showing the unselfish devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses to the Lord and their willingness to obey in this day (Ps. 110:3)].” Moses then told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him and concerning the signs about which he had commanded him; and then Moses and Aaron gathered together the Israelites and did the signs in the sight of the people, and the people believed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Mark now the facts fitting the prophetic picture and hence fixing the time of its fulfilment. Shortly after the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the temple of Jehovah, in 1918, the World War ended and Jehovah’s people began to be active again. It was in the autumn of 1919 that the consecrated saw that Elisha foreshadowed a work that must be done, and they started on their journey in the wilderness to learn of the Lord what was to be done and with the purpose of then doing it. Those on the earth who had devoted themselves to Jehovah, and who were foreshadowed by Aaron, met the Lord in the kingdom in 1922, at which time the purpose of the kingdom was seen for the first time, and at the time when there was a second effusion of the holy spirit. Manifestly this marks the time of their anointing; and then it was that they raised the slogan: ‘ ‘ Advertise the King and the Kingdom.” It was from that time forward that many volunteered to go into the service, and, like Aaron, these have gone forward declaring the voice of the signs, giving the testimony of Jehovah to the people who are out of sympathy with Satan’s organization, and who are to be delivered from Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s anointed people must first receive this knowledge themselves concerning the kingdom and its importance, and that the deliverance from Satan’s organization would follow the giving of Jehovah’s testimony. Gradually the Lord gave this light to his people. Prior to 1924 many of the Lord’s anointed understood that Satan was bound, and not until the autumn of that year was the proof clearly brought forth showing that Satan is not bound. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 1924, page 307.) The birth of the nation, or beginning of the kingdom, was not discerned until early in 1925, and even then many of the consecrated could not discern it. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 1925, page 67.) In the year 1926 the Lord gave to his people the message set forth in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance. {The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 1926, page 186) That was the beginning of the understanding by the anointed that Satan has builded a powerful organization, which will be destroyed in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Then Jehovah gave to his people the significance of his own great name and sent them forth to declare it. This information being first given to Jehovah’s witnesses, they must go forth and do the work which the Lord God has given them to do. Jehovah put his words in their mouth and put his protecting hand over them and commanded them, and still commands them, to declare his truth while he lays the foundation of the new organization on earth. (Isa. 51:16) When Moses and Aaron met with the Israelites and performed these three signs before the Israelites, then they were fully equipped to go on with the work of serving notice upon Pharaoh and of leading the Israelites out of Egypt.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOING TO EGYPT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> In obedience to Jehovah’s commandment Moses and Aaron went to Egypt, appeared before Pharaoh, and delivered the testimony. Upon hearing this testimony Pharaoh challenged the name of Jehovah and deliberately cast reproach upon his holy name. He was the first man on earth to do these two things, and in that he represented the Devil and his organization now on earth. The defiance of Pharaoh was a glaring and brazen insult to Jehovah. This is fulfilled by the Lord Jesus and his body members’ serving notice upon the Devil and his organization and the insults to Jehovah that follow from such enemies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron to appear before Pharaoh: “When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. ’ ’ (Ex. 7:9) The appearing of Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh shows how God’s remnant people on earth, under the command and immediate leadership of Christ Jesus, must show themselves before the rulers, both visible and invisible, representing Satan, and to testify before them and before Gog and Satan that they are on Jehovah ’s side and are his witnesses and representatives taken out from the world and sent forth to testify to the name of the Most High. They must serve notice upon that anti-Jehovah crowd and emphatically and seriously announce Jehovah’s purpose to execute his vengeance against all his enemies. Particularly since the coming of the Lord to the temple of Jehovah, Satan’s representatives on earth have emphatically denied that Jehovah’s witnesses do represent the Most High God and his kingdom, even as Pharaoh demanded that Moses and Aaron should show a miracle. The Lord has used his people to perform a miracle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The order of Jehovah given that Aaron cast the rod of Moses before Pharaoh pictures how the Lord Jesus bids his faithful body members, the remnant who are Jehovah’s witnesses, to put on the garments of vengeance and zeal as for a cloak and declare the vengeance of the Most High against Satan’s organization. (Isa. 59:17) Thus these identify themselves as in harmony with Jehovah God and in his army, having the zeal of the Lord Jesus for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. As the antitypical Jehu Christ Jesus goes forth to execute judgment against the enemies of Jehovah, the body members, the remnant, must have a part in this judgment in this, to wit, that they declare the vengeance of Jehovah God and sing forth Jehovah’s praises. As the witnesses of Jehovah they make known to the rulers and to the people that at Armageddon the rod or power of Christ, turned into that which is like a serpent, and used to inflict evil or just punishment upon Satan’s organization, will demonstrate to all that Jehovah is the Almighty God over the whole earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup>Moses and Aaron obeyed Jehovah’s commandment to appear before the enemy. “And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron east down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.” (Ex. 7:10) This going in and declaring the testimony of Jehovah before the antitypical Pharaoh crowd is being done by Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful remnant, now on earth. This work seemed to have reached a high peak in 1931 when the message, “The Kingdom, The Hope of the World,” was heralded throughout the land and the booklet containing that message was delivered to the ruling class throughout “Christendom” as well as to the people therein. Jehovah’s witnesses, whom Aaron foreshadowed, continue to declare with all their delegated authority (pictured by the rod) that Jehovah will bring upon Satan’s organization “the worst of the heathen”, meaning the nation of Jehovah, which is the worst that has ever gone against Satan’s organization. (Ezek. 7:24; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 7G) Jehovah’s witnesses, under the leadership of Christ Jesus, go forth amidst ‘wild beasts’ and do their work fearlessly, the ‘wild beasts’ being the visible part of Satan’s organization. In doing this work they act as “wise as serpents and harmless as doves”. They do no executing work themselves, but their work is that of declaring God’s purpose to destroy Satan’s organization by his great right arm, Christ Jesus. They continue to serve notice upon the Devil’s wicked organization. Then another great high peak in the work is reached in the message “Can the American Government Endure?” and which is a further notice to Satan and his representatives that every vestige of that wicked organization shall be destroyed by the Most High. Now the earthly ruling organization of Satan, under the immediate direction of Gog, their invisible leader, denounces Jehovah’s witnesses as evildoers, like unto serpents, and they counsel and conspire together to destroy them. (Ps. 83:4) Hence the miracle performed before Pharaoh by the easting of the rod to the ground, and its becoming a serpent, pictures the serpent-like stinging work against Satan’s organization that is now carried on in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TRY TO COUNTERACT THE MESSAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Satan’s chief representative on earth then summoned his counselors of war. “Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. ” (Ex. 7:11) As Pharaoh then called together his counselors, so now all of the officials of the Devil’s organization enter into a counsel and conspire against the Lord and against his anointed. When the magicians of Pharaoh cast their rods before Pharaoh they became serpents. That foreshadowed the activity of Satan exerting his power of wickedness, which brings suffering and oppression upon the people after he was cast to the earth. Hence the Lord caused to be written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea 1 for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev.J2:12) The “inhabiters” here picture the ruling class, which resorts to oppressive deeds of wickedness, and which brings great woe and suffering upon the people. The “sea” represents the people that are already alienated from God and that suffer. The Devil’s earthly “wise men”, sorcerers and magicians, that is to say, fraudulent sleight-of-hand performers, the political, financial and religious elements of Satan’s organization on earth, exercise their Devil-given powers in their desperate endeavor to offset or counteract the work of Jehovah, the purpose on their part being to turn the people away from Almighty God and to hold them in subjection. They try to show to the people that they have power equal to that of Jehovah God and can accomplish what he does. These Devil representatives claim for themselves the title “the higher powers” and demand that the people give heed to what they have to say. The powers that they have received from Satan they use fraudulently and wickedly to defame the name of Jehovah and to bring great affliction, sorrow and suffering upon the people, and this brings such suffering that the world is now in the throes of the worst depression and trouble it has ever heretofore known. Still there is more, and a worst time of trouble, to follow. The ‘rod-like serpent’ of these tricksters is against the truth and hence anti-God and anti-kingdom, because they support and serve Satan’s wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Aaron’s rod, serpent-like and declaring evil against the enemy, is used for the good of the people and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. “For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.” (Ex. 7:12) Antitypically, the two “rods” are now proclaiming against each other; and when Jehovah takes an active part in the execution of his judgment at Armageddon, his power or rod of evil wielded by his “right hand”, Christ Jesus, the great executor, will completely swallow up all evil and wickedness that Satan and his serpent agents are putting upon the people. In this way Jehovah will demonstrate that his power is supreme and that before it all of Satan's combined power must fall. Jehovah will cut that wicked work short in his righteous way. (Rom. 9:28) Satan will first see all of his organization destroyed before he is cast into the abyss, and thereby Jehovah will show him that he is the Almighty God over all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Satan will never change from his wicked ways. “And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.” (Ex. 7:13) Pharaoh here well foreshadows this. The message of the vengeance of God now being declared before Satan and his representatives will never result in their submission to Jehovah. During the millennial reign of Christ these wicked ones will be dead. When at the end of that time they are brought out of the abyss, both Satan and those who follow him will defy Jehovah God and will suffer destruction for ever. —Rev. 20:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah is now causing his testimony to be given before the rulers of the world, both visible and invisible, that they may never have an excuse to say that advantage was taken of them. He is also causing this information to be given to the people who have a desire for righteousness, that they may declare themselves and take their stand on the side of the Most High and live. For the aid and comfort and encouragement of his witnesses, his faithful remnant, Jehovah long ago made these pictures and now reveals the meaning thereof. Happy are they who now see and appreciate what the great God has done and is doing for them; and they will show forth their appreciation thereof by continuing to declare the works and the name of the Most High.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>UNDERSTANDING GOD’S WORD AND PURPOSE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5">MONG the holy men of old who wrote prophecy was Daniel, a man much beloved of Jehovah God. God moved Daniel’s mind and hand to write of the marvelous things that should come to pass. Daniel did not understand what he wrote, and so stated. God gave him some evidence by which those living at the time of the fulfilment of his prophecy might understand. He locates the fulfilment as being the time of the second coming of the Lord, “the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people.” Then to Daniel he said: “But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.”—Dan. 12:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The peoples of earth are now seeing the fulfilment of this prophecy. The prophet's words, namely, “run to and fro, ’ ’ indicate an earnest and careful study or perusal of the Word of God at “the time of the end” by those who are devoted to the Lord God, because the time has come for the opening of the words of the prophet to God’s servant class. Since the Word of God was written for his covenant people (Rom. 15:4), and not for unbelievers, and since the prophet says that at “the time of the end’’ many shall “run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased’’, we should expect that the increase of knowledge mentioned would be had by those who are God’s anointed people, rather than that it would be an increase of knowledge by worldly persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Daniel had written down the history of the world powers, and what should happen long after his day, he said: “And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, 0 my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?’’ (Daniel 12: 8) In answer to his request Jehovah replied: “ Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” {Dan. 12:9,10) Without doubt the time has come when the Bible is to be understood; and those who trust in God and in his Word, and in the great sacrifice of his beloved Son, shall be purified, made clean and white, that their faithfulness to God might be established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “wicked” are those who have once had some knowledge of God and who have used this knowledge for their own selfish ends. They shall not understand. This explains why the modern clergymen do not understand. The “wise”, within the meaning of Daniel’s prophecy, are those who have had some knowledge of God and his Word and who apply that knowledge according to God’s holy will. These are they who humbly and joyfully obey the truth as they see it. These great and deep truths, long kept a secret from man, are now due to be understood; and to those who honestly seek to understand the Lord says: ‘ ‘ The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.”—Ps. 25:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font5">state it briefly then: God created man as the highest element of earth’s creation. He created the earth for man’s home. He willed that man should have a record of the vital parts of his own experiences; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">so arranged that the knowledge of man’s relation to God should be transmitted from one generation to another, from Adam to the Prophet Moses. With Moses he began to make written record of the Holy Scriptures. God guided Moses, and the other faithful men who wrote thereafter, in preparing the texts of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Bible. He has preserved the Bible against every attempt of Satan and his agencies to destroy it. God </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">permitted many copies of the Scriptures to be made, and these to be made by honest, sincere men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">may therefore confidently rely upon the Word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">God as absolutely true. David, one of the prophets, wrote: “For the word of the Lord is right; and all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">works are done in truth. ’ ’—Ps. 33: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The devout student may come with confidence to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Scriptures, knowing that these set forth the will of God concerning man and are given to man for his instruction in righteousness. Upon the Scriptures he can confidently rely. The Scriptures constitute the basis of his faith in God, and a knowledge thereof enables him to understand something of the great love of God toward the human family. As God sheds further light upon his Word, and this shines into the minds of devout men who have consecrated themselves to do God’s will, the true heart sentiments of such find expression in the words of the psalmist:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, 0 Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth. ’ ’—Ps. 138: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The honest and earnest searcher after truth is not left to conjecture. He does not have to rest his conclusions upon the opinions of men; and, having the Bible and knowing that it is the Word of God, that it is right and absolutely true, by it he can prove every doctrine that is offered. ‘<sup>1</sup> To the law and to the testimony,” says the Prophet Isaiah (8:20), “if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” As progress is made in the study of the divine purpose let each point be proved by the Scriptures. If that which is advanced is not in harmony with the Scriptures it should be rejected. If supported by the Scriptures it should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How gracious our Lord is to man, his creature! Even though man is imperfect and sinful, God says to him: ‘ ‘ Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” (Isa. 1:18) Using his reasoning faculties with which the Lord has endowed him, and harmonizing scripture with scripture, man is enabled to build a foundation and structure of faith that cannot be shaken by the sophistries of men nor by the influence of the wicked one. As man’s knowledge of God and his purpose grows, his love for and devotion to God, the great 'Giver of every good and perfect gift’, expands. Thus continuing to walk in the light, his pathway will grow brighter and brighter until it leads unto the perfect day.—Prov. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God does not employ coercion to induce men to obey him. God is love, and his purpose is to teach his creatures that love is the only proper motive for action. Love is unselfishness expressed. The way to everlasting life God has pointed out. There is no other way. He who loves God will obey him. The man who is prompted by love to walk and who obediently goes in the way that God has pointed out, will ultimately receive the prize of everlasting life. This is the lesson that God would have man learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan, by fraud, deceit and coercion, induces men to obey him. Thereby Satan turns the minds of men away from God and leads them into the way of death. Man must have an opportunity to choose the way of righteousness or the way of unrighteousness. Such opportunity was given to Adam, and he chose the wicked way. To this time most men have gone in the same sinful course. Only those who have trusted in the Lord and faithfully endeavored to serve him have escaped the fruits of unrighteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It grieved Jehovah that the mass of mankind had turned to wickedness. By the great flood in the time of Noah God would teach his intelligent creatures that his power is unlimited, and that the workers of iniquity must ultimately suffer complete defeat. Hence he destroyed the wicked ones in the flood. The great flood was not an expression of vindictive malice on the part of Jehovah, because God does not possess malice and therefore could not express it. Malice is that condition of heart which induces one to act recklessly and in utter disregard of the rights or welfare of others, and is willfully bent on doing irreparable injury. The flood was for the vindication of God’s holy name and for the ultimate good of his intelligent creation, particularly man. This will be clearly seen when the divine purpose is understood by men. The great flood was a necessity, and it was an act of Jehovah’s prompted by love on the part of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can it be said then that the creation of man was a failure? So far as man is concerned, Yes; so far as God is concerned, No. Had man been obedient to God, in due time the earth would have been filled with a race of perfect creatures. Being drawn away by the influence of the wicked one, and yielding thereto, man became a failure. Those few men who have done their best to obey and serve God because of love for him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">not and are not failures. God’s provision to meet the emergency shows that from his viewpoint the creation of man was not a failure. In his own due time </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">will demonstrate the wisdom of the course faithful men have taken. His purpose understood will demonstrate to all men that everything Jehovah has done is just and right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s purpose concerning man was in no respect a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">failure. </span><span class="font5">He made his arrangement, knowing that he is equal to any emergency that arises. Although he saw that it was wise to destroy the old world by the flood because of the wickedness of the creatures thereof, the power of God is not limited; and in his own due time he will bring good out of that disaster. The Scriptures say: “Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) But these words do not indicate that Jehovah had or has a plan, because a plan would indicate a limitation to God’s power and wisdom. There is no need for him to make a plan, because there is no limitation to God’s power. His wisdom is perfect. The almighty God determines to do certain things and his infinite wisdom knows these things and knows when they will begin and when they will end. He is wholly and completely self-contained. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> 1930, page 101.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is manifest that God would have found more pleasure in the full obedience of man to his law; but the fact that his creatures have disobeyed his law in no wise argues against the wisdom of his creation or of his purpose relating to creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the flood God commanded righteous Noah and his sons to multiply and replenish the earth. (Gen. 9:1) They proceeded to do so. But was Noah righteous? He was an imperfect man, because he was an offspring of Adam; but his heart was right and he had faith in God and manifested that faith, and because of his faith he was counted righteous. Being the descendants of Adam, it was impossible for Noah and his sons to produce a perfect race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the human race is ever to enjoy life everlasting, some power greater than human must be employed. A man cannot by his own boot-straps lift himself over a great mountain top. Neither can man by his own efforts make himself perfect. The evolutionists display the same amount of “wisdom” that the man does who tries to lift himself over the mountain by his own boot-straps. Many men belong to this foolish class who think they can perfect themselves. Men have to be taught the truth, and God has made ample provision for this.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>KINGDOM QUALIFICATIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HEN men ehoose one of their number to rule over them they consider carefully the various qualifications of that one. Even the best choice, however, proves in time to be lacking in many of the qualities required and desirable in a true governor. In Jehovah’s everlasting government of peace, the King of kings will be the desire of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who will be associated with the King, Christ Jesus, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font5">righteous government or kingdom of God? What </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">the qualifications for official position in that gov</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ernment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meekness is one of the qualifications of those who make progress toward the kingdom. When Jesus came and offered himself to Israel as king he came in meekness. (Matt. 21:5) To his disciples he said: “Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.” (Matt. 11: 29) He was not puffed up nor impressed with his great importance. He appreciated the fact that he was God’s representative. Why is meekness a necessary requirement or qualification? God through his prophet answers: “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” (Ps. 25:9) Pride is the very opposite of meekness. One who has been favored of the Lord and then becomes proud and haughty is wicked in the sight of the Lord. Concerning such God says: “The Lord lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. ’ ’—Ps. 147: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be meek means that one does not think more highly of himself than he ought to think. (Rom. 12: 3) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">always keeps in mind that whatsoever he has is pot by reason of his own greatness but everything worth while is a gracious gift to him from God. Jehovah is the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The poor in spirit are those who do not feel exalted in their own minds but who walk in meekness and in love before the Lord. Jesus said: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ’ ’ (Matt. 5:3) One of the qualifications, therefore, is to be meek. Again he said: “Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’’ (Matt. 19:4) A little child is meek and teachable, and if being properly trained it is obedient. These are the qualifications that must be manifested by those who will be of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These divinely stated rules would exclude those who are proud, haughty, and self-centered, and who seek the honor and plaudits of men. The clergy of modern times claim to be righteous, and at the same time they seek the honor of men. They unite with profiteers and politicians to form and participate in the present evil world, over which Satan is the god. They are the exact counterparts of the Pharisees, who constituted the clergy when Jesus was on earth and who claimed to be the representatives of God. To the disciples Jesus said: “For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom Of heaven. ’ ’—Matt. 5: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “holy hill” of God is a poetical name given to the official part of God’s organization, called Zion, or the kingdom of God. The tabernacle for God’s holy ark was a picture of the kingdom. David, who foreshadowed Christ, propounded a question: “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?” (Ps. 15:1) Under inspiration he gave the answer which shows the qualifications required to enter the kingdom: “He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart [meaning he whose course of action is right, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">who speaks the truth, and refrains from lies; and whose motive in so doing is to glorify God]. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neigh</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">bour </span><span class="font5">[meaning he that does not indulge in slander of his brother or try to do injury to one who represents </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord]. </span><span class="font5">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned [avoided]; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not [making a consecration, and knowing it means his reproach, suffering and death, he carries it out]. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent [that does not indulge in oppression, but deals honorably and justly]. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.”—Ps. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again God through his prophet asks: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?” (Ps. 24:3) Again the prophet answers the question: “He that hath clean hands [meaning that he uses his power for clean things and refrains from things that are contrary to God’s kingdom], and a pure heart [the heart, the seat of motive; meaning that his motive is pure and right and in harmony with God’s law]; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity [the worship of idols, church systems and the like], nor sworn deceitfully [agreed to do God’s will and then takes a contrary course]. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. ’ ’—Ps. 24: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus had repeatedly told his disciples about the kingdom. He taught them in parables concerning the kingdom. Among other things he said: ‘ ‘ The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. ’ ’ (Matt. 13:45,46) The privilege of being in and a part of God’s kingdom is greater than any other that man could possibly have, because it means to be for ever associated with the Lord Jesus in his great work. It is more than the pearl of priceless value. If the merchant would sell all he had to buy such a pearl, with stronger reasoning should the man be willing to give everything he possesses that he might have a part in the kingdom of the Lord. Having taken the step then toward the kingdom, his zeal for the Lord is such, and his joy in having a part in the blessed kingdom is so enhanced in his mind, that the man permits nothing to stand in the way of his absolute and complete devotion to the Lord. Such was the meaning of the parable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another requirement is to love those who are striving to serve God and who are therefore brethren in Christ. To his disciples Jesus said:“ Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you. . . . This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.” (John 15:14,12) To love one another means to look out for the interests of one’s fellow Christian and to avoid selfishness in so doing. There is a proper love between the members of each well-regulated family. Those who have become members of the family of God by consecration and anointing should manifest an unselfish interest in each other, to help each other grow in a knowledge and in the likeness of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There arose a dispute among the disciples of Jesus as to who would be the greatest in the Lord’s government. Jesus seized upon this occasion to instruct them as to the qualifications of one who would be honored with a place in his kingdom. He stated to them that the rulers of the nations of the earth exercised lordship over the people, and, thus lording it over the people, received homage of the people while claiming to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be the </span><span class="font5">people’s benefactors. Then he added: “For who is greater, he who reclines, or he who serves? Is not he who reclines? but I am among you as he who serves.”—Luke 22: 27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah disclosed to David the same rule. The spirit of the Lord came upon David and he prophesied concerning the qualifications of those who rule in righteousness. He said: ‘ ‘ The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.” —2 Sam. 23:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very few men on earth have ruled among their fellow creatures in harmony with God’s stated law. The men of this world, given authority, think they must be bosses or tyrants in ruling over their fellow creatures. But the law of God shows that the requirements of those who shall be with Christ Jesus are that they must deal justly and righteously toward mankind. Jesus was teaching his disciples this righteous rule. He knew that their heart condition was proper but they had not yet learned their lessons. The lesson he taught them is for the benefit of all who have been called to a place in the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus informed his disciples that they should be taken into his covenant for the kingdom, “even the sure mercies of David.” But mark the reason why these would be accepted in his covenant. It was not because they were mighty and wise and great. It was because of their loyalty and faithfulness. The eleven had been faithful to him in all his trials. Jesus showed by his words that faithfulness is absolutely an essential qualification to be shown by all who will be taken into the covenant and the kingdom. He said: “And you are they who have continued with me in my trials. And I covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ’ ’—Luke 22: 28-30, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of his disciples had become unfaithful. The same thing was true with reference to Israel. All of the ten tribes of Israel were unfaithful to their covenant with God. The tribe of Judah, through which tribe the kingship must come, had proven faithful. God through his prophet said: “Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.”—Hos. 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise great numbers have professed to be followers of Jesus and to represent God, but they have compassed the Lord about with lies by slandering and misrepresenting God and Jesus and persecuting the brethren of Jesus. Jesus spoke a parable in regard </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">those to whom God has given an opportunity to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the kingdom, and in connection therewith said: “For many are called, but few are chosen.” (Matt. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22:14) </span><span class="font5">The manifest reason is that many of those called become unfaithful. If a man mixes with the Devil’s organization he cannot remain faithful to the Lord. If one will compromise with the Devil’s organization to avoid persecution because he is a Christian, he is not faithful to the Lord. If one fails to be a true witness as opportunity affords he cannot be faithful to the Lord. Surely those who deny God’s Word deny the blood of Jesus Christ, which is the great ransom price, and could not be of the kingdom.—Jude 4-9; Hcb. 10:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not the prerogative of anyone to judge another individual, but the Lord gives a rule by which a Christian may be identified. <sup>11</sup> By their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matt. 7: 30) Fruit is the effect of a consistent course of action taken by one. By such course of action a person my be identified as being for or against. In America there are two major political parties. Members of these respective parties can be identified by their fruits. By that is meant, If a man belongs to one or the other, and shows by his words and his course of action that he is giving allegiance to one particular party, he is identified as a member thereof and a supporter. If he pursues a wabbly course for the purpose of obtaining favors from both opposing parties no one who knows him has confidence in him. The same rule applies to a Christian. If a man professes to be a Christian, yet is self-seeking and desires the approval of men, mixes with the politics of the world, manifests an apologetic air when the Lord’s name is mentioned, and shows no enthusiasm for the Lord and his righteous government, that man can be identified by his fruits, and his fruits are not such as are required for the kingdom. On the other hand, if you see another man who without hesitation says, “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses,” and is indifferent to the approval of men, manifests a zeal and enthusiasm for God and his righteous government, refuses to compromise with any part of the Devil’s organization and holds himself aloof therefrom, seeks always to glorify God and his beloved Son Christ Jesus, and is enthusiastic in availing himself of opportunities to be a witness for God’s kingdom, that person is manifesting the fruits of the kingdom. Anyone can see that the clergy of the present day do not manifest the fruits of the kingdom, but the fruits of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Pharisees, who were counterparts of the clergy of this day, Jesus said: “The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21:43) Those who today show a zeal for the Lord and for his kingdom will generally be found to be the poor and those without reputation among men. “Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?” (Jas. 2:5) Those bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom are anxious to devote their all to the glory of the Lord, and to magnify his name and his cause of righteousness; and this they do meekly without seeking honor or approval of men or notoriety among them.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FROM THE FIELD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A GRACIOUS GIFT OF GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am late in writing to tell you of the pleasure I had when my copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> came and to express in this way some-tiring of my gratitude to God especially for the explanation and exposition of the book of Ruth. I know that you do not look for thanks, but I am sure the Lord would have us remember those he uses as his instrument, and to give him thanks for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My copy came just about the time that you were leaving New York; and I thought I would wait awhile, and my memory played me a trick. I enjoyed the reading very much and since have more fully entered into it through the studies. The book of Ruth, like Ruth herself, has always been attractive, because of its story and its fine examples of men and women devoted to Jehovah. The three main persons, Naomi, Ruth and Boaz, are ever a means of encouragement to the servants of God, and the records concerning them are always a source of inspiration. But there was always a sense of deeper things, and when the book of Esther had yielded its secret treasures one wondered about this particular part of the Word of God with its evident association with harvesting. Now the Lord has opened it for us and given this grand confirmation of the Truth. It is clear now that the book had its own special place and that the narratives so interesting as to attract notice were particular instruction for his people of these last days. We can see now how closely the spirit of God delineated the acts of those servants of old that they might give particular lessons and instructions for us in these last days. The explanation of this book is a gracious gift of God to his remnant m this day when he is their teacher, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font4"> with its two distinct phases of God’s preserving acts, is surely a permanent blessing to us. What proofs we get of the fact that God laid up treasures for these days! I pray the Lord bless you continually, and confidently ’ expect more treasures out of the storehouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much love, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother and servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hemery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SURELY JEHOVAH IS GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s richest blessings be with you always.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Received the copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Boole</span><span class="font4"> 1933 some weeks ago. Please accept my sincerest thanks for them. I am very grateful for the favors you have very kindly bestowed, including the extra copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4"> and miscellaneous letters of advice and encouragement, and the kind treatment and hospitality shown during a visit to the factory and Bethel last week. Surely Jehovah is good to His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The favor we have to appreciate the choice truths which appear in the recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation </span><span class="font4">book is truly unspeakable. It would certainly seem to be too good to be true had we not the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fact</span><span class="font4"> of the understanding. To know Jehovah now is the greatest privilege that ever was given any creature. How glad am I that I can be one of His traveling minstrels proclaiming His glories!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in kingdom joy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Frederick Casciato, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PUT TRUST IN JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing how very busy you must be, I almost hesitate to write you. But I do wish to thank you for the two </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font4">books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font4"> and now the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford, how good Jehovah is to his people! To let us have so much rich food at his bountiful table he has wonderfully blessed you, and through you his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I must say, after almost twenty years of service, the last year has been most wonderful of all. I entered the pioneer work in June, 1932. All I can say is, What a blessed privilege to be so used! When I entered the work I did not have money enough to make change. But I put my trust in Jehovah. So far I have kept going only by his grace. Pray I may continue to be so used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I wish to relate a little experience while witnessing. It was at Easton, Pa., on one of our “city” campaigns: An old man came to the door. I said: “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, calling to bring you a message from Jehovah.” That is every word I said. He said: “I have Judge Rutherford on the radio now. I also have his books. I cannot talk to you now.” He shut the door. What impressed me was how quickly he connected the name of Jehovah with one who is seeking to honor Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May you continue; and may I continue to follow you as you follow Christ in this one great work, the vindication of Jehovah’s great name, until his name is proclaimed throughout all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ella</span><span class="font4"> M. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barber, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEASTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many times it has been our hearts ’ wish to write you, giving expression of our love and appreciation of your loyalty, devotion and leadership of this the greatest of all work, until now it seems that our blessings are multiplied a hundredfold. When we note the way Jehovah is directing us it is with awe and wonderment that we hurry along ‘bearing the fruits of the kingdom ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the closing of the year, in looking back over the past eleven months we have so much to be thankful for: the first two great feasts, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> together with the wonderful messages brought to us through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">Last and best of all are the two divinely directed dramas of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can now see our position or place in the Lord’s blessed arrangement for his anointed, being guided and protected while carrying his message to the people. Truly we have every evidence that we are being fed with ‘ ‘ food convenient ’ ’ and have the Lord’s blessing and guidance upon the work of his witnesses; and he ‘prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies’. Praise our King!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And with thanksgiving and prayers in your behalf and all those associated with you in this the kingdom work, we would like you to know that we are not unmindful of your labor of love and manifold favors and instructions as to how to make ourselves clearly known by the name which he has named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s grace, your brethren, in the joy of the King’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P. L. and H. T. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lopp, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN NEW WORLD OF CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since I have learned of your radio broadcasts, in rendering those immaculate gospels of Jehovah, I must say that I have found myself in a new world of spiritual consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is of priceless pleasure, indeed, to hear your brilliant essays relating to the kingdom of Jehovah, and so truthfully modernized. I am certain that if mankind would grasp its axioms humanity would purge itself of those degenerate habits which make life unbearable for decent human creatures. Your work is a rare divine service, and may it live and prosper and save the world of its pitfalls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cordially yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Israel</span><span class="font4"> L </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pearlstein, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New York.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Permit us to thank you for the new books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font4"> We have been going over them carefully and rejoicing at every page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our hearts are filled with gratitude to the dear Lord, and to you, his servant, for this marvelous truth which gladdens every hour of our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We want you to know of our love for you; and in the impending trouble, the battle of the great day of JEHOVAH, we shall be with you in spirit, and by your side in every work suggested in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God bless you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEY ARE HELPLESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have never had the privilege of meeting you; but I want to tell you that we (myself and only son) eagerly listen for your voice every Sunday. Canada may try to cut it off from the people, but they are helpless in the purposes of our allpowerful and wise Jehovah God. Every Sunday morning we hear you from Bay City WBCM. Your voice comes to us as clear and distinct as if you were in the room. We get Cleveland WHK in the evening; also good. And we get Davenport WOC; all very good. Davenport is 6: 30 Canadian time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have not troubled for a long time to try for the Canadian stations, as we could not get them so well as the U.S.A, stations. We live close to Lake Huron, and it may be the water gives us the best reception from the U.S.A. I wish the people here could know they can get it just the same by tuning in on U.S.A, stations. It is such a blessing to us; and such a joy none but the isolated, as we are, can realize. Ours is only a battery set. We have no electricity in our home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have every one of your books, also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> regular visits. I am sixty-four years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May Jehovah’s richest blessings be with you as you so faithfully and fearlessly give His beautiful truth to His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I remain your sister by God’s grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Africa—A Continent in the Making</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>In Four Parts —</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part 1</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font8">ORE than one-fifth of the land surface of the world, but only one-twelfth of its population, lies in the head-shaped continent south and west of the Mediterranean and Red seas and the Indian ocean. From Cape Blanco in Tunisia to Cape Agulhas in Cape Colony is nearly five thousand miles, almost straight south. From Cape Verde in Senegal, at the back of the head, to Cape Guardafui in Italian Somaliland, at the turned-up tip of the nose, is about 4,600 miles almost straight east. The eye of this imaginary head would be about Khartoum, the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan; the mouth at Zanzibar; the border of the Red sea would be its forehead; the ear would be in the Cameroon mountains, at the great bend, near the mouth of the Niger river, on the west coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this article we hope to get better acquainted with this vast continent, associated with the earliest history of the race, and yet until recently one of the least known portions of the earth. The continent of Africa is 11,262,000 square miles, with islands of 239,000 more. Readers will find more enjoyment and profit in the study by having at hand a map of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a general way we hope to go around the head from the mouth at Zanzibar east through Tanganyika and Kenya to Somaliland; north through Abyssinia, Eritrea and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Egypt, just recently discussed in these columns; west through Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Rio de Oro to Senegal; then will come the west coast countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Gold Coast, Nigeria, French Equatorial Africa, and the Belgian Congo; and finally all the rest of Africa commonly called South Africa, and constituting the key to the whole continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On South Africa, as we shall consider it, we hope to have something to say about the Portuguese states of Angola, on the west, and Mozambique, on the east, and all the British states that lie between and to the south, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Bechuana Land, Southwest Africa, and the Union of South Africa, made up of Cape Colony, Orange Free State, Natal and the Transvaal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems hard to believe it, but the island of Madagascar, off the east coast, is larger than New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois put together. The United States is a big country, but the continent of Africa is nearly four times as large. The area of the Sahara desert alone is two-thirds that of the United States, or about the same as the whole of Europe outside of Russia.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Why It Has Remained a Dark Continent</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Peculiai' conditions have conspired to make Africa a country difficult of penetration. Its northern edge is one of the oldest inhabited countries of the world, but between that and all the rest of the country is the impenetrable Sahara. The ascent of the Nile was hindered by cataracts and by the sudd that chokes the stream just north of the equator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The coast line is almost unbroken around the entire continent, so that there are few natural harbors. The coast regions are fever-smitten. In the interior are wild animals and, till recently, and even yet in some places, cannibals. Cut off from the rest of the world by mountains, seas and deserts, and burdened by the weight of his dark color, the black man has been left to himself, except as the whites saw fit to raid his country and take him into slavery. These raids were made by sea, mostly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Escarpment mountains run nearly around the whole of Africa. These, like mighty battlements, shut off the interior and make the rivers largely useless for the purposes of navigation. Diverse languages have been a barrier. Native indolence, demonized medicine men, absence of roads, impenetrable jungles, all these have held the conti-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">nent back from contact with the whites, and from progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The advent of the white man Jias brought the black man many sorrows, but it has brought him some good things too. French and British administrators have put an end to the intertribal wars that at various times have decimated parts of the Dark Continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mohammedanism has been a curse to the blacks and has spread far into the interior; and it spreads far more rapidly than the perversion of truth which has come in the name of Christianity. The medicine man is still supreme in Africa. His intelligence may be measured from the fact that one of them ground up a phonograph record and gave it to a man who could not talk. The man got well! We have heard of persons who were vaccinated and did not get smallpox thereafter!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Natural Ability of the Blacks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">On subjects with which they are familiar, it is generally admitted that there are no better reasoners than the black men. When following the trail of game they read accurately every break in the branches, every mark in the earth, every twist in the grass, every rustling of the leaves. They can even tell the kind of prey they are tracking, its height, and sometimes its sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By means of relays of wooden gongs the blacks in central Africa quickly send complicated information hundreds of miles. How it is done the white man cannot even understand; yet it is done. From time immemorial in certain districts the natives have been accustomed to working iron, making their own knives, bush hooks, hoes, and tomahawks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every new white man is at once given a name which describes him perfectly, accentuating his peculiarities. The white man’s machines are named appropriately, to describe the sounds they emit or the work they do. The African is nothing if not original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The natives of Africa are, generally speaking, the most peaceful, most trustful, and best tempered people to be found anywhere. This would be apparent from the fact that there never has been an invasion of other lands by an uprising of blacks; nor has the black race in America ever given any serious trouble. It has had trouble, plenty of it, but the fault has generally not been of its making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As elsewhere, the blacks do the hardest kind of work efficiently and uncomplainingly. In caravans a group of four Negroes carry their own baggage, one traveler’s baggage and the traveler himself, and make fourteen to eighteen miles a day. Porters on the mail routes carry fifty pounds of mail and travel twenty-five miles per day, sometimes for as long as twenty-four days in one direction. They are so faithful that in a journey of 600 miles they are seldom more than an hour behind schedule time, and generally less than half that. They make better time in the rainy season, when they can travel without the sandals which are needed in hot weather.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Happy and Childlike Dispositions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Those who have been much in contact with the blacks in their homeland describe them as having happy and childlike dispositions, as, indeed, is the case here in America. However, here they are only one in ten of the population, while in Africa the blacks outnumber the whites fifty to one. They do not brood over their grievances; they are not oppressed with discontent. They are admittedly much easier to govern than the Hindus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If his master has beams or planks around the place the native will chop them up for firewood because they chop more easily than logs; the fact that they are valuable and expensive does not enter his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The black man will submit to photographing his home and everything he has. Today a white man is safe almost anywhere in Africa, and will be treated with courtesy and kindness and be supplied with food. Even when hundreds of miles from a white face, he can count on a friendly smile and a salute when he meets a native or a group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As in America (and in America it is not limited to the blacks), the Africans are inordinately vain, so much so that the world’s recognized market for second-hand uniforms, dress suits, etc. is in that region. A pair of trousers makes all the difference in the world in the estimate a man holds of himself in Africa, and in the estimate that others have of him. Put a pair of trousers on one who has never before worn them, and he at once becomes insufferably arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are tribes in Africa where the women paint as badly as they do in New York city. This may seem incredible to one who has ridden in a New York subway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The African natives, in some places, devote much attention to their hair and teeth, as others do elsewhere. Styles vary. Some of these natives stain their teeth blue, yellow, and purple, leaving a white tooth here and there. Others file their teeth in patterns. The style of coloring or filing shows at a glance to what tribe one belongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In some tribes the hair is plaited and wrapped with grass and clay so as to make the strands stick out “like quills upon a fretful porcupine”. Rings and bones inserted in the lips, nose, ears and cheeks make a belle look as badly as some New York women look when they have put on overmuch paint; i. e., when they have painted not wisely but too well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Missions have not worked out for the African’s betterment. Taught by the mission schools some of the elements of the white man’s trades, the native breaks away from the school and obtains work in a railroad gang or in a mine, only to learn in a short time all that is worst in life. His habits become corrupted, his reliability and trustfulness disappear, and it is literally true that he becomes twofold more the child of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font8"> than he was in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He gets other things than liquor from the white man that ruin his body and mind, and in many ways, where he is brought in close contact with the white, his childlike wonderment gradually changes into contempt as he sees the inconsistencies and selfishness that mark his white cousin’s course.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Animal Life</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">As might be expected in a country which has such a large area of rich soil, Africa has an excess of wild animals. Formerly there were many elephants, but their numbers have been reduced on account of slaughter to obtain ivory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The story that the elephants have a 'graveyard’ to which the old ones go when they can no longer care for themselves is widely believed all over Africa and Asia, but is probably not true. The aged elephants stumble and fall and die from injuries, and in a trice the jackals, hyenas, leopards, lions, vultures, hawks and eagles pick the bones, and the natives gather the ivories and do not report their find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are still plenty of lions, too many, indeed, in some districts, where they have become man-eaters. The lions soon learn that with a few cuffs of their powerful paws they can break down the walls of a native hut and get a good meal without the trouble of looking for one elsewhere. They have even been said to board a moving train and enter a sleeping-car without obtaining reservations in advance, and, moreover, to do the very impolite thing of jumping out of a window with a passenger by the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On an East African railroad a lion recently boarded the train and chased a soldier through one car and into another, ignoring several other passengers en route. Luckily, the soldier delayed him long enough by slamming doors in his face that he was able to get his gun. The first shot finished him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Occasionally there is a plague of man-eating lions in a district. In one area two lions devoured thirty-four natives. On one of these occasions they dragged a night watchman off the veranda of a white man’s home. The so-called 'spotted foot’ lions, i. e., those that have spots on the bottom portion of the legs, are considered the most dangerous type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A lion kills only when hungry. At other times he may pass through a herd of other animals without touching one. The old lions are usually killed by jackals, when their teeth fail and they no longer have the strength to hunt. Lions, even in their prime, are often killed by crocodiles.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Dreaded Crocodile</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The crocodile is one of the most dreaded of all the wild animals. He has two teeth that grow upward through his nose, and when he gets those two teeth through anything in the way of meat it is good-bye to that meat. He commonly grabs his prey by the nose, stuns it by a blow of his tail, and drags it back to the river, where he drowns it; then he dives to the underwater entrance to his cave, and climbs upward into his dining room and enjoys himself. If the meat is partly decayed he gets a bigger kick out of it than if it is fresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are districts where packs of wild dogs run at large. When they go through a territory they clean it of every living thing. Leopards and white men kill just for the lust of killing. Of the two, the men are the worse. They cripple animals and leave them to wander off and suffer from terrible wounds; they pitfall them and allow them to struggle for hours; they trap them by the leg or the neck; they chase them with dogs; they use fire to drive them; they catch them in nets; they spear them; they arrange guns which fire when bait is pulled; they throw chunks of poisoned meat where it will be eaten; they shoot poisoned arrows; they poison drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Antelopes will not run at sight of a lion, but they do run in terror at the sight of the worst of all killers, man. Efforts arc now being made in Tanganyika district to prevent hunting by motor car, as it is rapidly robbing the entire territory of its wild life. The days of big game are numbered. The lion, the giraffe, the hippopotamus and the great snakes are being exterminated, slowly but surely. Fallen man loves to break the everlasting covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why the Continent Is Alive at Night</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All writers on Africa agree that the continent is asleep by day and alive by night. Nothing moves in the blistering heat of midday; but at midnight, if one takes a large electric searchlight and goes out of camp pairs of eyes will glow and fade in every direction. There will be jackals, servals (bush cats), spring hares, genets, mongooses, antelopes, leopards, lions, cheetahs, wild dogs and hyenas where in daylight nothing more was in sight than a wart hog or a flock of guinea fowl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The dew falls early in the evening. That makes the grass sweeter and fresher, and so the grass-eaters graze mainly at night. The lions know this, and follow and hunt them then, because it is far easier to catch and kill a moving, feeding animal than one that is lying down and on the alert. A lion kills about sixty antelopes a year. His frame is large, and it takes considerable food to keep it going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some forty years ago a disease called rinderpest swept through central Africa and decimated the herds of game, especially the buffalo. Old hairless bulls and cows are now sometimes seen, and are known as rinderpest buffalo because they are survivors of the plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Leopards, panthers, hyenas, and jackals are found in most parts of Africa. Of antelopes there are fifty varieties. Giraffes are not found elsewhere. The ostrich is a native of the Dark Continent; so also is the serpent-killer called the secretary bird, and the honey-guide, which points out the nests of bees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ants in some districts are so savage that the only things safe from destruction are such articles as are packed in metal boxes. A pair of shoes left exposed for one night is riddled by morning. Even the floors of houses are eaten away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Exploration of the Dark Continent</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pharaoh Necho, the same one that killed King Josiah at the battle of Megiddo, built a canal from the Nile to the Red sea some time between 609 and 595 B.C., and hired Phoenician navigators to circumnavigate the Dark Continent. It took them three years to get around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A mere matter of two thousand years later, Henry the Navigator, ruler of Portugal, fired by a somewhat similar ambition, sent out several expeditions. In 1486 Bartholomew Diaz doubleol the Cape of Good Hope, and eleven years later Vasco de Gama sailed up the east coast as far as Mombasa, the mouth of our imaginary head, and thence across to India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Up to the middle of the nineteenth century the whole of the interior of Africa was a blank. Penetration, when it finally came, was from the south. In 1802-1806 two Portuguese traders crossed the continent from Angola to Mozambique. Now’ one can make the same journey entirely by rail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Livingstone penetrated far up into the interior, and about the time that the first stage coach went through the American desert to the Pacific coast he crossed Africa again, from the mouth of the Congo to the mouth of the Zambezi. It is not so long ago. There are plenty of people still living who can remember when this trip was made, in the late fifties. Stanley’s explorations were still more recent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About forty years ago Britain, France and Germany decided to grab Africa, and many of us can remember when these three burglars got together and decided how they would divide the loot. Since then penetration and civilization have proceeded apace. The World War, with its transfer of German possessions to the British, placed the key of the continent in the hands of England.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>London to Cape Town in Four Days</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">In the year 1898-99 the first complete trip was made between Cape Town and Cairo. It required eighteen months. Eight years ago the regulation time for the trip was fifty-three days. For the past few months the mail planes have been making it regularly in eleven days, recently cut to nine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But now, November 14-18, 1932, Amy Johnson Mollison hopped from Lympne, England, to Cape Town in 4 days 6 hours and 56 minutes, with only five hours’ sleep en route. She flew over France and Algeria, straight across the Sahara desert, and thence down the west coast to her destination, stopping only four times en route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Africa is being opened up all at once. Planes are flying hither and thither, wireless stations are everywhere, railroads are being pushed forward, bridges are being built, and highways completed on which automobiles rush to and fro, all resulting in the rapid education of the Negro, whether he ever sees the inside of a school or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trip to Victoria Falls on the Zambezi can now be made safely from the east coast, from the west coast, or from Cape Town, all the way by rail. Here a river over a mile wide plunges three times the height of Niagara, with a roar that can be heard nineteen miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A thousand miles farther north is the new and elegant city of Elizabethville, in the Congo Free State, where there are good hotels, banks, stores, residences and a generous supply of automobiles. All this has come about since the World War, because a tremendously rich vein of copper lies on the surface of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Africa has 33,000 miles of railway, with need of many more great lines to give it anything like adequate transportation. Meantime the railways already built are feeling the competition of the automobile. Falling trees constitute one of the dangers of automobile traffic in Africa. Ant hills are another potent source of danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The total annual trade with Africa, imports and exports, is around $2,500,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Beginning at Tanganyika</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Beginning at Tanganyika we start our trip around Africa. One of the reasons the World War was fought was to get this territory away from the Germans and under the control of Britain. It is the choicest colony Germany ever had, but lay square across Britain’s path from the Cape to Cairo. It is larger than all the territory in the United States lying east of the Mississippi river, west of the Hudson river, and north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is excellently situated, with the Indian ocean to the east, Lake Nyassa on the south, Lake Victoria Nyanza on the north, and Lake Tanganyika on the west. Before they gave it up at the point of a gun, the Germans had built a railroad through from Zanzibar to Lake Tanganyika, with a branch to Victoria Nyanza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lake Tanganyika, 772 miles by rail inland from the Indian ocean, was discovered by Burton and Speke in 1858. It was on the shore of this lake that Stanley found Livingstone in 1871. The lake is over 400 miles long, and 30 miles wide, and is 4,000 feet deep, with its bottom 1,600 feet below sea level. A half dozen steamers ply its waters, which swarm with fish, crocodiles and hippopotamuses. At high water it discharges into the Congo. The rift in the earth’s surface which is in evidence at Lake Tanganyika continues northward to and including Palestine, where the Jordan valley is its northern terminus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Important nickel deposits have recently been discovered in the province. Since the World War the Germans have begun to return to the colony and there are now about 800 of them working as servants on the plantations they once owned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ten years ago it was estimated that of the total population of 4,124,438 only 2,447 were Europeans. It is the claim of the British Government that they wish to keep this a black man’s country, under white domination. The natives will be permitted to do all the hard work; the whites will make such disposition of the cream as they think best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Masai tribe, which inhabits Tanganyika, is of magnificent physique. The young men are taught to encounter lions in mortal combat, armed only with a spear. The old warriors never die natural deaths. At the approach of old age they are banished from the tribe and end their days in the haunts of man-eating beasts. Their language, Swahili, is understood all over East Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Masai are people to be reckoned with. Their poisoned arrows, dipped in a concoction made of the leaves and branches of a small tree, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Acocanthera Schimperi,</span><span class="font8"> bring instant death to any creature wounded. They cut out the flesh around the wound, as soon as possible, and throw it away. The remainder is eaten and the blood is drunk. The love of blood as an article of food is common with many African tribes. Some of them go so far as to bleed their cattle and drink the blood hot or mixed with their porridge.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Kenya — British East Africa</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">If, in this imaginary head we are studying, Tanganyika is to represent the lower lip, then Kenya represents the upper one. It has Abyssinia to the north, Italian Somaliland to the northeast, the Indian ocean to the east, and Uganda to the west, with which latter it is connected by rail. It is of the size of all the territory between North Carolina and Maine, including West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The population is well mixed. Eight years ago the total was 2,475,059, including 11,002 Europeans, 24,771 Asiatics, and 9,753 Arabs. Lake Victoria Nyanza, on its southwestern border, is second in size of the fresh water lakes of the world, Lake Superior being the only larger one. It was discovered by Speke in 1858, but he did not recognize it as the source of the Nile, and, in fact, the connection was not definitely traced until nearly fifteen years afterwards. The lake is 3,600 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mountains in the vicinity of Victoria Nyanza rise to a height of 19,300 feet. Signs of volcanic activity are still visible. Though directly beneath the equator, the high ground on which the capital, Nairobi, stands makes it a desirable place of residence for Europeans. The climate is a perpetual Indian summer. The city is well built, with stone buildings and wide paved streets wherein automobiles mingle with bicycles and jinrikishas. The bulk of the trade is in the hands of East Indians, of whom there are several thousand in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kenya has every climate, from that of the tropics to that of the glaciers. Today its jungles are pretty well conquered. The lions have been reduced to stock robbers. The problem of how to keep everything for themselves and still do something for the natives, and at the same time keep the East Indians from becoming too much dissatisfied, engages the best thought of the British rulers. Educational systems, sanitation problems and experiments in government claim their attention.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Old Settlers Want to Run Everything</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The old British settlers want to run everything ; the Home Office knows that if they do the natives will get nothing, and so a few men in London try to regulate and decide and plan about everything, with the result that there is a stronger and ever stronger insistence upon home rule. Yet the settlers are not capable of independence, for they are outnumbered by the natives, 200 to 1. The settlers never know when they will need troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A settler says that to get on with the natives the employer must be just; keep his word; be generous, but not too much so; swiftly punish any wrong; feed the help well; be always ready to listen to their little complaints; know when to crack a joke with the laborers; and never wholly lose his temper. Sounds as if that program would work in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One upright judge in British East Africa astonished the white population when he sentenced an army captain to three months’ imprisonment for flogging a dumb boy over the head, face, and body for an hour. Of course there was a provocation. The boy, with little to occupy his mind, had chased a pig to death, and was chasing another; but that was no excuse for the white man’s putting his own mind on an even lower plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A man thirty years a settler in Kenya, referring to the relative safety from wild beasts, recently wrote to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies:</span><span class="font8"> “Unarmed natives and Europeans have traveled for many years and continue to travel through the heart of the game country. Accidents occasionally do occur, but for every instance of injury to man by wild animals there must be at least a thousand fatalities from motor cars. I have yet to learn of any suggestion to abolish motoring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctors in Kenya who set out to vaccinate the inhabitants report that the natives flee into the bush rather than submit to vaccination, which shows that they have more natural common sense than have the whites in New York city.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>How the Whites Got the Land</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Maybe you wonder how the whites come into possession of land in Kenya. It is very simple. They just take it. Thousands of acres have been taken from property which for centuries has been recognized as communal property belonging to certain tribes, and no compensation whatever was made therefor. Moreover, the Negro who once used the land must now live elsewhere, but he may come and work on the land for some white man. As a result 35 percent of the natives are away from their homes and families and gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Kenya native who leaves his employer before his term of service has expired can be thrown into jail. In order to trace deserters the government requires all native men and women to be fingerprinted. A Kenya native must carry a pass when outside his reserve, and is not allowed to purchase land outside that reserve. And he may not raise exportable crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When you come to think of it, the Negro is reported as getting a pretty rotten deal. His land is taken away, he must go elsewhere to rear his family, he must leave his family for months at a stretch to obtain a means of livelihood, he is fingerprinted and jailed if he leaves his work, and he cannot even buy a home near his work or have a little independent business of his own. Nobody but a kind-hearted Negro would stand that kind of treatment. Would a Britisher stand it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the whites were grabbing lands in Kenya they grabbed a plenty. The average white farm is 7% square miles. The “owners” of these farms are among the richest people in the world, owning among them some three million head of livestock. Some of them have sixty or more laborers on their farms; floggings are common. The principle of forced labor has been introduced in Kenya. Forced labor is slavery. The white man is a bad man; he does not do to others as he would wish to have done to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some years ago a missionary came from Kenya to the Colonial Office in London, urging that the withholding of the franchise from Indians who had settled there was in the interest of the native Africans. The Africans sent a cablegram to London reading as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have no faith in Dr. Arthur, and believe that he will harm our cause and favor white settlers. Our troubles emanate from white settlers only. We are afraid to declare our mind here, and fear imprisonment, transportation, or hanging. We request to be afforded an opportunity for representative natives to wait upon the Colonial Office before a decision is taken regarding the fate of our country.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Uganda, at the Head of the Nile</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Uganda, at the head of the Nile, is a little larger than the combined areas of New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware. It has Lake Rudolph and Kenya colony to the east, Lake Victoria Nyanza to the south, and Lake Albert Nyanza and the Nile river to the west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A so-called “Christian” country, it was grabbed by the British in 1894, but is allowed selfgovernment in purely native affairs. Much of the climate is unhealthful, and at one time a whole section was depopulated by sleeping sickness. The Nile and the Congo are connected by a road through the heart of “Darkest Africa.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a peculiar native grass, much used by the natives as thatch, which often reaches to a height of twelve feet or over. Big game is plentiful. Iron ore and gold have been found. Uganda has become one of the sources of cotton for the British empire, yielding some 200,000 bales annually. The cotton barons are chiefly natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Buganda natives are very’ intelligent and of good disposition and will doubtless be readily amenable to the truth -when it finally gets to them. All the accessories of civilization are in their possession, automobiles, trucks, bicycles, wireless, good roads, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The capital, Entebbe, is a beautiful little town of bungalows surrounded by well-kept lawns bordering wide streets, shaded from the tropical sun by huge trees. It occupies a peninsula almost surrounded by the blue water of Lake Victoria Nyanza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 339, issue of September 14, 1932, discussed at length the great countries of Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, which lie to the north of Uganda, we do not treat them here, but terminate this part of our story with a little information about</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Ethiopia and the Somalilands</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Tiie nose of Africa turns up instead of down, and so the countries which go to make it are sometimes called “The Eastern Horn of Africa”. The central part of this horn is, of course, Abyssinia, the official name of which is Ethiopia, nominally Christian for fifteen hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Africa was carved up between the great powers it was the intention that Italy should have Abyssinia, and the Italians tried to take it but suffered such a defeat at the battle of Ado-wa, in 1896, that they were glad to stick to the coast, of which the French and British also have portions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abyssinia is extremely mountainous and therefore healthful. Sometime it will make a wonderful country. Its greatest present need is adequate roads. A railroad 495 miles in length penetrates from French Somaliland to the capital at Addis Abeba, which latter place was fixed as the capital in 1892. The train runs up to the capital one week and back the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abyssinia proper is of greater area than all that part of the United States east of the states of Indiana and Kentucky. The royal family claims descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Ethnologists claim that the true Abyssinian type contains no Negro blood whatever and none of the Negro qualities, either mental or physical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The present ruler is an enlightened man. He is trying to put down slavery, but has a hard job ahead of him, owing to the intractability of the various kings and kinglets, speaking some seventy languages, that rule in various parts of his mountain realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The northern part of the Abyssinian coast is called Eritrea. It is in the hands of the Italians, and is of the size of the state of Pennsylvania. French Somaliland, to the east of Eritrea, is of the size of Connecticut. It was presented to the French as a reward foi- rescuing one of the Abyssinian rulers from an Arab prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">British Somaliland, to the east of French Somaliland, was seized in 1898. It is of about the size of the New England states. It was wanted because it controls the Gulf of Aden, at the mouth of the Red sea. The rule is, “If you haven’t got what you want, take it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the subjugation of Somaliland, the British government in the year 1921 resorted to the bombing of native quarters from airplanes in order to accomplish their ends. It does not seem to us that it is any less murder or any less thievery to subjugate a black man's land than it is a white man’s land; and both are alike execrable. In the end “order” was established. Oh yes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Order, the hush of brooding slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peace in the dungeon vaults and graves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Italian Somaliland, at the tip of the horn, or the tip of the nose, is more than twice the size of Italy itself. A delegation of natives recently made a protest to the League of Nations against the overbearing manners, or lack of them, of the Italians. It seems that a Fascist magistrate decided that trousers may be worn only by white men, and the natives want to know if there is any good reason why these Roman Catholic Christians of the tribes of Macaroni, Vermicelli and Spaghetti can keep a black man from wearing the second-hand pair of pants which is his principal investment, adornment and charm.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>What Science Says About Tobacco</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">(I'.y II. N. Pringle, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Twentieth Century Progress')</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN $50,000,000 is expended in one year by a few tobacco trusts in large or colored advertisements to educate the women of America to acquire the habit of smoking and double the tobacco consumption, it is time for a few facts about tobacco. It is pleasing to learn that none resent this false ballyhoo of the greedy trusts more than some dealers in the wholesale tobacco trade. One would infer from some of these cigarette advertisements that a package of fags are far better than cough medicine for a delicate throat; or that cigarette smoking is an undisputed badge of good breeding. Dr. Walter B. Pitkin's book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Art of Learning</span><span class="font8"> (published in 1931) is in such demand at the Carnegie Library and the Congressional Library that for many weeks I was unable to procure one of the five copies to make the following quotations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Proof is at hand that, for the vast majority of men and women, every ounce of tobacco smoked retards and confuses their intellectual work to a degree easily measured in the laboratory. Indeed, it has been so measured, and by highly competent disinterested physicians and psychologists. Probably you have never heard about the researches of the committee of scientists, under the presidency of Dr. Alexander Lambert. Many of the leaders in physiology, neurology, psychology, genetics, economics and social sciences served on that committee. Carefully controlled laboratory tests and statistical surveys were made; and several important monographs published. The two which concern us here are M. V. O’Shea’s sizable book entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tobacco and Mental Efficiency</span><span class="font8"> (1923) and a general committee summary of clinical data entitled ‘Tobacco and Physical Efficiency’ (1927).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The newspapers and magazines have seen to it that few Americans found a fair chance to learn the findings of these works; for the entire periodical press is terrified at the thought of losing their tobacco advertisements as a result of printing anything even faintly adverse to nicotine.” (From pages 127-178) * * * •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All this explains the striking observation made in many colleges that, as J. R. Earp puts it in his study of English university students, ‘although the number of smokers and non-smokers in the college [which he investigated] is practically the same, yet out of 23 students dismissed last year for low scholarship, no less than 21 were smokers. As one ascends the scale of scholarship, the proportion of non-smokers grows steadily greater. And, in general, those who smoke much have lower scholarships than those who smoke little.” (From page 129)</span></p>

Of the political prisoners 491 still remain on the Lipari Islands, despite Mussolini’s bombastic pronunciamento that “Italy appears today as the creator and initiator of a new civilization”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Billy’s intimation that he would like to have the place of God, so that he could give the universe a better management, places him on a par with Lucifer, who also said, “I will be like the Most High.” Neither Lucifer nor Billy will ever get what they crave, but Billy might get to be Lucifer’s heir-apparent, and that is about what he is.</span></p>

Another man, William Hushka, was killed in the same conflict. A small child whose father is an ex-soldicr lies in a Washington hospital dangerously ill as a result of the tear gas thrown by the troops. The soldiers who dispersed the ‘ ‘ Bonus Army ’ ’ from its main encampment at Anacostia, near Washington, used extraordinary and needless brutality. They aroused the veterans, many of whom were accompanied by their wives and children, late at night and forced them to flee immediately from their shelters, which they then burned, destroying much personal property. One child was badly cut with a saber on the knee, and numerous women and children, as well as men, were injured by tear gas thrown while they were doing their best to obey orders and leave the camp. Several thousand persons of both sexes and of all ages hurried off into the night and were given absolutely no shelter.</span></p>

One of the former pastors objected to the present pastor’s assisting girls of eight to twelve years of age to become familiar with the atmosphere of Dreamland Rink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trustees got into an argument about it, and one of the new style trustees punched one of the old style trustees three times, as hard as he could hit him. The third time, in order to make sure that the blow would count, Trustee Edward Shotgen took off his coat, so that Trustee Will Barron (who did not at any time resist) should know he meant business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The new pastor is teaching boys of ten years of age to practice pugilism; he has taken twenty-six of them to see a first-class fight between professionals and has built a prize ring in the church, where they may batter one another up. The board of trustees is now a unit for the methods of the new pastor, and anybody who says anything against them is liable to get something worse than Barron got. The whole church is strong for their father’s way of doing things. —John 8:44.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">rpHE Northeast Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church, at its session at Wooster, Ohio, in September, went on record for socialism in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have organized society around the getting of money and have made wealth the standard by which we have judged success. This dominating urge to gain wealth has led business in the last decade to embark upon such a wild, uncontrolled orgy of production unrelated to consumption needs that our economic system is in a state of collapse. The unprecedented suffering of our day is significant, not only of a situation which cannot be defended morally, but also of one which is economically indefensible. Capitalism as it has operated in our modern world has been weighed and found wanting. The tragedy of the present hour makes imperative a change in our economic system. This system which permits private hands to manipulate for profit the processes which are vital to the wellbeing of all our people must be set aside or so fundamentally changed that the chief end of our economic activity shall be to meet the needs of all. To achieve this end, our financial and industrial systems must be socialized in both ownership and control and these vast natural resources must be utilized, not for the benefit of the few, but for the many.</span></p>

It is considered good business. The newspaper makes something out of it; the doctors and others who helped chip in are more or less pleased at the indirect advertising; it gives one of the clergy a chance to spread himself in a grandiloquent sermon on the value of the church; and, finally, each of the eleven churches listed hopes that somebody may come along and put in the contribution box something that otherwise would not be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There seems to be something a little bit hazy about the heading. Which church is it that is “the rock of ages”, the Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Christian, Christian Science, Lutheran, Episcopal or Catholic? Each denomination taps itself on the chest and says, “It is I.” Is that so? Thought all along it was the eternal God.

<p><span class="font8">We give Mr. Roosevelt an item upon which his new National Economy League might try its hand. It is claimed that for carrying the mails one year from Baltimore to Hamburg the steamship company with which Mr. Archibald B. Roosevelt is connected was paid by the Government $807,246 for service which would have been rendered by other steamship lines for $28,242. Thus to keep Mr. Roosevelt’s line afloat the Government really made him a present of $779,004.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now we do not know whether Mr. Archibald B. Roosevelt, of the National Economy League, is eager to try to cut down the subsidies paid to the steamship line of Archibald B.

During the past year intense interest has been aroused among many as to the cause of the persecution of these humble men and women, followers of Christ, who at their own expense and personal effort go from door to door, telling the people the good news of God’s kingdom, the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In various communities of New Jersey, particularly Bergenfield, Asbury Park, Westfield; also in Westchester county’s first city of White Plains (New York); and in Rockville, Connecticut; in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; in Hillsborough, California, and in many other places, good men and women while engaged in doing their lawful duty in obedience to the command of Jehovah, and while doing good by bringing comfort to the people now in distress, have been ruthlessly arrested, cursed and abused by officers, and otherwise illtreated and thrown into jail, and some into dungeons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fair-minded persons, shocked and stunned by such wrongful acts on the part of public officers, have inquired as to why these harmless men and women are thus persecuted. In response to such inquiry this rexdew is presented here.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark278"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>Jehovah and His witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The men and women who have been thus persecuted and haled before the rulers of the people are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who is Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is the Most High God, the Creator of heaven and earth, the Giver of every thing that is good, and whom every person must know and obey in order to have life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nineteen centuries ago, when the babe Jesus was bora at Bethlehem in Palestine, Jehovah’s angel from heaven announced the event to a group of humble shepherds, saying, ‘Behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which shall be unto all people; He who is to be the King of the world is born and He will bring peace on earth and good will toward men.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since then those who love God and His right-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">250</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">eons government have looked forward to the day of His kingdom and have rejoiced to tell others of its coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The time for the Kingdom is now come. How may we know that fact? The prophecies of Jehovah, plainly recorded in His Word, the Bible, set forth unmistakable evidence by which honest persons may know and understand that the time of God’s kingdom is here. Read, if you will, the record of Daniel (chapter two, verse forty-four). Also note the words of Jesus recorded at Matthew the twenty-fourth chapter, and Luke twenty-one. To His disciples Jesus said that He would come and that His work as King of kings would begin at the time of greatest distress and perplexity on earth, when men’s hearts would be failing them for fear of what they would see approaching, and that at such time wickedness would abound. Every sober-minded person knows that exactly these conditions now prevail all over the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the prophecy of Psalm one hundred ten, Jehovah foretold the beginning of the reign of His King, saying that His Son would commence to exercise His kingly authority and power in the midst of his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning this same time, the Lord commanded His witnesses, saying, ‘This good flews of the Kingdom must now be preached oi' told to the people as a testimony to them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who love God and obey His commandments have no alternative. Their life depends upon faithfully carrying out the command of God. They must tell the people the good news of His kingdom, and they must and will do this as Jehovah’s witnesses, even at the cost of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From House to House</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How are Jehovah’s witnesses to publish this good news of His kingdom? In these momentous days God has brought forward the radio, and by this means some are enabled to hear in the quiet of then* own homes a portion of the message concerning the Kingdom as it is broadcast. Many are anxious to learn more. To enable the people to get a better understanding of Jehovah’s purpose to vindicate His name by making known His glory and power among all who now dwell upon earth, and in obedience to His commandment and because of their love for God and their desire to help the people, Jehovah’s witnesses now go from house to house and offer to the people this message in printed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">form. Thus they give the people an opportunity to study and to understand the purposes of God as written in the Bible. In the same way Jesus and the apostles went from house to house teaching the people.—Matt. 10: 7-15; Acts 20: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To people of good will, Jehovah’s witnesses give also the opportunity to share in the work of publishing this good news of the Kingdom by contributing a small sum of money. The cost of producing and delivering the message in printed form is, of course, far in excess of all such amounts received from some of those to whom the printed message is delivered. Voluntary contributions by others who are anxious to have a share in sending out this good news make possible the continuation and enlargement of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Are these men and women engaged in a bookselling scheme for financial gain, or to earn a livelihood? Most assuredly not. They toil in shop or field to earn their bread. They live frugally and then give all the time and money that they can to publish among the people this good news of God's kingdom, pointing to that righteous government as the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Are these men and women engaged in soliciting donations? No. Are they soliciting contributions of money for themselves or for others ? They certainly are not. The sole object of their activity is to make known or to publish among the people the truth concerning the purpose of God as He now has revealed and interpreted the dark sayings of His Book, the Bible. This is not a commercial work. It is not a propaganda movement to get joiners. It is wholly a constructive work for the permanent welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been charged that some “profit” personally by the use of ‘high-pressure salesmanship’ in the distribution of this printed message. Every honest person who has taken a little time to investigate knows that such charge is wholly untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every one who hears this good news of the kingdom of God and who has a sincere desire to see that righteous government wants to share in spreading this message to others. This is one reason why more than a hundred thirty million of these books have been placed with the people during the past few years. Many in the families so served have been greatly comforted and refreshed by acquiring a knowledge of God’s purposes. This is a work of bringing to the people the truth concerning the worldwide government of Jehovah, which is the only hope of relief for the suffering millions.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark280"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>Chief Enemy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The men and women who love God and righteousness, and who as Jehovah's witnesses are joyfully going from house to house with His message of hope, are the ones that have been abused, arrested and persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They are being thus wrongfully treated because they are the representatives and servants of Jehovah and His kingdom. The chief enemy and opposer of God and His kingdom is Satan the Devil, who first induced man to sin. Throughout the centuries, by the toleration of Jehovah, Satan has built a mighty organization composed of invisible and visible parts. In the Bible (2 Cor. 4:3,4) it is written that Satan is the god of this world, the invisible ruler of the nations of earth, and that he makes every effort through his organization to keep the people of earth in ignorance of the truth.—2 Cor. 11:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus was a mere babe, Herod, then ruler of Palestine, attempted to kill Jesus. That ruler was a representative of the Devil. Had Herod been a representative of God he would not have tried to kill God’s beloved Son Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus became a man and proceeded with the work God gave Him to do among the people of Palestine, the clergy and their immediate associates sought repeatedly to entrap and kill Him. Jesus knew their purpose and spoke to them about it, as written in John chapter eight, verses forty to forty-five: “Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God. ... Ye do the deeds of your father, . . . the devil, . . . [who] was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. . . . And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus plainly did Jesus speak to those who in His day chose to stand with and serve as the visible agents of Satan the false witness and accuser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Jesus’ day, the Pharisees and priests were the clergy, who taught for commandments the precepts and traditions of men and ignored the Word of God. Acting with them were the political leaders, like Herod and Pilate; and also the money changers, masters of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today the people of all nations are oppressed by the mighty organization of the invisible god of this world, Satan, as stated in Revelation twelve, verse twelve. The three visible elements of men that presume to exercise authority are the commercial, the political, and the religious, and of these three the commercial is the most powerful. All three elements are controlled now by the invisible ruler, Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But some might still say that surely the clergy today would not be opposed to the proclamation of the truth as contained in the Bible. The facts show, however, that they are the chief opposers, and that the clergy together with the principal ones of their flocks (the avaricious lords of big business and the political leaders without conscience) are now identifying themselves as servants of God’s enemy Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As in Jesus’ day, so now, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">actions</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">deeds </span><span class="font8">of these men who attempt to suppress the proclamation of the truth of God's Word mark or identify such as sons and servants of Satan.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>Oppression Shall End</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s commandment written in the second and ninth chapters of Ezekiel and in many other prophecies, are now telling the people the truth as set forth in the Bible. They are telling the people throughout all the world that the kingdoms and governments of earth are oppressive because Satan is the invisible ruler. Never before were the peoples of earth oppressed and deliberately deceived as at this time. Every thoughtful person who today calmly views the actions of the governing groups of any and all nations can willingly admit this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are telling the people of the purpose of God, plainly written in His Book, the Bible, that within a short time He will completely destroy Satan’s entire organization, including “organized Christianity”, and that the righteous rule which shall then proceed under His King, Christ Jesus, is the only hope for the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are pointing out the great truth that all obedient ones shall have opportunity then to dwell for ever on earth in peace and happiness and true and permanent prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Zephaniah, chapter three, verses eight and nine, it is written: ‘Wait ye upon me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up for a witness; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same prophecy, the counsel of the Eternal God to those who love righteousness is written in these words: ‘Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you. Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.’—Zeph. 2:2,3.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>“Publish . . . Conceal Not”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">If the message Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to the people is true, then it is of greatest importance to mankind. If it is false, then it is the duty of the clergymen and others who support them to come boldly forward and plainly tell the people wherein the message is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past year one of Jehovah’s witnesses, Judge Rutherford, challenged the combined clergy of America to select their best man to debate this question by radio. Charged with misrepresenting God and serving Satan the Devil, these clergymen ought either to come forward and prove the falsity of the charge or, failing in that, to cease and desist from holding themselves out as teachers of the Word of God. Jehovah foretold the outcome of such a challenge and the attitude that would be assumed by the clergy, when He caused His prophet Jeremiah to write, at chapter fifty-one, verse thirty: “The mighty men of Babylon [Satan’s organization] have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed.” It is well that all God-fearing persons take note of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy deny that these truths are contained in the Bible. Furthermore, the clergy deliberately conspire to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from pointing out among the people that these great truths are set forth in the Word of God. The people have a right to know whether this is the truth, and therefore have a right to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to the command of the Most High God, now carry this true message to the people. This they do with everincreasing joy. This they are glad to do in the face of threats of imprisonment and physical violence. The joy of Jehovah is their strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even in prison, unfortunate ones are greatly comforted by Jehovah's witnesses when they also are behind the bars for a season. To them the words of Jehovah’s command, as written in Ezekiel, chapter two, are clear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'Jehovah said unto me, ... I send thee . . . to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day. For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>“Why Not Ask Permission?”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">When they enter a town or city, why do not Jehovah’s witnesses ask ''permission” to preach the good news of the kingdom of Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are a number of good reasons. Most important of these is, because the order or command to Jehovah’s witnesses to do this work among the peoples of every nation has come not from men, but from the Almighty Creator through His chief executive officer, the King of kings, Christ Jesus.—Ps. G8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another good reason is, that no thoughtful person would wish for a moment to be in the position of attempting to allow or to prevent that which the Higher Powers, Jehovah and His King, have commanded their willing servants to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For a long time, even to this day, faithless men have erroneously taught that every one must be subject to the “powers that be”. Kings and other rulers have been falsely taught by the clergy. The clergy have misled the kings, presidents and other political masters to believe that they rule “by divine right” and that they are ‘the powers ordained of God’. The Bible plainly declares that the Higher Powers to which every soul shall now be subject and obedient are Jehovah, the living God, and His King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses claim the right to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom by carrying that message in printed form from house to house. Such is their God-given right. More than that, it is their God-given duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But even the man-made constitution of the United States, and of New Jersey, New York, and other states, specifically and plainly prohibits the law-making and the law-enforcing agencies from enacting or attempting to enforce laws that interfere with the right of any person to perform acts and duties commanded by the Almighty God, the Supreme Authority. Thus, for example, the constitution of New Jersey restricts the conduct of law-making and law-enforcing agents of the state in these words: “No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshiping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In some cases written notice of the intention of Jehovah’s witnesses to do their work is presented in advance to the public officers, together with a list of the names and addresses of all who take part in the work. No request for “permission” to do their lawful work is made in such cases. They do, however, request that they 'be permitted to do the work without any interference’. In other words, they invite the public officers to take notice that a good work will be performed among the people of the city and that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">any interference with the performance of that work</span><span class="font8"> becomes naturally a proper matter for police attention.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark288"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark289"></a>The Supreme Law</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">All the courts recognize that Jehovah’s law is higher than man’s law. Jesus foretold (Mark 13:9) that in the time of the end, where we now are, His followers would be brought before kings and rulers for His sake, “for a testimony against them [the kings and rulers].” In the Scriptures is foretold also that the time would come when there would be but one law, as stated in Isaiah, chapter two. It follows then that man cannot rightfully pass a law that could prevent the preaching of the gospel or good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. Naturally, no town or city, state or other human law-making or law-enforcing agency can require or grant a permit to do a thing which it cannot rightfully prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is due the people to know that in some communities where Jehovah’s witnesses have been most viciously persecuted by the clergy and their misguided associates among the political leaders these opposers have deliberately taken counsel together to frame ordinances for the very purpose of obstructing the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. This is particularly true of Bergenfield, New Jersey. It is admittedly true of Englewood, New Jersey. On behalf of the latter place the boast was made by one of these wicked counselors that ‘they would spend all the money in the world to have their ordinance upheld’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such conduct is most reprehensible in the sight of Jehovah, the living God, as stated in His Word at Psalm ninety-four. There it is plainly foretold that in this very time, before the vengeance of God is poured out upon such foolish conspirators, they would ‘frame mischief by a law’ and ‘gather themselves together against the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood’; but it is also stated in the same Psalm that Jehovah shall bring upon the conspirators their own lawlessness and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; ‘yea, Jehovah our God shall cut them off.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The time is here, as the Scriptures also show, for Jehovah’s witnesses to declare among all people the purpose of the Almighty God. It is written, in Jeremiah, chapter twenty-five: ‘Therefore prophesy thou against them all those words, and say unto them, Jehovah shall roai' from on high, and utter his voice from bis holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith J ehovah.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last seven verses of the twenty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah plainly reveal what every honest person longs to see, namely, that the Almighty Creator Himself will move like a whirlwind against the peoples’ oppressors. They shall be positively cornered, with no way to flee or escape. These oppressors, as shown in God’s prophecy, are the hypocritical clergy, and the avaricious masters of big business and the politicians without conscience who are the principal members of the flocks of the false shepherds, and who now all work hand in hand behind the scenes, under the supervision and control of their invisible overlord, Satan, “that old serpent” the Devil.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark290"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>“We . . . </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shall Laugh”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The people are now entitled to know the meaning of such prophecies as that which Jehovah caused to be written and which is known commonly as the second Psalm. It begins: ‘Why do the nations tumultuously assemble, and the people meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then it is written that the Almighty Creator will laugh at those who attempt to stand in the way of His work: “He that sittefh in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of this, as the Psalm shows, is due to be done after Jehovah commands His Son, Christ Jesus, to begin to rule in the midst of His enemies. That time is now here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the sober consideration of those individuals who hold positions of leadership among the people, the counsel of the Eternal God is written in the last words of the second Psalm: ‘Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As human creatures, Jehovah’s witnesses are of small importance, but Jehovah and His kingdom are of supreme importance. Jehovah God is sending forth His message of His kingdom by His witnesses now. He who opposes does so at his peril. Those who learn and obey the righteous law of the kingdom of Jehovah will have nothing to fear. Such shall learn more and more of the glory and majesty of Jehovah, the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and of His Son the King of kings. From the rising of the sun unto its going down they will unceasingly praise the Eternal God as they live everlastingly in peace, happiness and prosperity.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark292"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark293"></a>“This Gospel”—In How Many Languages?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">X ANSWER to an inquiry as to the number of languages in which “this gospel of the kingdom’’ must be preached before the scripture will be fulfilled which says it must be for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“t\ </span><span class="font8">witness to all nations”, we answered a correspondent as follows, and presume the reply will be of some general interest to others:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In reply to your favor of October 11. There are about 3,500 languages now spoken in the world, and it is a fact, as stated in your letter, that about onefourth of these have been reduced to writing and some portion of the Scriptures printed therein. There are districts in Burma and other parts of the world where one may not go more than thirty miles without contact with a new language, different in many respects from the one in use in the region just left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When our Lord said, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations,” it would not seem reasonable to us to understand that He expects the true explanation of the Scriptures, or even the Scriptures themselves, or any part of them, must necessarily be translated into every one of these 3,500 tongues. Even if they were so translated the natives could not read them, and even if they could read, they could not understand them. In some parts of the world, as in sections of Africa, the language of the natives is little more than a succession of clicks. In China a word which is written the same may have as many as eight different pronunciations and each of these eight variously pronounced words has a different meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even if it were possible to reduce all present languages to writing and to print the Bible and explanations of the Bible in all these languages, and even if all the people could read, and reading, could understand, we would stil<sup>1</sup> have to reckon with the fact that hundreds of nations and other languages that once flourished no longer exist. We thus see that our Lord’s statement, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations” does not mean and could not mean that it would be proclaimed in every language and in every dialect of the present and of the past. What is manifestly meant is that the entire earth has been divided for governmental purposes into some seventy nations and it is God’s evident will that this gospel of the Kingdom should be particularly proclaimed to these nations that have thus taken over the earth and its bounties and have assumed to reign in God’s name. In many of these nations English is the governing tongue, in others Spanish, and in others French. Thus we finally arrive at the fact that in order to preach the gospel for a witness unto all nations it is necessary only that it be published in about thirty languages, as is now done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">130 MILLION </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">copies of Judge Rutherford’s books and booklets distributed in ten years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can you imagine such a large quantity of literature as being distributed in so short a period of time? And remember, too, three of these years were years of great depression and the other years in many countries were not very prosperous. The people generally have always been oppressed, but the publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society written by Judge Rutherford have been obtained by these people because they set forth the people’s only hope, which lies in the kingdom of God established upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The books written and published during the past ten years by this Society have reached a total of upward of 130 million copies. If we could figure three persons to each copy that has gone out, that would be equivalent to 390 million persons who have had an opportunity to receive the truth. The census bureau figures five persons to each family. However, it is not so important as to the number that have been distributed, but how much advertising has been done for the great Jehovah God, His kingdom, and His beloved Son, the King. In 1922 the song went forth, “Advertise the King and Kingdom.” The Lord has done this very thing. In but one year, the year of greatest depression and unrest, more than 22 million copies of literature advertising Jehovah’s kingdom have been distributed. Wouldn’t you like to know how, where and why such a tremendous distribution has taken place in this past year ? The YEAR BOOK brings to your attention in a most interesting fashion a report, written by Judge Rutherford, of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth. The detailed account of the work accomplished in the different lands is fascinating, and we feel sure that all who desire the kingdom of God will be interested in the YEAR BOOK and this most splendid report. Additionally, the YEAR BOOK contains a daily text and a comment which will be of great help to students of the Scriptures. Why not write now for your copy?</span></p>

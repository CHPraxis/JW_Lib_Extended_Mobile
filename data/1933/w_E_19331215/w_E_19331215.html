<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC LECTURES BY TRANSCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s blessing has been markedly upon the use of the portable transcription .machine. He has plainly manifested that this machine meets the need of the hour, when the enemy, under Gog, is seeking to curtail the use of the radio by God’s anointed and when the people’s ears are eager to hear, not man’s message, but God’s. The transcription machine has increased the power of Jehovah’s witnesses afield to preach His truth manyfold, so that the desire for the literature is stimulated and study classes of many interested hearers are being formed. Besides more than 300 such machines in the United States alone, great numbers are now being effectively used in countries near and afar. For more information, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE 1934 CALENDAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society’s calendar for 1934 will be a beautiful adornment and help in the homes of all interested in Jehovah’s purposes at this time. Not only is the year’s text set forth, but a magnificent picture expressive thereof, and also a special message from the president of the Society. The date pad indicates the periods of special world-wide witnessing arranged for the year. The Calendar may be had at 25c a copy; or, in lots of 5 or more, at 20c apiece. Members of companies may avail themselves of this latter rate by placing their orders with their stockkecpcr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YEAR BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> for 1934 is now m course of preparation. It is hoped to begin mailing it in time for Jehovah’s witnesses to be using it promptly with the opening of the new calendar year. The Society has had the grandest and most intense and effective service year of its history, and the annual report thereon as compiled by the president will be sure to delight all who have the kingdom interests at heart. Also, there will be a pointed discussion of the 1934 year text, and a text and appropriate comment for each day of the year. The book is offered at 50c a copy, mailed anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remittance to cover should accompany each order. Company members will place their orders with the local stockkeeper, that he may send in a group order. This will reduce the shipping costs and also expedite the filling of orders here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNOUNCING COMPANY MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many hearers of radio transcription lectures have the desire to meet with Jehovah’s witnesses and to study his Word with them. Hence wherever the kingdom message is radiocast, the time and place of meeting of the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses should be announced after the transcription. The time on the air being paid for, the station manager ought to readily grant your request to make such announcement.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark4"></a>REFUGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“l will love thee, 0 Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall 1 be saved from mine ene</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mies.”—Ps. 18:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has provided complete refuge for those who love him, but for no others. These “last days’’ are strenuous and fraught with great danger, because the climax is at hand. The enemy is bending every effort to accomplish the destruction of those who serve God. Rather than see any human serve Jehovah, Satan would now destroy the entire human race. His wrath is especially directed against Jehovah’s witnesses because they are bringing the testimony of the truth to the people in obedience to God’s commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Almost all of the nation of Israel turned away from God because that people did not love God; and necessarily the nation suffered destruction. “Christendom” is against Jehovah God because it does not love him; and it shall suffer destruction. Only the true Judeans can now sing with sincerity the words of the eighteenth Psalm. These singers in spiritual Israel know that the name of Jehovah is a strong tower of refuge for them, and into which they run for safety. It is in these latter days that we have come to appreciate that “whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope”. (Rom. 15:4) Long ago Jehovah purposed that the prophecies should be for the comfort and hope of his remnant people, and now he is giving to the faithful an understanding of his prophecies; and those who understand and obey him are the ones who take a wise course. The one thing that the wise do and will continue to do is to love Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMANDMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The great commandment, which is first in time and first in importance, is that the creature must love Jehovah God. This question was propounded to Jesus: “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?” The answer of Jesus proves that there is one primary commandment: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (Matt. 22: 36-40) This commandment Jehovah made of paramount importance, and it is emphasized by the wicked challenge flung into the face of Jehovah by Satan the Devil. When God had led Israel out of Egypt he gave this commandment to his people, that they must love him if they would live, and then added: ‘ Ye shall not go after other gods, as ye shall be diligent to keep the commandments of the Lord thy God.’ (I)cut. 6: 5-17) Secondary to the great commandment Jesus says: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”; no more and no less. All the law and the prophets depend upon these commandments, because a failure to keep these would make the keeping of others of no real value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* Often the phrase is used, “We must love God supremely.” That expression is unscriptural, for the reason that there is no qualification or limitation to the love of the creature for Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Love</span><span class="font3"> means to be unselfishly and wholly devoted to Jehovah God without qualification or compromise. There can be no division of one’s love, part being given to Jehovah, and part to a creature. If one’s own self stands in his way or interferes with his love for Jehovah, then self must be put on the side. If one’s neighbor or any creature stands in the way of complete devotion to Jehovah, that neighbor or other creature must be put aside. No one can please God who permits love for husband, wife, parents, children or others to interfere with complete devotion to Jehovah God. No one can have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name unless that person loves Jehovah; and only those who vindicate Jehovah’s name shall live. The followers of Christ must love their brethren. But how ? As one loves himself, Jesus answers. That means to deal justly with your brother, doing good unto him even as you would have him to do good unto you. Jesus thus defined that second commandment. “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” (Matt. 7:12) Men often permit selfishness, or love for self, to stand in their way of full devotion to and service to Jehovah. This should no</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">more be permitted than to permit love for any other creature to stand in the way of service to Jehovah. The true disciple of Jesus Christ must take the same course that Jesus took as a man; which was unqualified devotion to the Almighty God. “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:25,26) “He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.” (John 12:25) These texts show that there can be no words of qualification added to the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font3"> when applied to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPINION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Frequently one who is in a covenant with Jehovah finds himself disturbed by the opinion expressed of him by other creatures. If the follower of Christ desires the approval of men he is certain to become disturbed and discouraged. What man’s opinion is of and concerning another is wholly immaterial. Whatsoever is God’s finding concerning the creature is of all importance to him. The approval of Jehovah is the only thing worth while. If one is wholly devoted to God he will not become discouraged by reason of what others may say or think of him. To hold the office of “elective elder” was a great desire of many, not so much that they might serve God better, but that their brethren might highly esteem them and honor them. When the Lord revealed to his people recently that elders in fact are not so made by votes of men but by their maturity in Christ, the election of elders ceased. Thereafter some who had held the office of “elective elder” concluded that their brethren in the company or congregation did not regard them as highly as they should be regarded, and that state of mind or condition brought grief to the one who desired to be esteemed. One might say: ‘ ‘ My brethren have set me aside and do not give me opportunities to discourse before the company as once I did, and I am in sorrow by reason thereof.” Such is entirely a wrong view of the matter. Rather one should ask: “Has the Lord opened a way for me to serve? and if so, I shall gladly embrace such opportunities, that I may please my God. ’ ’ When one knows he is diligent in obeying God’s commandments, and that he has the approval of Jehovah, the esteem or lack of esteem in which others hold him is wholly immaterial. “That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” (Luke 16:15) The reason is this: Satan has undertaken to turn all men against Jehovah, declaring that no man will be wholly faithful and true to Jehovah God; and therefore devotion or high esteem of the creature is to that extent a support of Satan’s side of the controversy. The approval of God is what one must have in order to be safe.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">® These are perilous days, because the end of the world has come, and the great question of supremacy must shortly be settled. Only those who love Jehovah God will escape and find a complete refuge under the Almighty’s protection. Those who love God and who are of the temple know that all things shall work together for their good. (Rom. 8: 28) No others know that comforting truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LOVE OF MONEY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> With divine authority the apostle wrote: “The love of money is the root of all evil.” Money is a medium for the measuring of value or for carrying on merchandise. The merchant or trader is one who traffics in material things for selfish gain. The definition of the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">money</span><span class="font3"> cannot be properly limited to the coin of the realm or to the thing which is used as a medium of exchange or measure of value. “Money,” within the meaning of the scripture, is that which is a measure of personal gain or which brings gain to the person. It may be gold and silver or the approval and honor of men, or the gain of influence and power over others. One who is moved by a desire for selfish gain is avaricious and covetous; which is contrary to the spirit of God and is the expression of the spirit of the DeviL</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EXAMPLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Adam was selfish. He did not love God; otherwise he would have obeyed him. He did not love Eve, because it was his selfish desire to have and retain that which pleased him that induced him to selfishly join her in the transgression; and for that reason he was not deceived. The fact that he disobeyed God’s commandment is conclusive proof of his selfishness or lack of love for Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Lucifer did not love Jehovah God. He was selfish, avaricious and covetous. (Jer. 51:13) His selfish desire for personal gain induced him to sin and to further defy the Almighty God. He had no fear for Jehovah God, and therefore he did not even begin to be wise according to divine wisdom. He challenged Jehovah God to put a man on earth who would remain true to God under adverse conditions, and he wickedly said to Jehovah that man under stress would curse God to his face. Jehovah permitted Satan to try his hand in carrying out his boastful challenge, and His primary purpose in so doing was and is the vindication of the holy name of Jehovah before all creatures. All, therefore, must have an opportunity to know Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> It was the love for money or that which money represents that started Satan on his wicked course. Satan began to make merchandise of the human race for his own personal gain, and therefore that was the beginning or root of evil. He foresaw rising from the fountain of perfect man and woman a sea of human creatures, and he determined to use them for his own personal gain; hence he commercialized and trafficked in the human race. When mankind had grown in numbers Satan brooded over that symbolic sea of human creatures and brought forth the -wicked beastly organization by which he has since ruled the world. In his organization he has made prominent three elements, to wit, commerce, religion and politics; and with this organization, all of which is mercantile, Satan has filled the earth with violence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGION COMMERCIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> All religious organizations of the world are commercial, for the reason that all such organizations are created and carried on for the personal gain of Satan and his dupes and to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Beginning on the plains of Shinar Satan organized a religion the express purpose of which was selfish gain to Satan and to the people, and to the turning of man away from God. (Gen. 11:1-9) The religion of the world is commercial, for the reason that it is a primary means employed by Satan to traffic in human flesh and blood. Selfishness, or love for self and self-gain, led the people at Shinar into Satan’s trap. From that day until now every religion of the world, regardless of the name of it, has been organized and carried forward for the selfish gain of creatures, and therefore all such religions are commercial and employed as instruments by Satan. This is corroborative proof that “the love of money [or selfish gain] is the root of all evil”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The desire for selfish gain, or love for money, has caused the earth to be filled with violence. When God created Lucifer and made him the overlord of man Lucifer was perfect, and that perfection continued until iniquity came into his mind. That iniquity was love for money or selfish gain; and he prosecuted his enterprise by all mercantile and commercial means. God caused his prophet to make a record thereof in these words: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.” (Ezek. 28:15,16,18) Instead of love being manifest by Lucifer for Jehovah, selfish gain or the love of money moved him into action.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The sanctuaries of Lucifer, both invisible and visible to human eyes, he defiled by his wicked acts induced by his desire for selfish gain. He has trafficked in angels and men, and by so doing he has surrounded himself with and filled his organization with violence and has defamed Jehovah’s name; and all this he has done because of his insatiable desire for personal gain.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VIOLENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> All the violence of earth may be properly laid to commercial religion, for the reason that all world religions have been used for the selfish gain of creatures, and not one of them for the honor of Jehovah’s name. Wherever commerce itself has gone there has been a form of religion accompanying it to furnish a sanctimonious screen behind which Satan has operated. Of course, Jehovah foreknew that the only safety for his chosen people Israel was for them to love him. Therefore he commanded them: ‘ ‘ And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.” (Deut. 6:5) Had they strictly obeyed that commandment, that people would have been safe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Ancient Tyre was a great stronghold of the sea, that is to say, a strong commercial organization that controlled the traffic amongst the peoples of the earth, on the sea as well as on land. (Isa. 23: 4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The king of Tyre represented the Devil in person, while the princes of Tyre stood symbolically for the earthly leaders in Satan’s visible organization. The chosen people of Jehovah, the Israelites, instead of remaining true and faithful to Jehovah God and to their covenant with him, fell away from God and followed in the way of commercial Tyre, and this they did for selfish gain. Even to this day the Jews are the greatest merchants in the earth, and it is selfish gain that leads them in that course and causes them to ignore Jehovah and his Word. The turning away of the Jews from Jehovah and the turning to the Devil brought great violence upon themselves as well as upon others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> In due time Christ Jesus came to the earth as the servant of Jehovah and the great Witness of the Almighty, and to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name. He taught the Jews and established amongst them the true worship of Jehovah God. The Jews, instead of receiving the Son of God in a proper way, heaped great violence and abuse upon Christ Jesus and upon his faithful apostles, and in doing this they were prompted or moved by the desire for selfish gain. Satan led them into selfishness and completely away from God and their covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> In the days of the apostles no one was called pope, but all who faithfully served God and his beloved Son recognized Christ Jesus as the Head over his church, which is his body. (Eph. 1: 22, 23) Years after the passing away of the apostles there was organized a religion which was falsely labeled “the Christian religion”, otherwise called “the Christian church”, and an imperfect man was made the head of it and he was called “pope” or “father”, contrary to the Scriptures; and such organization has claimed to be the greatest religious organization ever on earth. The papal or Catholic religion was not organized nor has it been carried on for the purpose of giving honor and glory to the name of Jehovah God, but solely for the purpose of selfish gain of creatures. Its leaders boast that its numbers are counted by the millions. It counts its numbers and its property which it has as “godliness”. The papal religion at all times has been and is a commercial instrument of Satan, and has filled the earth with great violence, and this has been done because of its love for money or selfish gain. The cruel and wicked persecution of others, the loathsome and wicked inquisition, and the blasphemous boasting of the leaders in that organization are all manifestations of wickedness, violence and extreme selfishness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> In later years another religious organization came upon the scene, assumed the name of God and Christ, and labeled itself ‘ ‘ the Protestant Christian religion ’ ’. Regardless of how many sincere men have been and are in that organization, it has never been used to the glory and honor of Jehovah’s name, but always for a selfish purpose or selfish gain. Like the Papacy, it has taught and teaches the people that Jehovah God has prepared a lake of burning fire wherein he will torment millions of his creatures, but that those who believe on Christ and unite themselves with the Protestant church will escape such eternal torment and find life in heaven. Such doctrines are selfish, because they look only to the benefit of the creature. Nothing is done to the honor and vindication of the Creator. On the contrary, such doctrines as above mentioned are a defamation of God’s holy name and turn honest men away from him. Satan has used the Catholic and the Protestant church organizations to fill the earth with violence and oppression, and the root of all such wickedness has been and is the love for money or the desire for personal gain. The many wars that have been fought between Catholics and Protestants were not intended for the honor of Jehovah’s name, but for the selfish gain of creatures.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ELIJAH PERIOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> From about 1874 to 1918 is known amongst God’s people as “the Elijah period of the church”. Within that period of time the true followers of Christ Jesus preached chiefly the doctrines: “No place of eternal torment; a ransom for all made sure by the shed blood of Jesus Christ; and the restoration of the masses of mankind to perfection on earth. ’ ’ But let it be noted that the name of Jesus was magnified more than that of Jehovah and the doctrines brought to the fore looked to the benefit of the creature. In addition to the above the doctrine, which is true, of course, was magnified, to wit: That God is selecting his church from amongst men, which in due time would be highly rewarded by immortality and reign with Christ Jesus for the purpose of blessing all the families of the earth. This was magnified for the benefit of the creature, and to that degree was selfish. The name of Jehovah God and the vindication thereof was not even considered. The net result was that within that period of time two classes of persons walked side by side by claiming to serve God and Christ. One of these classes stressed the importance of “character development”, deeming that to be great gain and therefore godliness, because ‘it would insure the developer a place in heaven’. The other class, meek and humble, was made up of those anxious to serve God and Christ and to do with their might whatsoever their hands found to be done, desiring only to please the Lord; and while these looked forward also to a place in heaven, and that properly, their chief and great desire was to serve Jehovah and Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JUDGMENT DAY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Now God’s people discern that in 1918 Christ Jesus, the great Judge and executive officer of Jehovah, came to the temple for judgment. Then and there the two classes began to be made manifest, to wit, the class that had been moved by selfishness, and which class quickly developed into the “evil servant” class; and the other, moved by unselfish devotion to God and to his kingdom, and which class Jesus formed into the “faithful and wise servant”. It is to this faithful class that the Lord has committed his testimony on earth, and he invites them to enter into his joy, which is the joy of the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The words of the Lord Jesus Christ at all times are to the honor of Jehovah’s name. When on earth he refused to speak anything except as the instrument of his Father, and that to the honor of his Father. His doctrines at all times are according to godliness, that is to say, always to the vindication of Jehovah God’s Word and name, which means a course of complete righteousness. Those who during the Elijah period of the church claimed to be followers of Christ Jesus and to teach the truth and who are moved by selfishness, such as character development and honor amongst men, have now fully rejected the doctrine concerning the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple in 1918. They claim that the “faithful and wise servant ’ ’ is one man, and they prefer to follow the teachings of one man rather than to take the Word of God as He reveals it to men. They indulge in severe criticism of the remnant, and they oppose the work of the Lord’s servant class in delivering the message of the kingdom and therefore have specifically rejected the words of Jesus that this gospel of the kingdom must be preached as a witness to the nations. (Matt. 24:14) They pride themselves on adhering only to what they learned prior to 1916, and they continue to dote on questions concerning chronology, the development of character, and their importance in helping Jehovah run the universe, presuming that their selfish gain in these personal attainments, including such things as meekness and quietness, “good words and fair speeches,” and sanctimonious appearance, “is godliness.” Manifestly such are moved by the selfish desire for selfish gain rather than the desire for a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. That selfish desire for personal gain makes all religions and professions of religions commercial things. Both the facts and the Scriptures therefore show that the religion of the world is a commercial instrument in Satan’s hands to defame Jehovah and turn men away from him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The spirit of selfishness was apparent in the days of the apostles ■ and in the present time selfishness is more rampant than ever, and concerning which the apostle wrote: “ If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself.” (1 Tim. 6: 3-5) The words of the apostles have applied since written, but with stronger force is their application at the present day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> In the above text the apostle admonishes all who will please God and find complete refuge in him that they must separate themselves from all who are moved by a desire for selfish gain, whether that selfish gain be the accumulation of earthly wealth and power or a gain that comes by the honor, plaudits and approval of men and causes the gainer to shine amongst men. The apostle therefore distinctly points out that those who will receive God’s approval and find in his name a complete refuge must separate themselves from all others that pursue a selfish course; and thus the faithful ones mark themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses and the targets of the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> After the Lord revealed to his people that the cleansing of his sanctuary means the removal of all who profess his name but who are prompted or actuated by selfishness, there still come forward some who insist that they should be elected as elders in the congregation or company and be permitted to parade their personal virtues before their brethren of the congregation. They consider such to be gain to them by having the approval of the company manifested by their votes and thus giving to them a preferential position, and they consider such gain is evidence of “godliness”. The apostle positively negatives the claim that personal gain at any time is godliness. Then he adds: “But godliness with contentment is great gain. ’ ’ 1 Tim. 6: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> “Godliness” means to be entirely and wholly devoted to the cause of the gospel, the purpose of which is the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. If the child of God finds himself devoting himself in obedience to God’s commandment to that which will vindicate the name of the Most High, and that he is doing so unselfishly, and that he is contented with that which the Lord has given him, such to him is great gain, because it is to such that Jehovah promises complete refuge in the time of stress and ultimately a share in the blessings of life everlasting. One who seeks these things from a selfish viewpoint is not pleasing to God, but one who unselfishly seeks to please God will personally benefit from God’s blessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> What, then, is the root of all such evil or lawlessness? The inspired writer replies: “For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” (1 Tim. 6:10) That which will satisfy the desire for personal gain is the root of all evil. Now looking back over the history of the human race we see that the words of the apostle apply to all who have selfishly taken a position in opposition to Jehovah’s declared purpose. For the creature to ignore the Creator and pursue a course that he hopes will bring him personal gain means to pursue an evil course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2r</sup> The desire for personal gain is a temptation and a snare, often resulting in destruction. When a man is called of the Lord God and assigned to a place in his service he has received a great favor at the hands of Jehovah. He is now in a covenant to do the will of God, which means to use his faculties in the service of the Most High. If now he is moved by a selfish desire for greater personal ease for himself or others and, to realize this desire, he leaves the Lord’s service and engages in a worldly business or enterprise, he walks right into the snare of the enemy, which often causes the one taking this course to be ‘drowned in the sea’. By “the sea” is meant the peoples of earth alienated from God, which bear up and give support to Satan’s organization; and where one of his own volition leaves the service of the Lord, when the Lord has assigned him to a place, and returns to the commercial pursuits in Satan’s organization, he is almost certain to be ‘drowned in the sea’. This is the class referred to that will not be awakened until the end of the thousand years. (Rev. 20:13) That which lies at the root of all evil and evil results to those who have once started in the way of serving God is the “love of money”, that is to say, the desire for selfish gain, regardless of what that gain may be. If the truth finds a man with the obligation on his hands of supporting his family by engaging in some commercial pursuit, he is justified in remaining in that position, provided he can do no better to make provision for the things decent and honest for those dependent upon him. (1 Cor. 7:20; Rom. 12:17; 1 Tim. 5:8) But if the Lord provides for him and those dependent upon him and at the same time puts him in a position of service to the Lord, then faithfulness to the Lord would mean that he must remain steadfastly in the service of the Lord and not take a contrary course to satisfy some selfish desire.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WARFARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The remnant of God’s people on earth, which constitute the “faithful and wise servant” class, must continue to preach the gospel, because unto them this privilege has been committed by the Lord. For this reason Satan goes forth to make war against the remnant and to seek their destruction. (Rev. 12:17) This is another evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses have the approval of the Lord God and that all religions, religious workers and other agencies that oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in giving testimony to the kingdom are commercial organizations and are carried forward under the deceptive influence and direction of Satan for the purpose of defaming Jehovah’s name and turning men away from God. Now the facts show beyond all question of doubt that the Papal religious system, the Protestant religious organization, the “evil servant’’ class or “man of sin’’, and all other institutions of Satan’s commercial organization, are in a conspiracy against Jehovah’s “faithful servant” class. The Devil knows that the “faithful servant” class are God’s representatives and prospective members of Jehovah’s new nation. Therefore Satan seeks to prevent such from becoming a nation. This was foretold by the prophet of Jehovah in these words: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation • that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.” (Ps. 83^2-5) That wicked conspiracy is led by Gog, the chief agent of the Devil, and in time the conspiracy is certain to fail. Jehovah has given his word that Satan, who by his iniquity of traffic has filled the earth with violence, together with all of his agents and organization, shall fall at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. The violence revealed against Jehovah ’s witnesses at the present time by the combined forces of Satan will not discourage the faithful ones. On the contrary, it is to the enemy a token of perdition, but unto the faithful a token of salvation and full protection at the hands of Jehovah God.—Phil. 1:28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is carried on particularly in those countries that claim to be Christian, and by means of organizations and the action of men who profess to be followers of Christ. Why, then, does Jehovah permit his anointed thus to suffer persecution ? Manifestly there are two separate and distinct reasons: one is, to give those who are opposing God’s kingdom an opportunity to identify and to mark themselves, evqn as Jehu caused the Baal worshipers in his day to identify themselves; another reason is that such persecution affords the opportunity to Jehovah’s witnesses to prove their love and complete devotion to Jehovah. Christ Jesus, the Head of the anointed One, suffered the contradiction of sinners, and likewise the faithful remnant must suffer. Otherwise they could have no part in the vindication of his name and the carrying out of Jehovah’s purposes.—2 Tim. 2:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The issue is joined and must now be finally settled. Jehovah has builded up Zion, and so now he declares that the fight is on and will continue to the end. “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the rignt-eousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.” (Isa. 62:1) This conflict causes one division of the human race to identify themselves as against God, and others to prove their integrity toward God and to take their respective places before Armageddon. It is at the present time that the words of Jehovah apply to the faithful remnant, to wit: ‘ ‘ Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.” (Isa. 62:3) The kingdom of heaven is here, because Christ has begun his reign. Those of the remnant still on the earth must expect tribulation, because it is written that “we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God”. (Acts 14:22) But those who have taken the name of Jehovah and who prove their love for him by joyfully keeping his commandments shall not fall, but shall gain the victory through Christ. The honor of his name Jehovah has conferred upon the temple company of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and to all such “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe”. That means that the promise of refuge and safety is to the anointed and that safety is in the name of Jehovah. His precious promises were written particularly for the comfort of the remnant, and among these promises tne words of the prophet apply to the remnant, to wit: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress ; my God; in him will I trust. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”—Ps. 91:1, 2, 9-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JONADAB</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The people of good will now on earth who have a desire to know and to obey God were foreshadowed by Jonadab, who accompanied Jehu that he might observe the zeal of Jehu for Jehovah. Jonadab rode with Jehu in his chariot, foreshadowing the fact that the Jonadab class now join Jehovah’s organization and thus identify themselves as being on the Lord's side. (2 Ki. 10:15,16) Jonadab was not an Israelite. He was a Rechabite of the Kenites of the tribe of Midian, which people entered the land of Canaan with the Israelites. To them the Devil worship was offensive. They showed much more zeal and faith in God than many professed Israelites did, and this foreshadowed that the present-day people of good will have more faith in God than the professed ones in the so-called “Christian” organization. (Jer. 35:2-16) The faithfulness and devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses in delivering the testimony concerning the kingdom is partly for the benefit of the Jonadab class, and these should be invited to join in the work of proclaiming the name of Jehovah. Remember the words of Jesus: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” (Rev. 22:17) Whenever those of the Jonadab class wish to have a part in bearing testimony to the truth encourage them so to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> David was a type of the anointed of Jehovah, which necessarily includes the faithful remnant. He fought the enemies of God, and God gave him the victory over the enemy. In that he was a type of Christ Jesus, the great Warrior who will shortly engage the enemy in final conflict and gain a complete victory. There were giants who fought against David and against his servants and whom David and his servants destroyed. The last of those giants was “a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number”. (2 Sam. 21: 20) That giant symbolically represented Satan and his imperfect organization now marching against Jehovah’s anointed, and the result will be the destruction of the enemy, even as the giant was destroyed. The eighteenth Psalm is a song of triumph, recounting first the efforts of the enemy to destroy God’s anointed, and then Jehovah’s protection and deliverance of those who love him. The anointed are permitted to have an appreciation of this Psalm just before the great battle is fought, and therefore the anointed remnant sing: “In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.” (Psalm 18: 6-10) The prophetic song then shows the deliverance of the anointed from the enemy and the reason why Jehovah exercises his power in their behalf: “The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ps. 18:20,21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> The hands of the anointed cannot remain clean if they ‘touch the unclean thing’, that is to say, Satan’s organization. There can be nothing in common between the Lord's people and the enemy organization. The witnesses of Jehovah are God’s people taken out for his name, and they must remain true and faithful to his name. Their love for him can have no qualification or limitation. They must and will give Jehovah all their love. Thus the apostle expresses it in behalf of himself and his brethren, who are devoted to Jehovah: “As it is written, For th.v sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, noi’ powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” —Rom. 8:36-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Lot Jehovah's witnesses be of good courage and continue to rejoice regardless of all the persecution and tribulation that comes upon them, keeping in mind always that they are the servants of the Almighty God and that he is their refuge. Those who keep the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one great commandment</span><span class="font3"> now are certain to find in him a place of complete refuge and safety: “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.” (Dent. 33:26,27) The victory is with Jehovah and his beloved Son, and those who are now faithful shall see it and rejoice.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark6"></a><a name="bookmark7"></a>KINGS, TYPICAL AND TRUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">I</span><span class="font3">N THE providence of Jehovah their God the children of Israel, the Jews, sojourned many years in the land of Egypt. For a time they were well treated. Then a wicked king arose who basely oppressed them. When matters came to their worst Jehovah God raised up his prophet Moses to act as the visible deliverer of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All this furnished a prophetic picture foreshadowing a portion of the divine purposes. Egypt under the rule of a wicked king pictures or represents the world of mankind in darkness under the rule of the unrighteous one, Satan, who is the god of this world. The Israelites in Egypt picture the people of God and those who shall ultimately come into harmony with him; while Moses was a type foreshadowing the great Messiah, who is to deliver all mankind from the bondage of sin and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moses was a prophet of God; and God spoke through Moses, using him as a mouthpiece or messenger. After the Lord had delivered the children of Israel from Egypt by the hand of Moses, he spoke through Moses, who prophesied unto Israel, saying: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deut. 18:15; Acts 3: 22) From that time forward the Israelites watched and waited for the coming of the great Prophet, Priest and King who should be like unto Moses and of whom Moses was a picture or a type. They knew that such a one must come from the house of Judah, because God had promised as much. David was a direct descendant of Judah.—Luke 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From time to time God’s prophets gave utterance to words which kept alive in the minds of the Israelites the hope that God would send them a mighty One, through whom the promise made to their forefather Abraham would be fulfilled. In time this promise was specifically limited to the house of King David, the Lord causing his prophet to write thus, in Psalm one hundred thirty-two, verses eleven and twelve: “The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">David himself was a prophet of Jehovah, and the Lord spoke through him with reference to the heir of the Abrahamic promise who should be king over Israel. The annals as set forth in First Chronicles, chapter twenty-eight, verses two to seven, read: “Then David the king stood upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: but God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood. Howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me, to make me king over all Israel: and of all my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. Moreover, I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus far the divine record definitely establishes the fact that the great heir or king of Israel, the seed through which the blessings of God would be bestowed, must come through David’s line; and that also it should come through Solomon, provided, of course, the conditions laid upon Solomon were fulfilled. In any event, it must come through David’s line, and through his son Solomon, provided Solomon met the requirements. We repeat the words for emphasis: “Moreover, I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.” And then David said: “And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. ’ ’—1 Chron. 28: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The question is, Did Solomon receive the approval of the Lord ? If so, the great Messiah must come through his line. If not, then he could not come through Solomon. This question is answered by the Scriptures, First Kings, chapter eleven, verses four and nine to thirteen, as follows: “For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord commanded. Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. Notwithstanding, in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, which I have chosen.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After Solomon’s death the nation of Israel was divided. The last three kings of Solomon’s line to rule over Israel were Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin (also called Coniah) and Zedekiah. Zedekiah became a wicked ruler and of him it is recorded: “And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [to] him.” (Ezek. 21: 25-27) This shows a complete overthrowing of the line of Solomon and definitely settles the proposition that Messiah could not be counted through the line of Solomon, but must be some other way. Seemingly God’s promise to bring the mighty Deliverer through the line of David had failed, because of Solomon’s failure. But not so. David had another son, whom the Lord used. Solomon’s line had been exalted. Now this line must be abased, and the lower line must be exalted. The obscure line of David was his son Nathan. Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a direct descendant of Nathan of the house of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jeremiah prophesied concerning the coming of Messiah, as follows: “Behold the day is coming, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper. ... In his day Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is the name that Jehovah proclaimeth him, Our Righteousness.”—Jer. 23:5,6, Young’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mary, the mother-to-be of Jesus, was approached by the angel of the Lord, who said to her: “Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man ? And the angel answered and said unto her, The holy spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” —Luke 1: 30-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then Mary, seemingly directed by the power of Jehovah, said: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation. He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.” (Luke 1:46-52) Her words draw the contrast between the once favored family of Solomon and the humbler family of Nathan, Solomon’s family being abased and Nathan’s now exalted. Thus the proof is brought forth that the Lord did raise up unto David a righteous branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The promise made to Abraham, which was subsequently repeated to others, thoroughly impressed the minds of the devout Israelites with the thought that at some future time there would be born of a woman of the Jewish people a holy child, and that in some way not understood to them this child would be the means of blessing all the families and nations of the earth. They expected God’s chosen people to become the greatest nation of earth, and looked for all other nations to flow unto it, be subservient to it and receive their blessings through it. These conclusions they based upon the words of the prophets, even though they did not fully understand the meaning of those prophecies. To them the prophet Isaiah had said: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” (Isa. 2: 2, 3) And again: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isa. 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet Zechariah said: “And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.”—Zech. 14: 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These prophecies, while relating in a measure to the birth of Jesus, had only a partial or miniature fulfilment at that time. Their far greater fulfilment is yet future, but nigh at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>LETTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DAY OF JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am deeply grateful to Jehovah our God for giving us the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I received the book on the 6th of October, at 4:00 p.m., and read the 14th chapter of Zechariah with the comments. It thrilled me through and through. That night, by His grace, I sang the glad song to a company of witnesses. Indeed they were glad to know that the interest of Jehovah’s government shall no more be defeated and overpowered by the “beast”; and that Zechariah 14: 1,2 is a fulfilled prophecy, hence it cannot apply to the future. Thus the deck is cleared for action, and victory is sure and certain for Jehovah’s witnesses. Our great Field Marshal has inspected the enemy positions and surveyed every part thereof. Now Jehovah’s militant invisible organization is approaching the mighty enemy, and very shortly the entire devilish, effete system of wickedness shall be ground to powder, and shall never be any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I finished reading the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation;</span><span class="font2"> thankful I am to our God and to you his faithful servant. The time has come for greater action. Shall we not during this year scatter two million of these “coals of fire” upon the American continent? In order to do this, every available volunteer should be mustered into the visible contingent of the Lord’s army and placed in the front ranks. Lately, many of the “people of good will” have joined the ranks, and there are many more who will be glad to do so if they get a little “lift” into the “chariot”. Every company director, sharpshooter, auxiliary, pioneer, regional director and every witness should encourage and help those around them who show interest in the kingdom message. Additionally, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all the children of Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font2">and Jonadabs should be encouraged to join in the ranks of witnesses. By the Lord’s grace this work is being carried out in the western coast states. There are several of these junior companies of Jehovah’s witnesses organized for service. It is very gratifying to see their zeal for Jehovah. Thus, if all give a “lift” the number of the witnesses will be doubled to the praise of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “day of Jehovah” is the most important part of the history of the universe; because in this “day” the name and the word of Jehovah shall be vindicated. It is more important than the restoration of the entire human family and 1000-vcar reign of Christ. The entire Bible is written for those living in this very period and who are his witnesses. Those who appreciate these facts are fired with zeal peculiar to the house of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Happy is our lot! “Let every thing that hath breath praise Jehovah. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah God continue to richly bless you and use you as a vessel unto honor, for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With fervent love, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and fellow servant, by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S. H. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Toutjian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HEARERS THRILLED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You will be glad to learn that the 16 days’ tour Brother Chapman and I made with a demonstration set resulted in 16 orders for machines being placed with us. There are now 91 machines actually in operation in the country, and we have 32 on order, and inquiries from 12 other companies. Tn addition to the above I can see prospects of at least another 30 companies with whom we are arranging demonstrations and who are likely to order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Experience shows that the outdoor work is going to be much more effective than in halls. The following is an extract from a letter received from one in Aberdeen who recently purchased a machine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Being a calm, clear night we gave the E.T. machine a trial outside this evening in a fairly quiet open space in the city with wonderfully satisfactory results for the first attempt in the open. In addition to a moving attendance it was estimated that from 20 to 25 gave an attentive hearing from beginning to end. The title of the lecture was ‘The Way of Escape’. About 30 pieces of literature were distributed, and several waited to converse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outside work is very much less expensive, because there is no advertising necessary, merely two placards: one carrying the words, “This machine is broadcasting Judge Rutherford by means of electrical transcription. Come near and hear.” The other carries the words, “This lecture may be obtained in printed form; price 2d. Get one before you leave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not necessary to wait until the summer for outdoor work. We find that in the evening, between 7: 30 and 8: 30, there are large numbers of people in the open who will stand and listen to the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is still a certain amount of opposition in some parts of the country, usually from some of the old ‘ ‘ elective elders ’ ’. A demonstration, however, thrills the brethren who hear it and the opposition is overcome. Of course, it means I have to devote most week-ends to this work; but I certainly enjoy the experience and I believe the results justify the efforts made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and servant by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">R. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Graham Burton, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S PROVISION OF GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After studying through the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> our hearts are so full of gratitude that we feel we just must express our thanks to the heavenly Father for this another expression of his loving provision of good for those who love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also desire to thank you for the gift, which we deeply appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely this book is the best yet and throws a clear light on many points heretofore obscure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After reading </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> surely there is no room for doubt as to what is the full duty of those who are in line for the kingdom, and none of Jehovah’s witnesses will hesitate to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We humbly thank Jehovah for the privilege of service daily, and in our several years of pioneer service we have had much joy and many expressions of his loving care over us; and we are indeed grateful and our desire is that we may be used in some capacity to his honor and glory forever. Daily we pray for Jehovah to bless and to continue to use you to feed the flock of God with food convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much Christian love from us both we are, by His grace, Your fellow servants,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bro. and Sr.</span><span class="font2"> H. D. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Palmer and Son Jimmie, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO ATTEND TO ALL JEHOVAH HAS TO SAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have already written to you on behalf of the Bethel family here to convey their thanks to you for the gift of the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> which you so kindly had sent for each member of the family. But I want to add a personal word so that I may express to you my great appreciation of this exposition of Zechariah, as another gift from the Lord to his people. As I read I recalled the pleasure I had seen on your face as you told of seeing present events so clearly portrayed in the prophecy, and all that this meant to Jehovah’s faithful people at this time, and I found myself entering into and sharing the experience. The pictures of Zechariah are vivid, but not being understood they could be seen only as through a dark glass. Now the Lord’s time is come, and his instrument was ready, and those things so long hidden become life and instruction to Jehovah’s people, and certainly the exposition carries the original vividness. I rejoice with his people in this gift, and because the whole word of God is being made plain, and all of it is become as a living word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As I read this exposition of the last of the vision books of the Bible to be explained and opened for reading the thought comes that surely this in itself is an indication that the end is not far off. It is an incentive to service and to pay attention to all that Jehovah has to say to us, in his own appointed way. I pray that you may continue to be blessed in your heart and mind as you constantly seek to serve the people of God, and I would say, using one of Zechariah’s phrases, so often turned in malice by the enemies, The Lord give you ever a good right eye and a good right hand that you may serve his people according to Ins will, and in this same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love in the Lord and gratitude, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours ever in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">J. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hemery, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GLAD TO TELL OTHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am writing you in regard to your speech last Sunday over the radio. I am much interested in your gospel of God and his kingdom and have grasped the truth at once. I have for several years belonged to one of the leading churches, but I have known for some time there was something wrong; for crimes have resulted from the church ruling power, and that I know wasn’t God’s will. And when my boy, twelve years old, died and I was told that God took him to be with Him, 1 could not believe that God, with all the heavenly host, would take my child and leave my home so vacant of him; for he was all my life pleasure. And lots of times I would almost turn, from God because I had many a night wet my pillow with tears just pleading with God just to show me why he took my boy and to just let me see him with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now I have seen the light and that the very Satan himself does those things just to turn people from God. This has caused me to love God more and love to do and serve Him better, for I know my boy is in the grave and will come forth in the resurrection and I shall see him in God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So glad I have read your books and heard your sermon. May God help others to see as I have and come out of the church and take a stand on the side with Jesus. I am just so glad I want to tell others, and do. I need not tell you how mad and how the Devil is stirred up in the church because they know that I have found the light and intend to walk therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May God bless us all, and thanking you for this truth, A friend of yours and a witness of God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. Bessie Gooch, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Missouri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AN INCENTIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I wish to thank you at this time for the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font2"> I know the message contained therein will be an incentive to be zealous in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This new book is one of the many blessings from the gracious hand of Jehovah, and for this favor I am indeed thankful I pray Jehovah’s blessing upon you, Brother Rutherford, and may he continue to use you for his name’s sake. With true Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother in the King’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We, a troop of Jehovah’s witnesses of Tompkins county, New York, hereby acknowledge the receipt of the latest book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> as a gift from Jehovah and we are therefore thankful to him for this gracious gift at this time, for the encouragement of all those who love Jehovah, which includes the faithful remnant, the Jonadab class, and even the “great multitude’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are also grateful to you for the part you have had in the preparation of the book and in sending it to us as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The message is encouraging because it gives cumulative evidence of the nearness of the great battle, the complete destruction of Satan’s organization, the gracious protection of the faithful remnant up to and during the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and, above all, the complete vindication of Jehovah’s great name and word, and also the share the remnant will have in the vindication of his word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah, the Father of all mercies, continue to use you until his name is completely vindicated, and afterwards, to his eternal glory. This is our prayer for all the faithful on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Jehovah’s service, J. G. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kurzen Esther</span><span class="font2"> M. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Read</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BEAUTIFUL, THRILLING, COMFORTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This morning, too ill to go out in the service work, I said, “How I wish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> would come today, while I have time to read it I ’ ’ As if in answer to prayer, m a few moments the postman was at the door with the book! And what a happy day I have spent reading it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Have just finished, and before I go to sleep I want to thank yon for your part in preparing, under the direction of Jehovah God, this wonderful gift for his people. The outside cover and illustrations are beautiful, and the message on the inside is thrilling and comforting beyond the power of words to describe. With that vision of Jehovah’s mighty army in battle formation and of the great battle itself before them, surely nothing can stop the remnant now from pressing on unto the very gates of the enemy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most encouraging thought of all to me was the assurance that Zechariah 14: 2 has already been fulfilled and that the kingdom testimony work will never again be stopped by the enemy, but will continue in spite of all opposition. That is indeed a comfort to all who love Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am looking forward to a share in placing this new message in the hands of the people, and asking the Lord Jehovah to give me strength to faithfully perform my small part in his organization until the complete vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Mighty One whom you so faithfully serve continue to bless, guide and protect you, is the prayer of</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneer camp at Chicago has received its autographed copies of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each one’s book was placed at the evening dinner table, and each was very grateful for the convenient food which Jehovah is now serving to the sons of Zion through his great Prophet and King, preparing them for his great battle, that they may stand faithful and true, a blessing to the people and for the vindication of the name of the Most High!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was the desire of the camp, at the table, that a letter of appreciation be written. Will you please, therefore, accept our gratitude for our autographed books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> giving us a greater vision of the fulfilment of divine prophecy and the purposes of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love and best wishes, and looking forward to the time when all things bear the mark “Holiness to Jehovah”, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your comrades in the King’s battle,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eear Brother-Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is with grateful hearts that we each acknowledge the receipt of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great Jehovah is wonderfully providing for us spiritual food, “meat in due season,’’ just in the Lord’s good way and time. He is surely feeding his army, strengthening and preparing us for the Lord’s battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We rejoice in having a part in singing forth his praises by our best endeavors to place this message in the hands of the people. This is the Lord’s work and we want to do it in the Lord’s way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord bless you, dear brother, and all the dear ones with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“TO HELP GET IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the beginning of a new year this is to express my gratitude for the privilege of working in the Watch Tower organization, whose lone purpose is to expose Satan’s institution of iniquity and preach God’s kingdom by which Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, among the countless gifts and favors of Jehovah I am especially thankful for the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font2"> Additionally, I shall be happy to help get it in the hands of others in the Praise Period, November 18 to 26. And this shall be another step closer to the final test of Jehovah’s supremacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With best wishes in Jehovah’s cause,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANTICIPATE FURTHER JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although, like many others, I have preferred to let the daily performance of my part in Jehovah’s service bear testimony of my appreciation of the wonderful truths he has given us, nevertheless I feel it not amiss in this case to also write you of my joy in reading </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I count it a great favor, and it makes me glad, to have a part in the publication of this message, and I anticipate further joy in sharing in its great distribution. There is so much of encouragement to the faithful remnant in this book. A more fitting message could not be conceived than that which Jehovah conveys to his sanctuary cleansed of everything that interferes with the bearing of the kingdom fruit. It has been a joy to me to watch the truth go forth from year to year in increasing volume, and in a greater number of foreign tongues. Jehovah’s many promises of protection, favor, prosperity, and fruitfulness cannot but stir the heart of everyone who loves Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THRILLED WITH JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear beloved Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Numerous times within the past eight years I have almost been tempted to write, expressing my appreciation to our King eternal, JEHOVAH, for the manner in which he is using you; but realizing as I do that you are about our King’s business and not yours, I did not so far yield to the temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But after the last series of three lectures which Jehovah through you so emphatically heralded over the nations, I broke down and just had to write, expressing my love for Jehovah, and you, for the manner in which the truth is being broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the series of those last three God-given lectures Jehovah blessed me with the privilege of getting together a few of those designated in the Scriptures as Jonadabs, who were really thrilled with joy as they sat listening to the word of Jehovah, found between the pages of that wonderful Book, the Bible, expounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My dear Brother Rutherford, inasmuch as you are so devoted to Jehovah, and inasmuch as it is apparent to all people of good will that Jehovah is using you, I shall both encourage others and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in ■ taking the battle to the gate, to the end Jehovah’s great name shall soon be vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Kingdom joy,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford’s three lectures came in just spendidly, and were wonderful and inspiring. We are surely living in wonderful times, and it is a great privilege to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The people are m worse condition than ever before. They have no money and nothing to trade. Very few people around here (California) have put up any fruit for the winter. Some who have had fruit trees right on their own lots ha\e been unable to buy sugar and cans to put it up. As Brother Rutherford said in the spring, the end of the year is finding the people in worse condition than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah’s name quickly be vindicated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Wilton and North Jay (Maine) company of Jehovah’s witnesses have come to the close of another year of witness activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is hard to describe the joy we feel on reviewing the year and noting the amount of work accomplished m our assigned territory, and we look forward to even a greater period of prosperity and blessings in the year to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We wish to express our sincere appreciation of your services, for which we continually thank Jehovah, and we extend to you our whole-hearted cooperation in whatsoever way the Lord may direct. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STAND FOR JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am only one of the millions to have the privilege of hearing you give the true meaning of the Bible over the radio. I can’t find words to express the help and comfort I have received hearing the truth told by you concerning Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus. Never in my life did we find anything to satisfy our spiritual needs before. My dear husband and I heard you when you gave the message on the Kingdom. We both took our stand for Jehovah then (right in our home). It was through one of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses (Mrs. Edwin Ballard) that we heard of the talks you gave. It was soon after that I had a stroke on my right side. While helpless in bed, my dear husband had a stroke on his left side, and died twelve days later; so you can realize what a comfort and blessing I am receiving by being able to listen to the messages given by you and the faithful witnesses in the truth here in our community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With God’s blessing on you and all the faithful witnesses wherever they are, and if it pleases Jehovah may you and the faithful ones be here for the final battle, which can’t be far off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sincerely yours (in the truth),</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anna Harrington, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ZENITH OF JEHOVAH’S PROVISION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because I believe that in the provision of the new volume, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> Jehovah’s goodness and love toward his people have been manifested in a most marked degree, I want herein to set forth my gratitude for this evidence of his favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the application of the truths and instruction contained in the two books of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> I have tried by His grace to forget self, and to live and work for the advancement of the kingdom interests. Until now I can truthfully say that I counted the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books as among my most valued possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But now that we have received this latest source of instruction and guidance I feel that it marks the very zenith of Jehovah’s provision for his own. I hope that in the use thereof I may indeed be prepared for his use, standing firmly and squarely on the Lord’s side, fighting in his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I therefore wish to hereby go on record as being truly grateful for the truths contained in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> and set forth my joy in being allowed to share with Christ, the great Vindicator, in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah’s blessings rest upon your further activities that they shall be to his honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Carey</span><span class="font2"> W. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barber, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONFIDENCE AND FAITH INCREASED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reading of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> was climaxed in your refreshing and encouraging talk today on “Why Serve Jehovah’’. Of earth’s teeming millions, where else can we turn for a knowledge of Jehovah and his expressed purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As happy children playing on a cockatrice’s den, our confidence and faith have increased. We therefore express thankfulness to Jehovah, the Society and yourself for meat in due season as expressed through the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah continue to use you for his name’s sake is my prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HEARD AND ENJOYED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greetings in the name of our Lord and King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We, the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses at Ventura, California, send our thanks and our appreciation of the three wonderful lectures from New York, and want to tell you that they all came in perfectly clear and natural, without one particle of static or interference; and as we go from door to door we hear many reports from those who heard and enjoyed them. Thanking you, and wishing you the Lord’s richest blessings, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your coworkers in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ventura company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HEARTS STIRRED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother in Zion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close of the Singhampton convention of Jehovah’s witnesses some thirty of us, mostly pioneers, were gathered in the home here waiting for the time to proceed to the Community Hall to listen to your transcription lecture, “The Way of Escape.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the radio was turned on shortly after 6: 30 p.m., our hearts were thrilled by hearing your inspiring lecture over WPG of Atlantic City, N. J. The clear, powerful presentation of Jehovah’s Word came in almost as distinctly as if you had been here in person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The message stirred our hearts to press the battle with greater zeal and determination as we more clearly realized in the message the expression of the Word of Jehovah now speaking in clarion tones as a warning to Satan’s visible organization and, above all, a testimony of praise to Jehovah of Hosts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unitedly we join in sending you this little message, giving praise to Jehovah for the beautiful gift of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> with its glorious message of instruction and encouragement so helpful and enlightening to Jehovah’s witnesses as the great battle approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in Zion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Singhampton</span><span class="font2"> (Ont.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LOOKING FORWARD TO PLACING MANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah truly provides an abundance of spiritual food as he has so graciously promised. We wish to take this opportunity to thank you for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> which you so kindly scat to us. It fills our hearts with a greater joy and zeal as we study it and see how Jehovah discloses these truths for our understanding at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are looking forward to placing many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> in the hands of the people, that they may take their stand on the side of the True God and join their hearts and voices in “praise unto Jehovah”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past two and a half years spent as pioneers have been the happiest of our lives, and we realize more fully each day that the only reason for our being here is to bear testimony concerning Jehovah’s purposes. We are so glad for the use of a transcription machine and can see how it is further helping to divide the people. Our desire is that we may further continue to have boldness in this day of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your fearlessness and zeal are an inspiration to us, and our prayer is that the Lord may provide you with the needed strength and courage to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ted and Doris Klein, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As far as Jehovah’s Word indicates to his witnesses, the due time to celebrate the Memorial in 1933 of our Lord’s death will be Sunday, April 9, after six p.m. Advance notice is here inserted that the members of Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’ in all parts of the earth may make due preparation to keep the feast in unity. The Society will be pleased to know the number participating. Company secretaries will oblige by notifying the Brooklyn office promptly after Memorial. Pioneers in this country and isolated brethren should make reports to the Brooklyn office. Those in foreign lands will report to the branch office under whose supervision they work. Brethren residing in countries not under supervision of a branch should report direct to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REMNANT’S THANKSGIVING PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">April 8 to 16, inclusive, of this year has been set aside for Jehovah’s witnesses in every province of the earth to make a united effort in a special expression of thanksgiving unto the great bountiful Jehovah. The Memorial of our Lord Jesus’ death will be observed on the evening of the second day of this special period. This being a Sunday evening, it will allow for practically all the remnant to precede their partaking of the Memorial by witnessing in the field to the praise of His name all or the half-holiday part of Saturday and all of Sunday preceding the feast. If all the faithful members of Jehovah’s remnant everywhere will strive to do this, the number of those taking an active part in giving the testimony afield as compared with those celebrating the Memorial will be greater this year than for the corresponding period last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the week immediately following the Lord's supper, all the remnant, with the Memorial blessings abounding in their hearts, will be privileged to redeem as much time as possible for publicly expressing from house to house their gratitude to Jehovah and thus share with the poor of this world the good things on which Jehovah has made his remnant to feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE CRISIS”</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TRIBULATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For then shall he great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.”—Matt. 24: 21, 22, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has repeatedly been charged with the responsibility for the tribulation that has come upon the world since 1914 and from which the people now suffer. The charge is false and defamatory to the name of Jehovah. It appears that there is confusion in the minds of some of those who are consecrated as to the tribulation or great time of trouble, and confusion as to time of the battle of the great day of God Almighty. A consideration of the scriptures relating to tribulation, past, present and future, may be had with profit, to the end that the position of the anointed may be properly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah’s name is above everything, and the vindication of his name is of paramount importance. All scripture texts are in exact harmony and all support the conclusion that Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated. It is necessary for the anointed to have an understanding of these truths at this particular time. ‘ ‘ Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that get-teth understanding.” (Prov. 3:13) “When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.” (Prov. 2:10,11) “Wisdom is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.” (Prov. 4:7) In giving consideration to the scripture texts with a view that understanding and wisdom may result it is necessary to keep in mind the paramount question at issue. Jehovah’s name must and shall be vindicated completely, and all other truths will be found to be exactly in harmony therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah’s kingdom will vindicate his name, and therefore the kingdom is the greatest of doctrines. In teaching his disciples Jesus stressed this doctrine of the kingdom. He began his preaching of and concerning the kingdom. He continued for the period of his earthly ministry to emphasize the truths relating to the kingdom. The Scriptures show that the kingdom is born in tribulation and that after its birth greater tribulation comes upon the world. The symbolic temple was built and great tribulation came upon the people afterwards. The real temple of Jehovah is erected and greater tribulation comes upon the world thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Wickedness prevailed in the world when Jesus was on the earth, and such wickedness has prevailed since. That wicked one Satan offered the world to Jesus as a gift conditionally, and such is proof that Satan was then the god or invisible ruler of the world. Other scriptures corroborate this conclusion. Later Jesus stated to his disciples in plain terms that Satan the wicked one was and is the ruler of the wicked world. (John 1(1:11) He so taught his disciples and they so understood him. Later the Apostle John wrote that “the whole world lies under the evil one”. (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> This means that the world is controlled and dominated by the wicked one Satan. Paul corroborates that statement by saying that the wicked one Satan is the god of this world, putting forth at all times his efforts to blind the people to the truth.—2 Cor. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>B</sup> Did Jehovah appoint Satan the Devil to the high position of Lord or god of the world ? He did not. Jehovah did appoint Lucifer to the exalted position of overlord of the world. Thereafter iniquity was made manifest in Lucifer. He rebelled against Jehovah and disputed the supremacy of Jehovah’s authority, caused a host of angels to follow him in wickedness, and led man into sin and death. Such wrongful act has caused men to suffer the consequences naturally flowing from the transgression of God’s law. After the rebellion of Lucifer Jehovah then gave him the names Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil. Jehovah did not take away from him the rulership of the world, and there was good reason therefor. Satan boasted of his ability to turn all mankind against Jehovah God. He arrogantly assumed to be equal to the Most High. (Isa. 14:13,14) He challenged Jehovah to put men on earth who would firmly stand against the wily and wicked influence of Satan and who would maintain their integrity toward Jehovah. Thereby was raised the issue of supremacy. It pleased Jehovah God to prove to all creation that Satan is a liar, and that he (Jehovah) is just, true and righteous, and that he is supreme and besides him there is none other, and that his Word is always true and right. (Job 2:1-7) It was necessary to give Satan an opportunity to prove his boast and challenge in order that the issue might be clearly tried out and settled, and therefore Jehovah accepted the challenge and permitted Satan to do his worst. He appointed a period of time over which Satan was permitted to exercise his free hand without interference. The time must come when the question at issue must be settled, and, when it is settled, Satan’s world must end and Jehovah’s name must be vindicated and exalted in the mind of every creature that lives. Such vindication proves Jehovah to always be right and that everything good, including life and the blessings attending thereupon, proceeds from Jehovah God and that none can have life eternal except from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•Why did Jesus emphasize the importance of Jehovah’s kingdom? Because the coming of that kingdom would mark the end of Satan’s rule and would result in the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name. Undoubtedly Jesus uttered to his disciples many words that are not recorded in the Scriptures. Without doubt he had taught them that Satan’s world would end at the time of the coming of Christ and his kingdom, which is the kingdom of Jehovah God. This is proved by the fact that the disciples propounded to Jesus this question: ‘ ‘ Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign [indication] of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” The disciples manifestly had been taught that the coming of the kingdom would be followed by the judgment of Jehovah, executed by and through Christ Jesus; and Paul afterwards so wrote. (2 Tim. 4:1) At the time the disciples propounded the question above quoted to Jesus he answered that question, and the answer is prophetic, which prophecy must have a fulfilment and which began to have its fulfilment in 1914. In the prophecy recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew the word “end” occurs in two places: first, in the third verse, and which there means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">consummation-,</span><span class="font3"> that is to say, the completion of the period of time in which Satan rules by sufferance and without interference. It therefore marks the beginning or birth of the kingdom of God under Christ, which interferes with Satan's rule. A different word in the Greek is used to translate the English word “end” at verse fourteen. There the word “end” means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the utmost limit</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">final termination,</span><span class="font3"> and means the complete passing away of Satan's world. The distinction is this: The first ‘ ‘ end ’ ’ mentioned is when the time limit granted to Satan would end; and when that time arrived certain things must come to pass before Satan’s world would completely pass away. The “end” mentioned in verse three would mark the beginning of tribulation; but the greater tribulation such as before was never known would necessarily terminate Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The whole period of time from 1914 until the complete passing away of Satan’s organization may be properly called a period of tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> Since 1914 there has been great sorrow, suffering, perplexity, and distress upon the peoples of the world. In those countries claiming to form “Christendom” the people have especially suffered. Who is responsible for this tribulation upon the world? The clergy of “Christendom” answer and inform their parishioners that it is the God of heaven that has brought this trouble upon them and that such is an expression of his anger because the people have been negligent of their duties to the church organization of ‘ ‘ Christendom”. Since the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the important matter, we may be certain that Satan does everything within his power to defame that holy name and to turn the people away from Jehovah God; and, since “Christendom” forms a part of Satan’s organization, we could not expect the true and correct answer to proceed from the clergy of “Christendom”. The answer given by the clergy is wrong and serves Satan’s purpose to turn the people against Jehovah God. Many people hearing the false answer say. “If that is the kind of God we have I don’t care to serve him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• Many among those who are consecrated to Jehovah have answered the question concerning the time of trouble in this manner, to wit: That 1914 marked the end of the world, and since that date the battle of Armageddon is in progress; and that all the trouble upon the world is but an expression of Jehovah’s wrath against the world. Such reasoning and conclusion are wrong because out of harmony with the Scriptures. It is not correct to say that Armageddon has begun and that the worst part is yet future. There is a wide distinction between the trouble that is upon the world and the battle of Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Jehovah has had no part in the trouble that is now upon the world. When he does take action in that connection, it will be so emphatic that there will be no reason to doubt that it proceeds from him and who is responsible. All will then know that Jehovah is God and that he is taking action and that Jehovah is supreme. For this reason he caused his prophet Ezekiel to time and again repeat the statement: “And they shall know that I am Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> “God is love,” meaning that he is unselfish in all of his acts. His law denounces wickedness and commands the doing of what is right. Those who love Jehovah keep his commandments. The transgression of Jehovah’s law is sin. Lucifer was the first transgressor. Man joined in that transgression and brought death upon all humankind as a result. (Rom. 5:12) All the suffering that has been upon the world is due to transgression, and particularly to the wickedness of Satan, and the suffering of the people has resulted as a natural sequence to wrongdoing. Jehovah has no pleasure in the wicked. He is angry with the wicked at all times; but he awaits his own good time to act against the wicked, and when he does act it is for the vindication of his own Word and name. (Ps. 5:4; 7: 9; Zeph. 3:8) The wicked plot against and oppress those who are diligent in their efforts to obey and serve Jehovah. It is therefore wholly inconsistent to say that the sorrow and distress, suffering and oppression, that are now upon the human race, proceed from Jehovah in the exercise of his wrath.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Because of the importance of the great question at issue, Who is supreme? it must be settled after full opportunity for Satan to prove his contention. Jehovah has permitted Satan to go on in his wicked course until due time for Jehovah to take action against him. The one responsible, therefore, for the sorrow and suffering and distress upon the world to the present time is Satan. In addition to causing the people in general to suffer, Satan has caused his agents to defame the name of Jehovah by having them tell the people that Jehovah is bringing this trouble upon mankind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">END OF WAITING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Jesus had told his disciples that his Father Jehovah had covenanted with him (Jesus) for the kingdom and that he was going away to receive the kingdom, and that he would return and receive his faithful followers unto himself. The exact day and hour of his return no man knew; no, not even the angels in heaven knew, nor the Lord himself. “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.’’ (Matt. 24:36) When Jesus reached heaven Jehovah said to him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” Jehovah alone knew the time limit. Concerning the same matter it is written: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.” (Heb. 10:12,13) That period of waiting ended in 1914. Jehovah then installed his King in office and sent him forth to rule. (Ps. 2:6-8; 110:2) Had Satan at that time voluntarily vacated his place as the god or overlord of the world, and disbanded his organization and surrendered to Christ Jesus’ righteous reign, there would have been no trouble so far as the change of administration is concerned. To have done so, however, would have been an admission on the part of Satan that he had been wrong at all times. This he would not admit. Satan resisted the authority of Christ Jesus, and the result was there was a “war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” (Rev. 12:7-9) Just how long that war lasted is not revealed, but it is certain that it resulted in the ousting of Satan from heaven, and never again can he there appear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Concerning the beginning of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ it is written: ‘ ‘ Thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” (Rev. 11:17,18) The “wrath of Jehovah” here mentioned is against the wicked Satan, who refused to vacate and to give way to Christ and who is therefore ousted for ever from heaven. Jehovah did not make the nations angry and cause them to go to war and kill each other; and this is further proved by the fact that their killing of each other is a violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant. (Gen. 9:3-5) All of the suffering and death resulting from the World War is properly chargeable to Satan. The World War was not an expression of Jehovah’s wrath against the nations and peoples of the earth. The war in heaven between Christ Jesus and Satan was an expression of Jehovah’s wrath, and the casting of Satan out of heaven as the result of that expressed wrath was the occasion for great rejoicing of all the heavenly host; as it is written: “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.” (Rev. 12:10,12) War between the nations could in no way whatsoever vindicate Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY WORLD WAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Satan knew that Jehovah had installed Christ Jesus as King and that the period of waiting was at an end and that now the great question at issue must be fully determined. Satan knew that he had failed to cause all men to curse Jehovah as he had boasted his ability to do. He knew that there were many people on earth who claimed to be followers of Christ and some who sincerely followed Him and maintained their integrity toward God. Now his purpose was to destroy the nations of the world, and particularly those called “Christendom”, rather than to see Jesus rule over them. For this reason Satan plunged the nations into the World War, and for four years the slaughtering of millions continued and other millions died from disease and pestilences attending the war. Satan incited his commercial element on earth to bring on the war for selfish reasons, that they might accomplish some gain. He overreached the political element and caused them to declare the war; and he used his sanctimonious, hypocritical clergymen of “Christendom” to give a sanctity to the war. This explains why the clergymen of warring nations, all claiming to be Christian, advocated that their people should engage in the destruction of others who called themselves Christians. Every part of the World War was devilish in the extreme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> In further proof that Satan is responsible for the tribulation upon the world beginning in 1914, and which has followed since, it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time,’’ “The inhabiters of the earth’’ means the rulers, while the “sea” represents the masses of the people whom Satan had already alienated from God, and particularly includes those who hold on to the organization called “organized Christianity’’ and which is a part of Satan’s organization. Moved by envy and unrestrained wickedness Satan would destroy all of these rather than to see them have a chance to know that Jehovah is God and give their allegiance to him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“BEGINNING OF SORROWS”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Judgment of the nations, when executed by Christ Jesus the great Judge, will bring sorrow upon the nations of the earth. This judgment, however, could not take place until after Christ Jesus is at the temple for judgment. (Ps. 11:4-6) The Scriptural proof is that Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah for judgment in 1918 and that his judgment must begin at “the house of God”, meaning the consecrated ones. The World War, which began in 1914, was the beginning of sorrows which Jesus prophesied would come at the end of the world. “All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matt. 24: 8) This is further proof that the sorrows upon the world beginning in 1914 did not proceed from Jehovah through Christ, but that Satan has brought these sorrows upon mankind in his effort to drive them away from Jehovah and to accomplish the destruction of all of those whom he cannot alienate from Jehovah. The year nineteen hundred fourteen marked the beginning of sorrows, but not the end of them, by any means. Other sorrows followed quickly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> In the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jesus all those who faithfully held to the name of Christ Jesus and Jehovah God were hated and persecuted during the World War, and many of them were killed. Many who had professed to be followers of Christ Jesus turned to the Devil and sqt snares for and betrayed to the enemy those who continued to serve Jehovah. They manifested their hatred for the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Their love for God became cold and many of them became false teachers. Jesus prophesied that these things would come following the World War; and they did come. All of these sorrows Satan brought upon God’s people because of their faithfulness and because of his endeavor to destroy them.—• Matt. 24:9-12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">END OF WAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Suddenly the World War ended, in 1918, but neither Satan nor any of his worldly organization had anything to do with causing it to cease. The wholesale slaughter of human creatures stopped with the end of the World War, but the sorrows upon the world that began in 1914 continued. Since then the Devil by and through his organization has continued to harass the people in his endeavor to turn them against Jehovah. Jehovah God exercised his power and authority to stop the World War. The prophecy by Jesus showed that Satan would plunge the nations into the war, and also shows that Jehovah would stop the war; and he did bring it to a sudden end in 1918. Why should Jehovah stop the World War? The answer is found in the words of the prophecy uttered by Jesus, to wit: “And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. ’ ’ The plain statement is that it was for the sake of Jehovah’s elect that he stopped the war, and that served to ‘shorten the days of great tribulation’. A thing can be shortened by cutting a part out of the middle as well as by cropping off one of the ends. Satan never would have stopped the World War, because his purpose was to destroy the human race; but that destruction would have brought no honor to Jehovah nor a vindication of his name. A work having to do with the vindication of Jehovah’s name must be done before the end of the great tribulation which would result in the complete destruction of Satan’s organization. Therefore, said Jesus: “For the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” It at once appears that Jehovah purposed to do something with the elect before the end of tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ELECT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Who constitute the elect, and what is the purpose of the elect? The elect company is made up of Christ Jesus and the members of his body, all of whom maintain their integrity towards Jehovah, and all of whom Satan has sought to destroy. That men have been taken out of the world and made a part of the elect and have maintained their integrity towards Jehovah disproves Satan’s contention and is to that extent a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The purpose of selecting this company of elect is that the name of Jehovah might be made known before the final battle. ‘Jehovah at first did visit the nations to take out of them a people for his name.’ (Acts 15:14) The elect must be used for Jehovah’s purposes at the time he ‘plants the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth’, at which time Jehovah makes it known that Zion is his organization. (Isa. 51:16) The scripture last cited shows that Jehovah puts his hand over the members of the elect in earth, thus showing their protection from the assaults of Satan. Concerning his elect Jehovah says: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the [nations]. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles. I am the Lord; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.” (Isa. 42:1, 6, 8) This scripture shows that Jehovah will use the members of the elect on earth for a specific purpose during the time of tribulation and that he gives this honor to none other.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The ‘shortened days of tribulation’ must take place while some of the elect are yet on the earth, for the reason that the witness work which they do by the Lord's grace must be done on earth before the final end. Therefore, in answering the question propounded to him Jesus also said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.’’ (Matt. 24:14) The good news to all lovers of righteousness is that Satan’s rule has come to an end; that the kingdom of Jehovah, which will completely vindicate his name, is here; that Christ has been placed upon the throne as the great Ruler, and that all must know that Jehovah alone is the Almighty God over the whole earth.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> It is well known that during the World War the witness work made no progress. Furthermore, not even the faithful followers of Christ Jesus then knew the real purpose of the kingdom. They did not even know the meaning of the name Jehovah, and they did not understand that the greatest thing is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It was in the year 1918 that Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah. It was after that time that he judged those in the covenant with Jehovah, and the approved ones he brought into the temple, and these were anointed by Jehovah. Then followed the enlightenment that enabled these faithful and anointed ones to see that the real purpose of the kingdom is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Why Jehovah had permitted wickedness in the earth was never understood by men on earth until after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. Then the great issue or question for determination was made known to the temple class, and they understood that Jehovah’s name means his purposes toward his creatures, and his purpose is to prove that he can put creatures on earth that will maintain their integrity toward him and that he is the Supreme One from whom all blessings flow. Jehovah anointed the temple class and gave to them a new name and made them his witnesses in the earth. (Isa. 62:1,2) In order to maintain their integrity towards Jehovah these witnesses, otherwise called “the remnant’’, must now go forth and bear testimony to the rulers of the earth and to the people that Jehovah is God, and that his kingdom is at hand, and that the kingdom is the remedy for suffering humankind. This is therefore the most important message that was ever delivered on earth, because its declaration relates to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FACTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> It was in the year 1922 that the organization of Jehovah on earth began to appreciate what privileges are enjoyed by the members thereof. The witness work, which is otherwise known as the Elisha work of the church, progressed from that time forward. The faithful remnant, by the grace of Jehovah and under the immediate leadership of Christ Jesus, have boldly gone forward with the testimony in this day of judgment, and they have been moved so to do by their unselfish devotion to Jehovah. (1 John 4:17,18) The witness work accomplished in the ten years from 1922 forward exceeds all that has ever been done before. The reason is, Because it is Jehovah’s due time. No credit therefor is due to any man. This witness work affords the anointed the opportunity to announce to the rulers and to the people the judgments of Jehovah, which judgments have heretofore been written by him; and in this manner they have the honor of participating in the judgment. (Ps. 149: 9) The anointed are process servers, and while faithfully carrying out their commission they have the absolute protection of Jehovah. The year 1914 marks the beginning of sorrows, which sorrows include the World War, and which are a part of the great tribulation but not the greatest part. Jehovah shortened that great tribulation for the elect’s sake, and the clear inference is that when the elect have finished the work assigned to them by Jehovah there will be much tribulation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMAGEDDON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Has the battle of Armageddon begun? Scriptural-ly the answer is, No. When we understand the meaning of Armageddon we can easily see that the battle has not begun. The highest part of a mountain the Scriptures designate as a hill. A mountain symbolically represents Jehovah’s organization. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ma-geddon</span><span class="font3"> means a place for the assembly of troops, while the prefix </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ar</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Har,</span><span class="font3"> used to form the word Armageddon, means mountain or hill; hence the word Armageddon means the high mountain or hill where the troops of Jehovah are assembled or gathered together. These troops assembled at Armageddon are Jehovah’s troops, including the remnant on earth. In Revelation 14:1 the Lord shows his troops to be made up of the 144,000 with Christ Jesus, and assembled on Mount Zion, that is to say, gathered together in Jehovah’s organization. Satan, knowing that soon the final battle must be fought, and the issue determined, proceeds to gather together his forces to bring them against Jehovah’s organization. Therefore it is written: “For they [.the wicked members of Satan’s organization] are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings [rulers] of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.”—Rev. 16:14,16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The battle is often called by the name of the place where it is fought, and hence the battle is said to be that of Armageddon. But let it be noted that this scripture says, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”; which clearly means that at that time is when Jehovah God, the Almighty, takes a hand in the great tribulation that comes upon the whole world, and that he does so in the execution of his judgment.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BATTLE ARRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• <sup>M</sup> Christ Jesus is the head and commander over Jehovah’s organization, and he leads the fight against the enemy. Over against him is Gog, the chief field marshal of Satan the Devil, and who leads in the conspiracy against Jehovah’s anointed, and who also leads the enemy forces at the great battle of Armageddon. The vision given in Revelation 14:1-3 discloses Jehovah’s organization under the leadership of Christ the Lamb of God. All the members of that glorious organization are seen rejoicing. They are singing together and now sing to the praise of Jehovah, because the time has come to settle the great issue of supremacy and they know that it will be determined in favor of Jehovah and to the honor and complete vindication of his name. Only those of Jehovah’s organization can know and appreciate and sing that song. For that reason the remnant on earth, as members of the organization of Jehovah, are at complete ease by reason of their faith and full confidence in Jehovah, and they are rejoicing to have some part in declaring his purposes. Over against the army of the Lord are to be seen the wicked forces of Satan under the leadership of Gog. The wicked, both the invisible and the visible to human eyes, join in a conspiracy to destroy Jehovah’s people that they may not ‘be a nation’ and serve to the praise of Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 83:2-5; 1 Pet. 2: 9,10) Satan sends forth his forces under Gog against the assembled troops of Jehovah at Armageddon. Up to this point Jehovah God by his Field Marshal Christ Jesus has taken no militant hand in the tribulation of the world. The great battle that is about to be fought is called ‘the battle of God Almighty’ because then is when he will take a hand. In the nineteenth chapter of Revelation (11-16) a vision is given of Christ Jesus ready for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, supported by his hosts of holy angels. He is shown as riding a white horse, thus symbolically saying that his cause is a righteous one and ‘in righteousness he goes forth to make war’. He is “The Faithful and True”, the Executive Officer of Jehovah, the “King of kings, and Lord of lords”. Only the members of Jehovah’s organization will follow the great leader in that war, and the part to be performed by the remnant on earth is to sing the praises of Jehovah and his kingdom. (2 Chron. 20:20-23) The great battle of the day of God Almighty has not yet begun, but it is near at hand, as all the evidence shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BATTLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” To charge Jehovah with responsibility for the ills that now afflict the world is a gross defamation of his holy name. Jehovah is right and righteous at all times, and all of his works are done in righteousness. The great battle of the day of God Almighty will be the worst tribulation that has ever afflicted the world and it will be the result of the execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment. A brief description by his prophet Jeremiah discloses that there will not be many persons left alive: on the earth. That the great battle is yet future is clearly shown, both by the Scriptures and by the facts. Although tribulation has been on the world since 1914, yet even to this day, 1933, the clergy of “Christendom”, -who call themselves the “shepherds of the flock ’ ’, are arrogant and austere and continue to feed themselves while the members of their flock are fleeced; and they continue to work hand in glove with the other oppressors of the Devil’s organization. Jehovah declares that their pastures shall be completely spoiled, and Jehovah will do that spoiling work through Christ; as it is written: ‘ ‘ And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard; for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”—Jer. 25: 33-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CUT SHORT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> While the Scriptures disclose that the battle of the great day of God Almighty will affect the entire earth, they also show that the greatest slaughter will be in the land known as “Christendom”. Satan has wickedly named a part of his organization “Christ” or “Christian”, and for the hypocrisy practiced by all involved therein there will be adequate recompense paid by the Lord. The World War furnished an opportunity to develop a crop of cruel oppressors amongst men. These oppressors became money-mad and have stopped at nothing in the way of fraud, deception, high taxes, hypocritical prohibition, and other means to satisfy their selfish greed and to work oppression upon the people. The worst of all countries under the sun, and where there is the greatest suffering, is within the realms of the seventh world power. The great depression, suffering and tribulation resulting from wrongdoing can be charged only to the Devil and his agencies. Jehovah executes all his judgments in righteousness. “The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. ” (Ps. 103: 6) Jehovah is the God of battle, and the cries of suffering humanity who cry because of their oppression have reached his ear and he will act. “His work is honorable and glorious; and his righteousness en-dureth for ever.” (Ps. 111:3) “According to thy name, 0 God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth; thy right hand is full of righteousness. Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.” (Ps. 48:10,11) In •the performance of his righteous judgment Jehovah •will destroy the enemy.—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Satan’s organization has not only oppressed the poor people of earth, but made murderous assaults upon Jehovah’s witnesses in an attempt to destroy them. Every one of the anointed would have been destroyed ere now except for the protection furnished by Jehovah. The Scriptures show that Satan’s chief objective is to destroy the kingdom class because these maintain their integrity toward Jehovah and prove Satan to be a liar. In due time Jehovah will fight for his own, and that will be a righteous warfare. ‘ ‘ Then shall the Lord go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.” (Zech. 14:3) Satan’s organization, and particularly the clergy and the principal ones of their flock, have mocked and continue to mock at Jehovah and to maltreat his witnesses. Jehovah by his prophet says: ‘‘For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. Now, therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.” (Isa. 28: 21, 22) The apostle, referring to and quoting from the above prophecy, wrote: “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.” (Rom. 9:28) Satan began the tribulation in 1914, and Jehovah stopped the wholesale slaughter in 1918 and thus shortened the days of tribulation for his own purposes. The tribulation was begun by Satan and carried on in unrighteousness; but soon Jehovah will take an active part therein, by the hand of Christ Jesus, and will “cut it short in righteousness”. That part begun by Jehovah will be the battle of the great day of God Almighty and which is sometimes called “the battle of Armageddon”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Only the restraining hand of Jehovah has held back the forces of Satan and thus prevented the destruction of the remnant. Jehovah declares that he will remove his restraint and let the forces of Satan under Gog and Jehovah’s forces under Christ join battle, and the result will be the complete destruction of Satan’s forces. That will be the worst tribulation that ever afflicted the world, and it will be the last, for the reason that the Wicked One and his organization will be done for and shall arise no more for ever.—Nah. 1:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The witness work must proceed, because Jehovah has declared that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to the nations of the world as a witness before the battle of the great day shall be fought. Be assured that Satan would immediately stop this witness work if Jehovah did not prevent him from so doing. If and when the witness work is stopped, then we may be sure that the hour has struck and that the great battle will follow quickly. Let the remnant be of good courage and never yield to the influence of the Wicked One. There is no occasion for the faithful witnesses to fear either man or devil while faithfully engaged in giving the testimony of the truth of and concerning Jehovah’s purposes which he has now revealed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> To his faithful anointed remnant the Most High has given a new name, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” To the faithful remnant his name is a strong tower of protection and complete safety, which safety, however, depends upon the faithfulness of the remnant in the performance of their part of the covenant with Jehovah. They must be his faithful witnesses and declare his truths in this day of his judgment. By so doing they run into that strong tower: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”—Prov. 18:10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> There is a class of creatures on earth who today are hearing with gladness this gospel of the kingdom. That class was foreshadowed by Jonadab. Those who go to make up that class must be teachable, and they will strive to do that which is right. They take their stand on. the side of Jehovah and his kingdom, and it is a part of the commission of the remnant to teach them and to help them to understand. These persons of good will are not desired by any part of Satan’s organization because they are not at all in sympathy with the same. It is the privilege and duty of the remnant to call the attention of the Jonadab class to such words of Jehovah as appear by his prophet, to wit: “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired: before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zeph. 2:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> While telling the Jonadab class the truth encourage them also to pass the message on to others. Even though they are not anointed of the Lord, yet it is certainly the will of God that everyone who hears the truth and loves it may have the privilege of telling i' to others. “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) Every creature now hearing the truth must take his stand either on the side of Satan or on the side of Jehovah, and therefore the people of good will should be encouraged to tell their neighbors about the kingdom. The issue of supremacy long ago raised by the rebellious and wicked one must be shortly settled. Jehovah’s King will destroy Satan’s organization, and that glorious kingdom will be for ever a vindication of Jehovah's. name.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">COMMUNITY PROPERTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">R</span><span class="font3">ECENTLY many of the brethren have inquired concerning the building of homes and establishing farms as community property for the use and benefit of those anointed of the Lord. Many of these communications proceed upon the theory that the WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY is engaged in the work of acquiring such property and forming such a community interest. That conclusion is entirely wrong. The Society has not at any time authorized anyone to speak for it in this matter, nor has the Society any legal or Scriptural authority itself to establish community properties; and it will not attempt to do so. Some of the brethren in the service have been enthusiastically advocating such a course, but such has been done on their own personal responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our commission is to preach this gospel of the kingdom, and not to look after the physical welfare of others. It is entirely Scriptural that the consecrated should make reasonable provision for themselves and their dependent ones, but this cannot be construed to mean that time, energy and money should be employed by some of the anointed to build up property for community use of others, especially where such would hinder them in their opportunities of service of bringing the message of the kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some have also very erroneously stated “that the anointed of the Lord are to acquire and come into possession of the land”, meaning the actual possession of the material things of the earth. There is no Scriptural authority to warrant any such a statement or conclusion. The inheritance of the anointed of God is the kingdom and its interests, and not houses and lands on the earth. There appears to be a great danger here of having the mind and heart set upon the acquisition of things for the comfort of the creature, and this would lead to the neglect of the performance of the commission and duties given by the Lord to his anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let this be an answer to all letters of inquiry upon this subject: The Society will not take over houses and farms to be used in behalf of the consecrated and to be held and operated as a community property. If a company of brethren desire so to do, as some have, that is their affair and responsibility; but the Society will continue, by the grace of God, to carry out its commissioned purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems that a course similar to the following would be entirely proper, to wit: Suppose one of the Lord’s people is the owner of a house or lands all of which is not required for himself or his family, but that provision could easily be made for a part of the house or property to be used and occupied by others actively engaged in the Lord’s work. If an arrangement could be made for use of a part of the property, and such arrangement is made on equitable terms and to the advantage of all concerned, and especially advantageous to the Lord’s work, that might be properly done; but such is a matter for the parties interested to determine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also if a company of God’s people, the members of which are actively engaged in the Lord’s service, see that they could jointly own and use a house or a piece of land on which to reside and to raise certain foodstuffs, and that such could be done without hindering their service and to the advantage of those who serve, and they first agree upon the terms of holding and use of such property, that might be well and good. But be sure that such will not in any manner interfere with the performance of your commission and covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It now seems next to impossible, because of depressed conditions, for anyone to sell or dispose of property to advantage, but that some property that can be used by Jehovah’s witnesses to material advantage of all concerned might be so used. If this can be done, let those interested undertake it; but no officer of the Society is wise enough to advise exactly what should be done. If a company incorporates under the laws of the land and places the property in the name of the corporation to be held and used for the benefit of the Lord’s people, such would have to be done only after careful consideration and action taken to safeguard against difficulties. It is almost certain that such a company could be managed successfully only by having one head, which one would act always unselfishly and for the best interest of the entire company. If the corporation is to be managed by a board of directors, much time will be wasted in needless discussion of what is to be done and there is always danger of controversies and of dissatisfaction arising because some of the interested parties consider that they are not being equally treated. The suggestion is made that where several take over property to be used for the benefit of the entire company, rules governing the same be first fully written out and every interested one agree to comply and fully comply with such rules that peace may be maintained and the Lord’s work not be interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The advice is further given that it seems more profitable, where it is possible, for two or more parties to acquire a house car in which they can live and travel. By this means rents and taxes are avoided and the witnesses can move around to different parts of their territory at the least possible expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The property of the Society cannot be exempt from taxes unless that property is used exclusively to carry cut the purposes for which the corporation is organized. It could be of no advantage, therefore, for the Society to undertake to organize such a community from this standpoint. A man and his family would get on better to keep to themselves rather than to mix up with others; and this can be done by the use of a house car. Where several brethren could agree upon traveling and working together, this has been done successfully and has received the Lord’s blessing. Let each little group decide for themselves what they want to do. Be assured of this, that no one in the service of the WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY is authorized to speak for it and to organize such a community; and do not rely upon any rumors or statements by others unless you see it in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or some other publication issued by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GOD’S RANSOMER FOR MAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">F</span><span class="font3">OR a long time the name of Jesus has been held before the people and emphasized. This has resulted in obscuring, partially at least, the Almighty One who is the Father of Jesus, and concerning whom Jesus said, “My Father is greater than I.” For what purpose did Jesus come to earth? Did he come of his own accord, or was he sent by another?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God has a well-defined purpose in everything he does. What then was the purpose of Jesus’ being made a man, and of his dying as a man, and being raised from death as a divine creature, and ascending into heaven with the value of his perfect human life and presenting it as a sin-offering? The purpose was that the way might be made and opened for man to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">reconciled unto God. By his arrangement God included or embraced all mankind in the sin of Adam, in order that when the basis for reconciliation was made by the blood of Jesus all who would believe and be obedient might have the benefit thereof. (Gal. 3: 22) Jehovah did not become a man and die, as the clergy would have you understand, but his Son became a man and died and was raised out of death that Adam and his offspring might be reconciled unto God. Adam and his children were and are flesh and blood. They have partaken of the human nature. Jesus must do the same thing in order to redeem mankind. Concerning this it is written: “As the children [of men] are partakers of flesh and blood, he [Jesus] also himself likewise took part of the same; ... in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God [his Father], to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.’’—Heb. 2: 14, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All children of men have been sinners and were born such and therefore enemies of God, and the shed blood of Jesus opens the way for all men to be reconciled and made the friends of God. When fully reconciled by God, then the children of men shall live. “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. ’ ’—Rom. 5: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning at Pentecost God through Christ opened the way for the exercise of faith in the shed blood of Jesus, and those who have since made a full consecration to do God’s will, based upon the faith in Jesus’ blood, God has reconciled to himself. Paul and others of his time, and men of like faith since, have availed themselves of the blessed privilege. Therefore Paul wrote: “All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. . . . For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Cor. 5: 18-21) The gracious provision that God has thus made has not been for a selfish purpose. He made this provision unselfishly for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan has used some of his agents, the clergy, to exalt the name of Jesus above that of Jehovah. He has used others of the same agents to make Jesus and Jehovah equal, and still others to deny the blood of Jesus altogether. Satan’s policy is and has been anything to turn the minds and hearts of men away from God, to becloud the truth, and to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. It is not a new trick of his. The Devil pursued the same tactics before the coming of Jesus to earth. He has been teaching the doctrine of a trinity for a long while. In the minds of men he exalted the wicked Nimrod and the wicked woman Semiramis his mother and placed them on an equality with God, thereby introducing a trinity. Then when Christianity began to grow and men were turning to Christ, Satan by his wily methods introduced a trinity into the ranks of the Christians and fastened that ungodly doctrine upon the church by the council of Nicaaa. To do so it was necessary to deny and set aside the plain statements of the Scriptures, to wit: “For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many and lords many,) but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.’’ (1 Cor. 8: 5, 6) In the face of this plain statement of the Lord’s Word, and many other scriptures corroborating the same, the clergy have gone on and still go on teaching the people the satanic doctrines of the trinity and the incarnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God is the Savior of man because he is the Author of his arrangement of salvation and all things are from him. Jesus Christ is the savior of man because he is the active agent of God used by the Father to save men and all things are done by him in the Father’s name and by the Father’s authority. Jesus and God are not one and the same in personality, but Jehovah is the Father and Christ Jesus is the Son. All things are from the Father; all things are by the Son.—Eph. 4: 6, 7; 2 Cor. 1: 3; Col. 1: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is written: “Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people.” (Ps. 3: 8) The Scriptures frequently speak of Jesus Christ as the Savior because he is the arm or instrument used to bring salvation to the people. (Isa. 12: 2; 59: 16; 63: 5) The Apostle Paul makes plain and clear the relationship of God the Father with Jesus Christ his Son, and proves that salvation is from God and that reconciliation of man to God is by and through the blood of his Son. To this end he wrote: “Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins; who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.”—Col. 1: 12-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">gift is a benefit bestowed by the giver upon another who is the receiver, bestowed without expectation of return or compensation. Jehovah God is the Giver of every good and perfect gift. “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”—Jas. 1: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the poor that need gifts. It is the poor in spirit and meek in heart and lowly of mind that gladly receive and appreciate gifts. The greater the poverty, the greater the need. Because of sin the human race was plunged into the greatest depths of poverty with no right or hope of ever enjoying the riches of life. “The destruction of the poor is their poverty.” (Prov. 10: 15) The poverty of the human race leads to certain destruction. Divine love made provision to prevent such destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus the beloved Son of God enjoyed all the riches of life in glory with his Father in heaven. He looked down upon the poverty of humankind, well knowing that the wicked rebellion of Lucifer had brought such poverty on man. He knew of God’s loving heart and of his purpose to reconcile man to himself. Jesus was willing to become poor that mankind might be made rich in life and happiness and brought into full reconciliation with God. “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”—2 Cor. 8: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Adam had been made a little lower than the angels of heaven. His sin had reduced him and all his offspring to abject poverty. Jesus left his heavenly glory and was made a man that he according to the will of his Father might become the Redeemer of poverty-stricken and sinful men. He was made perfect as a man and clothed with honor and glory as God’s Servant. The earth and all its dominion might have been enjoyed by him. He willingly gave up everything for the benefit of man. “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”— Heb. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The death of Jesus upon the tree was for the benefit of all men; and God in his due time will bring all men to an accurate knowledge of the truth, that they may have the opportunity to benefit by his death. It was the will of God that his beloved Son should become a man that he might become the Redeemer of mankind. Jesus was willing to take this step. His Father did not compel him or even require him thus to do. And now the apostle sets forth in clearness of phrase the distinction between God the Father and Jesus the Son and what the relationship to each other is in providing the ransom sacrifice. He says: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”—1 Tim. 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The love of God for his beloved Son Jesus could not be excelled. Jesus testifies to the sweet relationship between himself and his Father. When Jesus came to earth and presented himself at the Jordan, Jehovah announced that others might know: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. ’ ’ The Father and the Son loved each other. (John 3: 35; 5: 20) The Son was the dearest treasure of his Father’s heart. But without the exercise of love for mankind man could never be reconciled to God and live. The great God of the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth, freely gave his beloved Son that man might live. The apostle, after having tasted of that love divine and the heavenly gift, with no way of compensating therefor and with no way of adequately expressing appreciation thereof, exclaimed: “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.” (2 Cor. 9: 15) Thus the apostle shows that there are no words adequate to express the greatness of God’s gift in behalf of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then again Paul wrote that as it was by the offense of Adam all men were born in sin and therefore brought unto condemnation, even so by the righteousness of Christ Jesus the free gift comes unto all men, giving all an opportunity for justification unto life. (Rom. 5: 18) This great gift proceeds from God the Father, the Giver of every good and perfect gift. “The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6: 23) Love made this provision. “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3: 16) That is a complete expression of unselfishness. It is love divine. “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4: 10) Such is the divine provision for the remission of sin and for the reconciliation of man to God. “And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.” —1 John 4:16.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>LETTERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO HONOR THE NAME OF JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deas Bbothee Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord daily gives many indications that nothing can stand in the way of the forward march of the King and the progressive interests of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assembly at Knoxville, Tenn., brought us into a little different phase of the kingdom work showing the different conditions that will be met with and how the Lord will always provide a way to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Several witnesses were arrested at Rutledge, in Grainger county, about 25 miles from Knoxville, just pnor to the assembly. They were pioneers who had accepted canned goods in contribution. The people hereabouts have been supplied from time to time with provisions from the Red Cross and other so-called “charitable organizations’’. These so-called “welfare workers” induced the county officials to arrest Jehovah’s witnesses for taking out of the county supplies for the poor which they had provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneers were arrested, the foodstuffs returned to the parties giving them. Brother Wingo’s car was seized and the witnesses were threatened by the magistrate and county officials that if they were found in that part of the country again with this propaganda a posse would attend to them. So we went to Rutledge and surrounding sections last Sunday, three days after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Served notice and list of names with two county judges, the sheriff and county solicitor as we went to work. Learned that the officials had communicated with the state’s attorney and had been advised to hold us under the old song and dance of peddling without license and interfering with state charity acts, by defrauding the people out of goods supplied by them. I noted each one I talked to had a different version, and soon learned they were worried about the message and their so-called “law” was a lot of bunk. So took up the matter with the county judge who would try the case. Showed him that Jehovah’s witnesses were performing their God-given mission of preaching the gospel; that there was no commercial objective, no pecuniary profit derived by anyone associated with the work; that under the conditions it was a greater act of charity than any other entering the county, because it was for the benefit of their present as well as their future lives, and, above all, commanded of Jehovah for the vindication of his name and word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further, the fact that the people were willing and anxious to obtain the message in this manner was proof that they recognized its necessity as the most important to their welfare and to interfere would be against tho welfare in fact of the people there. In reply to the charge that the canned goods were sold and therefore taxable as merchandise, this was discredited because there was no evidence that any were sold in the county, but rather that they would be used in furtherance of the same charitable work of necessity. They released the car. Later the solicitor threatened to organize a posse to enforce the law as he said. But the sheriff would not arrest us; and the officials split on the matter: one judge and the solicitor against us, and the other judge and sheriff refusing to interfere. So nothing was done and the work progressed with results as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cars, 15; witnesses, 55; books and booklets, 378; hours, 251; obtainers, 201; testimonies, 937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This work was done in a hostile country, among clannish, ignorant people with a threatening attitude towards the witnesses. The roads were muddy and the houses widely scattered. This number was placed in a territory just worked, and among a people supported by so-called “charity”, which shows that some are looking toward the kingdom as the only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arrangements were made while here to handle all canned goods through a divisional committee, the proceeds to be turned over to the pioneers according to the amount handed in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Find that it is necessary to dig these fellows up in the south to assemble them, but after getting into the fight in this manner they are eager for the next one and seem to appreciate the issue more. I don’t see how anyone can read the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font2"> and books now and keep still anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of these divisions in the south have more colored than white. Inasmuch as the whites have such strict laws concerning the liberties of the colored in some sections, the latter are really in desperate circumstances. Practically all the colored laborers have been replaced by white men until it is a rare thing for a colored man to find a job of any kind. This is resulting in the colored’s going back to the soil; and while they will be some time getting started, they will eventually be the only ones to have the necessities of life because they are the principal ones accepting the kingdom message. They will as a rule give their last cent to get a book or booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s people now showing themselves as Judeans are working more in unity of purpose to honor the name of Jehovah by obedience to his commands than ever before. Young and old, large bands or small units, they go wherever they are called to. It is a real joy to serve with the Lord’s people in the King’s army. Am glad to convey their love and greetings to you from the witnesses in this last campaign, and join them in praying that Jehovah will bless and keep you for his name’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love, as ever,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your fellow servant to the King Eternal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anton Koerber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S NAME SHALL BE VINDICATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am in receipt of the new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font2"> which you so kindly sent to me, and I hasten to thank you for the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It contains a most marvelous report, which certainly does “buck” us up, when we realize what Jehovah has accomplished during the past year; and with prospects of the ensuing year’s being even greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was indeed thrilled as I perused the pages of this extraordinary report, and I was overwhelmed with a feeling of deep gratitude toward the Lord for the humble share which it was my sweet privilege to enjoy in the kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is easy to perceive that Jehovah’s work is going ahead with ever increasing momentum; and I am reminded of Ezekiel’s prophetic vision of the stream issuing from the temple and constantly increasing until it became a mighty river. I truly look forward with keen anticipation to the day when Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated and his truth covers the earth as a mighty river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I feel sure that this report of the year’s work will be a tremendous boost to Jehovah’s witnesses and prove a source of inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again thanking you for your favor and expressing my warm love and wishing you the very rich blessing of Jehovah, I am, United with you as his witness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">L. O. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hillyard, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“OUT OF COMMERCIAL PURSUITS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We feel constrained to take the occasion of the receipt of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font2"> you so kindly sent, to express to Jehovah through you as the leader of his earthly organization, how our hearts have gone out in praise and gratitude, not only for this bountiful gift, but for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> particularly for the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On reading that ‘the Lord is now calling his people out of commercial pursuits’ we decided to forthwith make an unconditional offer of our services to the Society, as Jehovah’s duly appointed representative on earth, in the spirit of Brother Gabler’s letter in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> for April 15, 1932, with the very gratifying result that we have already enjoyed two months in the pioneer service, and pray that we may ever continue to be fully employed in that government of the increase of which there shall be no end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord continue to richly bless you as you so loyally and faithfully seek to serve him and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arthur</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mabel Buttifant, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">•JEHOVAH IS ROUND ABOUT HIS PEOPLE’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close of another year of unnumbered blessings in the service of our King I am constrained to once again express to you my deep appreciation for the part you have so signally played in dispensing the ‘food convenient’ which all the faithful remnant have been permitted to enjoy in the columns of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and allied publications of Jehovah’s witnesses. Truly the table of the Lord fairly groans under the weight of the precious burden it now holds for those who delight in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The unfolding of Ezekiel’s prophecy in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> 1, 2, and 3 has been a constant source of inspiration and joy. I wish at this time to express my heartfelt thanks to you personally for the gift of these books as well as the 1933 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> just received. To read therein of the hardships endured by faithful pioneers in foreign lands in carrying forward the kingdom work makes one feel that in spite of some troubles with Satan’s crowd here in America we can truly say that “the lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places”. We need not expect, however, to escape the wrath of the enemy. Just as sure as that the sparks fly upward we may expect Gog to marshal all his forces for a final attack upon the headquarters of the visible organization of Jehovah here in America. Nevertheless it is written, “They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.” (Ps. 125:1,2) “For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. ’ ’—Zech. 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am also very grateful for the gift of the book called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span><span class="font2"> This unspeakable gift is to me the sweet assurance from the great Jehovah that I am one of his witnesses accepted by him in the beloved One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With ever increasing delight I am looking forward to 1933 as being that much nearer to the time when Jehovah will vindicate his great name, establish everlasting righteousness amongst men, and cause his gracious will to be done upon earth as in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Praying Jehovah’s richest blessing upon you as you lovingly labor in the interests of Zion, and with much Christian love, I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in the service of Jehovah,</span></p>

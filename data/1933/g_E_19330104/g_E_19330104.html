<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Shock Troops of the Lord in Java </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Clem A. Des ch amp</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font7">ROM time to time in the history of Java this island has changed hands. There are lingering traces of the various masters in the features, habits and religion of the Malay people. The Arab has long since lost place as far as rulership is concerned, but is almost worshiped in the religion, which is Islam (Mohamadan, in Dutch). The Spanish, French, Dutch, English, and Dutch again, each in turn “possessed” Java, but the most momentous invasion is that of the “shock troops” of the Lord’s army which have recently entered this colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every contending faction of Devil religion has been practiced on the Malay people; however, they seem to prefer Mohammedanism to accepting the western or modern one. No, there is nothing doing; they will not be ‘Christianized’. “Organized religion” has built hospitals, schools, churches and given better jobs to “Christian” Malays, but still they will not “bite”. There are one or two settlements under missionary control, but ridiculously small, considering the 62,000,000 Malays in the Dutch East Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the missionaries the Chinese are a better proposition, both financially and from appearance, but comparatively few, in view of the 2,000,000 of them in Java. These industrious people have settled down and are increasing rapidly both naturally and by immigration. These people have a good treaty with the Dutch authorities, enabling them to retain their national customs and exempting the children born in Java from rendering military service (to the Dutch).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With about 500,000 Dutch, next come German, English, French, and American, and some of every other nationality under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Java is frequently referred to as the “Garden of the East”, and although this is often exaggerated there is some justification for the claim. The country’s being volcanic, mountainous, well watered and tropical is conducive, in the extreme, to luxuriant growth. Consequently every available square inch of land is cultivated, commercially. Rice is the premier crop; then sugar, tea, and rubber, respectively. Java rice is good; therefore much of it is exported because it commands better prices overseas, and cheaper rice is imported to feed the workers who grew the good; and so we learn to love one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In passing through from town to town one has to travel high up in the mountains, where the most magnificent scenery is found. A thousand streams and cascades fringed with tropical vegetation are to be seen from the beautiful highways. These also have columns of decorative trees (the natural forests in most parts having long since disappeared). Numerous gorges are crossed on well constructed bridges, providing sights which bring tourists from every part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the passing of the forest, so passed wild life, yet in the south, the less settled districts, tiger-cats, crocodiles and monkeys are to be found. Two of Jehovah’s witnesses saw a colony of monkeys that must have numbered many hundreds. They swarmed up the trees at our approach (for we got out of the car to pay them our respects); the very trees seemed to grow monkeys. Authorities warn against this procedure. As there are many small rivers and cultivation cannot be carried on at their immediate banks, this provides space for foliage for live stock and bigger growth, which dispels any chance of the landscape’s being bare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Java was one of the last places to feel the “sorrows” that would cause “men’s hearts to fail them for fear”, etc., but now, with no outlet for sugar, tea and rubber, and myriads of unemployed (among Europeans as well as Malays) they are asking the cause and remedy. One brother placed about 3,000 books in Batavia (the capital) in five months, while battling with heat, two languages (Dutch and Malay), and social conditions so different from that of Aus-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tralia. With two brothers as reenforcements during the next five months the total was 15,000 books and booklets; that is ten months from the first attack. In harmony with Jehovah’s witnesses in the earth we believe that &quot;this is the day that the Lord has made’ to vindicate His name; therefore we are not surprised at the reception of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, this galled the clergy, and the “flocks” have been warned against this &quot;terrible literature’, but still the work has just begun and &quot;the half has not been told’. There are stirring times ahead. We are working with only three books and nine booklets, so we still have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> to place. There are four workers here and two in Singapore, all from Australia. Many are interested and there is strong indication that a study class would be appreciated if we could speak the language. Jehovah knows those that are His, and He will raise up those that will serve Him in this colony, shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manager of the Australian branch of the Society is putting out a feeler about radio, and possibly within the next two months we shall be broadcasting here the Kingdom message. This will be in English at first, as that is fairly well known. Workers use printed testimony cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The native does the work here, and does it well. He can be found as engineer, engine-driver, guard, electrician, telegrapher, etc., down to the humblest occupation. The ranks of the police are made up of Malay, and likewise the military. Indo-Europeans have equal standing with the European in all ranks, both civil and military.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The low standard of living of the Malay and Chinese point to the necessity of the speedy establishment of the kingdom of God. On the other hand, the arrogance of the masters will not be broken until Armageddon. A large number of these were doing very humble work until they came here, and now they are “ladies and gentlemen” with many servants; and it goes to their head. In the midst of these conditions the Kingdom work goes grandly on. We can all look forward to the time when our brown brothers and sisters may join in with us in singing the praises of our great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Open a Book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By an Expert Bookbinder</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TT OLD the book with its back on a smooth or covered table; let the front board down, then the other, holding the leaves in one hand while you open a few leaves at the back, then a few at the front, and so on, alternately opening back and front, gently pressing open the sections till you reach the center of the volume. Do this two or three times and you will obtain the best results. Open the volume violently or carelessly in any one place and you will likely break the back and cause a start in the leaves. Never force the back of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Caution: Do not force the flat opening of a book by holding the leaves firmly in both hands, as this will surely break the back and ruin the binding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newly bound books: These often require several months to become thoroughly seasoned. If placed in a bookease, they should be held firmly by books on either side; if on a table or stand, they should be kept under other volumes. Care should be taken not to expose them unduly to strong artificial heat.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Fine Witness for Truth in Washington</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">FFICIAL Washington was recently presented with copies of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font7"> to the extent of some 25,000 copies. Subsequently President Hoover, addressing the American Bar Association, said, “The people’s interests have been betrayed by false prophets of a millennium promised through seductive but unworkable theories of government.” It is to be hoped that there is no connection between these two items, for it would surely be too bad, for President Hoover, if he jumped to the conclusion that even Jehovah God could not provide a better government than that which America has had for the last four years.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Earliest Inhabitants of Terra Firma — The Birds</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>In Three Parts —</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part III</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ostrich, the Champion Runner</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ostrich is the largest, strongest and fleetest of the flightless birds. The males reach a height of eight feet, weigh 300 pounds, and can run up to twenty-seven miles per hour. Contrary to general belief, the ostrich never buries its head in the sand. It has an exceptionally keen eye; and when it discerns a foe at a distance it lies down, in which position at a distance it may be easily mistaken for an ant hill. Its object in lying down is to get measurably out of sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When an ostrich settles itself to run, it holds its head lower than usual and a little forward, with a deep loop in the neck. The neck vibrates sinuously; but the head remains steady, thus enabling the bird, even at top speed, to look around with unshaken glance in any direction. The wings are held loosely just free of the plunging thigh. There is no attempt to hold them extended or to derive any assistance from them as organs of flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ostrich in full flight covers twenty-five feet at a stride and can rarely be overtaken on horseback even when hunted in relays. The ostrich believes in plural marriage, family parties consisting of one male and several females. The male sometimes eats the eggs, which certainly seems to show that his morals are, to say the least, questionable. His sidewise kick has been known to kill a horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are ostrich farms in South Africa, at Phoenix, Ariz., Pasadena and Los Angeles, Calif., Jacksonville, Fla., Hot Springs, Ark., and in Oregon. At present there are 1,500 ostriches in captivity on these farms. Each bird yields about $50 worth of feathers per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New Zealand ostrich, now’ extinct, had a height of twelve feet.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Owl — The Bird of Paradise</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The owl is a bird of p<sup>i-</sup>ey, and quite a savage one at that. A pair of barn owls is considered better than a cat to rid the premises of rats and mice. They also eat rabbits, woodchucks, squirrels, chipmunks, and gophers. Not long ago the city of Conneaut, Ohio, had a plague of owls. They were not content merely to roost in the trees and salute the pedestrians with their “whoo, whoo”, but in several instances flew’ from their perches and attacked persons passing below, probably mistaking them for other animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have been known to attack hunters. At Turner, Maine, a horned owl more than three feet in length picked up a 50-pound calf and flew over a stone wall w’ith it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foot of the owl has a unique feature in the outer toe, w’hich may be directed forward, outward or completely backward at will. The eyes, ow’ing to their form, rotate but slightly in their sockets, which accounts for the owl’s habit of following with the head any object at w’hich its gaze is directed. Their prey is usually seized by one foot, then borne aw ay and torn in pieces. Undigested portions are ejected in pellets from the mouth. The voices are singular; some hoot, some whistle, and some laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Owfls are of all sizes; the pygmy owl of the Rocky mountain region is not much larger than an English sparrow’. The owd is a useful bird. It is true that he sometimes has his feathered friends on the lunch counter, but he does a much larger business w’ith rats and mice, disposing of hundreds of them every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bird of paradise, a native of New<sup>7</sup> Guinea, has the misfortune of looking too beautiful. The bird has such beautiful plumes, and they are so brilliantly colored, that the milliners of the whole w<sup>T</sup>orld are after him. Some of the varieties are the great emerald, the lesser emerald, the red, the king, the superb, and the magnificent. The beautiful plumage is confined to the adult males, nature’s method of preserving the species. The males have a peculiar way of causing waves to go over their bodies, thus showing off their plumage. One of these males, at the height of his beauty display, was observed at the New York Zoo to hang head downward and go through various contortions, all to attract the admiration of the crowds.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Parrot, the Most Intelligent Bird</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The parrot is considered the most intelligent among the birds. Of the 500-odd species the best talker is the red-tailed gray parrot of Africa; next is the yellow-headed one of Mexico. Either of these can be taught fifty or more w’ords. They are quite affectionate, but changeable and quicktempered. In Paris a parrot is alleged to have given the police the name of his master, causing the latter's arrest and conviction as a thief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A parrot can be trained into a good-disposi-tioned and companionable bird, if care is taken with its diet and language. It is susceptible to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">drafts. A parrot can inflict a very severe wound. The older birds, when captured wild, often break the fingers of their captors and sometimes almost sever them. A parrot can be trained to do the work of a watchdog and will fearlessly attack any intruder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a communal parrot; each nest is occupied by several pairs, each in its own separate compartment. There are love-bird parrots, which seem to spend most of their time loving one another. They are most unhappy apart. When one dies, its mate usually survives it only a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cockatoo is a sort of walking or flying palm-leaf fan. This particular kind of parrot is surmounted by a crest of long and pointed pink or yellow feathers, with their tips directed forward, which can be erected and expanded like a fan, or depressed, at the pleasure of the bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font7"> tells the shameful tale that at Nice, where in winter the idle from all over the world walk on the Promenade des Anglais, men sell tiny birds like parrots, beautifully colored, wonderfully tame. These birds sit on a little stick held in one's fingers, and never fly away. A woman discovered that the entire taming process consists in putting out the poor creatures’ eyes. Seeing nothing, they fear everything, and especially to lose their hold on that little stick. Would you think that any man could be so mean ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Peacock—Pelican—Pheasant</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The peacock, most beautiful and vainest of all the birds, has been a garden ornament from the days of Solomon, when, as the Scriptures tell us, “the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.” Oddly enough, though the bird comes from Ceylon, which is on the equator, it can stand very considerable cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The albatross (more properly called the pelican), with a wing expanse of twelve feet, is the largest of the web-footed birds. Sometimes flocks of fifteen or twenty of these follow ships from San Francisco for thousands of miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Study of the pelican has disclosed that it is a friend of man. It eats no fish that are useful for human food, but it does eat fish that frequently go in great schools into the nets and sometimes tangle the nets so that they have to be cut to get the fish out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pelicans can be spoiled. For years the fishermen off Santa Monica, Calif., fed their surplus fish to pelicans. The time came when fish became scarce and the feeding of the pelicans stopped. The surprising result was that the birds almost starved to death, because they did not know how to go out and fish for a living as other pelicans do. The brown pelican is the official bird of Louisiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A wealthy Florida yachtsman, some years ago, had 200 pelicans shot, so that a certain small part of the skin and feathers might be taken to make a down robe for his wife. Can you imagine anybody except some spoiled beneficiary of Big Business to be as mean as that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pheasants all came from Asia, named after the river Phasis, which discharges into the Black sea. This bird is now being bred in America in the hope that it will keep down the Japanese beetle. $11,000 was distributed among New York state school boys and girls for rearing for the state 11,076 pheasants. The state supplied the eggs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hens will raise and mother pheasants, but the pheasant, when he grows up, will kill a rooster, if the rooster starts anything. Pheasants are very valuable in keeping down insect life; the only reason they sometimes attack melons, tomatoes or berries is to slake their thirst.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The dove or pigeon is the opposite of the crow, so much so that the Lord made choice of this beautiful, innocent, gentle creature to represent the holy spirit. It was the dove that was sent forth from the ark, the dove that was acceptable as a burnt offering, the dove that was honored in the writings of David and Solomon, and the dove that rested upon the Lord at the time of His baptism. The dove is so affectionate that if placed in a sick room it will manifest such sympathy for the ailing person as to cause its own death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pigeon family numbers several hundred species. One of these, the passenger pigeon, which within a few years existed in the United States by the million, is now supposed to be nearly or quite extinct. Only a generation ago a flock of these birds would fall upon a wheat field and devastate it in a few minutes. The front birds dropped at the first sight of food, the others settling beyond them in regular order, the last birds settling farthest forward. In a few minutes the first birds would be again at the front and thus the entire flock, revolving like a cylinder, cleaned the field of all it possessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another w<sup>T</sup>ell known member of the pigeon family is the homing pigeon. In Europe, and to some extent in America, the releasing of homing pigeons at a distance is a popular sport. Of five thousand pigeons released at Washington in September, 1921, the first to arrive home at a distance of 204 miles consumed six hours on the trip, or about thirty-four miles per hour. In a short flight a homing pigeon will sometimes fly at a speed of eighty miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How the homing pigeon finds its way back to its nest is something nobody can explain. For that matter, how does any bird find its way back to its nest? A homing pigeon has been known to fly 7,200 miles, from France to Indo-China. Flights of 3,000 miles have often been made. In at least one instance the Atlantic ocean was flown in such a flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Japan, baseball reports are carried to the newspaper offices by carrier pigeons. The American Army Signal Corps has trained pigeons to fly at night, the distance being increased very slightly with each flight, but the flight made later in the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Carrier pigeons have such inhabitiveness that if their loft is moved too far they will roost on the spot where the loft used to stand. Attempts have been made to use the birds in various criminal ventures, but the police have met with considerable success in following their flights with spyglasses, so it is a dangerous game. They have been used by rum runners to communicate with their shore bases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The British take great interest in pigeon racing, sometimes racing 1,000,000 young pigeons in a month. In the year 1930 the number carried by English railways was more than 15,000,000, and at times there were as many as twenty pigeon trains running in one day. A carrier pigeon’s speed is 1,200 yards a minute in calm weather, but may rise to 2,000 yards a minute in a favorable gale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once a year, at Astoria, N. Y., thousands of pigeons are “thrown up for grabs”. This is an annual event of pigeon fanciers. Each sportsman brings a basket of birds. They are all released simultaneously, the idea being to have, the pigeons wing home and take several strangers along. Prizes go to those whose birds bring home the most strangers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The platypus is the strangest thing there is. It has the feet of a bird, the tail of a beaver, the body of a mole, the teeth of a pig, the ear of a snake, and the bill of a duck. The young are hatched from eggs, but the mother suckles her young. It is not a bird, but seems to have some features common to bird anatomy. A bird, to be a bird, must have feathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The golden plover is the prince of travelers among birds. In the spring he comes overland from South America by way of the Mississippi valley and lands at length in Nova Scotia; but when fall comes he disdains to return by the way he came and sets sail direct from Nova Scotia to the coasts of South America, a distance of 2,400 miles. How he can do this year after year without losing his way is stated by Sir Alfred Newton to be the greatest mystery that the whole animal kingdom presents. The suggestion has been made that the golden plover is sensibly affected by the lines of magnetic force and is thus a living compass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the plover family is the crocodile's dentist, the Egyptian plover. When the crocodile leaves the water he holds his mouth open, facing the breeze. At such times the plover goes into his mouth, picking the leeches and other parasites from his teeth, lips and gums. This dental operation occurs once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps you know the quail under the name of partridge or the call-name of Bob-white. This busy and cheerful little fellow is one of the early risers. In midsummer he is telling his little story as early as 2: 30 a. m. The quail is California’s state bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The quetzal of San Salvador is claimed by some to be the most magnificent bird in the world. It lives in the mountain peaks. It has a plumage of golden green and carmine colors, with long airy tail coverts which spray out two feet beyond the tail.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Reprehensible Robin Redbreast</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Lord Grey, in an address on bird life, at Edinburgh, says that the famous robin redbreast of England, though it has a pleasant face, is most quarrelsome, and that its private life is a disgrace. It boldly resents the intrusion into its private domains of even its own kind, not hesitating to resort to fratricide to gain its point. And they are jealous, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps at this point we ought to commiserate our British friends, by admitting that our own robin redbreast is not the same bird that Lord Grey exposed. Let them swallow their chagrin while we express the hope that the handsome American thrush which we call by the name robin is every way a better-behaved bird!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first point we have to make is that the American bird is a model mother. In a forest fire she will die a martyr to mother-love rather than desert her little ones. But wo quickly cover this statement with the shamed admission that this beautiful bird is killed by the thousands in various parts of the South, where it is used for food. Bobins have even been sold in the markets of Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The robin is the state bird of Michigan, Wisconsin and Virginia. It is a sociable bird. It has been known to build its nest inside a house; the owner let the window stay open night and day until the little family had left the premises. It can make a home in a watering-can or a kettle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Emporia, Kansas, a mother robin made her nest in a turntable in the Santa Fe roundhouse and pretty nearly upset the railway system, the workmen were so careful not to disturb her. She seemed distressed when the big engines came too close, and when the turntable was turned, but she had no business to rent a flat in such a location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Albino robins have been seen. One was almost 100-percent platinum shade. Robins sometimes stay around all winter. In the spring they laugh when they see the man coming with his spade or hoe or plough, for well they know the juicy, luscious earthworms that need only slight preparation to make an exquisite meal. Robins detest and abhor drouths because worms are then scarce and hard to get.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The roc, or rook, is believed to have been at least fifteen feet high, and, like the moa, probably became extinct within historic times. The shell of one of its eggs was discovered; it was a shell with a two-gallon capacity. One of the leg bones was five feet long. This is the bird that, according to his tale, made things so interesting for Sinbad the Sailor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sandpiper, or snipe, in his attitude towards the female of the species, much resembles that of the Sunday morning circus-barker taking his usual stand behind the. meat-block, just before he airs his ignorance to the congregation. As he struts and crosses in front of the female his esophagus is inflated like that of a pouter pigeon. In his own eyes he is a very important person. He summers in British America and winters in Patagonia. This bird, sometimes called the yellowlegs, is said to be the greatest air traveler among birds. Is it lese majesty to call a dominie a yellowleg?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The secretary-bird has a bunch of feathers growing on each side of its head which suggests a bunch of quill pens stuck behind a clerk’s ear. It is famous as a snake-killer, the snake being put out of business by a kick, followed, if necessary, by repeated knocks with the knobbed wings. These birds are frequently tamed and kept about South African barnyards as vermindestroyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The skylark is famous wherever English is spoken or read, for its flight song, which is begun in early spring and continued all summer. The lark ascends more nearly perpendicularly than any other bird. When it first rises from the earth its notes are feeble and interrupted; as it ascends, however, in a series of upward springs, they gradually swell to their full tone, and, long after the bird has reached a height where it is lost to the eye, it still continues to charm the ear with its melody. In winter they assemble in vast flocks, grow very fat, and, in the Mediterranean region, are taken in great numbers for the table.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Sparrows and Sparrow Stories</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The most abundant birds in the United States are the English sparrows. These were brought into the United States in 1851 and liberated in the parks of Boston and New York. Being a stranger, and therefore without any natural enemies, the sparrow throve so remarkably as to threaten America’s own song birds with destruction. Today there are millions of these little fellows in all parts of the United States; but the crows and blackbirds have discovered that the sparrows make good eating, and are now giving them undivided attention, with the result that it looks bad for the English sparrow. This little bird averages to eat about a hundred insects a day. There are about 500 varieties of sparrows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The song sparrow stays with us the year round, but in the northern states they are more plentiful in summer than in winter. They sing in every month in the year, but most persistently and sweetly during the breeding season. Given a little sunshine they start their joyous outbursts even in midwinter. The sparrow is of special interest to the child of God, on account of Jesus’ statement that ‘not a sparrow falls to the ground without your heavenly Father’s knowledge’. If God finds pleasure in the praise from a little sparrow, He may also find it in the praise from a little man or woman. And all humans are little in His sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tree sparrows are common around New York city all winter long. The sparrow is quite a late riser, beginning his song in midsummer at about 5: 00 a. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good joke is published on the Soviet government. A public official whose name is the same as the. Russian name for “sparrow” sent a formal message to a city telling them to “keep ready”. He signed it with his name. The serial number of the message was 13,530. The city to which it was sent misunderstood the message to mean “Keep ready 13,530 sparrows”. In desperation they tried to collect the required number and actually gathered in 2,000 of the little birds before the true meaning of the dispatch was made clear. The town was merely to “keep ready” to do whatever might be necessary to win the Soviet program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font7"> contains the following story about a sparrow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whilst at my work in a railway signal box at Burnley, Lanes., I happened to have occasion to go out of the box, and I saw a hedge-sparrow apparently feeding another one. I paused for a few moments, and the sparrow flew away, and then I saw that the remaining one had been injured, presumably by a goods train which had recently passed. You can imagine my amazement, when, after a minute or so, the sparrow which had previously flown away returned, bringing more food to the injured one. After a few minutes the injured bird tried to hop away, and eventually managed, after much resting (and with the other, whieh I took to be its mate, constantly hopping attendance upon it) to get to the hedge side. I came to the conclusion that it was in much more capable, if not more sympathetic, hands than mine, and proceeded towards the water well, marveling at the lesson which these little sparrows could teach to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of our contributors, Susan E. Clark, gives us a somewhat similar story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One day the family noticed a young chipping sparrow following a female English sparrow about; and fearing that the older bird might turn and fight the little one, they watched them. To their surprise they saw the young bird hop on the back of the other, which made no objection; and soon the English sparrow began picking up the crumbs about the door and feeding the little chippie. This was amazing enough, but later it was observed that the whole brood of chippies was about, which the parents were feeding, while the English sparrow was helping them. One was found to be a cripple, and was watched over by the house people for several days to save it from prowling cats. The English sparrow gave special attention to the little invalid; and finally the parents left him entirely to the care of the nursemaid, and devoted themselves to feeding their healthy offspring. The faithful nurse watched and fed her charge for several days, until one night a drenching rain proved too much for the frail birdling on the ground, and in the morning it was found dead. The family buried it, and soon the English sparrow came to the spot with food in her mouth for her charge. Not finding him, she continued to come at intervals for several days, and waited around mournfully with food in her bill. But the parents of the little one never appeared to look for him.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Starlings and Storks</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The starling is a bad actor. He thinks nothing of plucking wool from the back of a sheep to line his nest, and we know where he cleaned fifty goldfish out of a pool as slick as any cashier ever took a bank’s assets for a plunge in the market, or as any bank president ever cleaned the small stockholders out of a big enterprise. Starlings visit the nests of bluebirds and purple martins, suck the eggs, destroy the young birds, and give the parents much anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The starling was first introduced into America in 1890. In Europe it is much appreciated on account of its activity in keeping down insect pests. When given a crust of bread, the starling first soaks it in water, to make it more palatable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Washington and Baltimore have both tried to get rid of their starlings with shotguns, smokepots, Roman candles, and even the fire department's hose streams, all to no avail. When they get into a neighborhood they are there to stay. Sometimes a flock of starlings will raid a cherry tree and pick every cherry in a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Storks, as is well known, are wont to build their nests on roofs or in chimneys; though they have been known to build them on the ground. A wag in Grimsby, England, recently perched a stuffed stork on his roof, and for many days had the neighbors trying in vain to coax it to come down for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Nile valley has a variety of stork, called the shoebill, which is unable to turn its head without turning the eyeball in such a way that only the white is visible. The effect is so surprising that it has been known to scare children into tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This particular bird will catch in his beak, one after another, a half dozen or more biscuits, as they are thrown to him; but he is not fond of biscuits, and after his great lower beak is full he solemnly gives the benefactor a reproachful look, turns all the contents out on the ground, shows the white of his eyes, and stalks off with an air of hauteur that is enough to break up a congregation.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Swallows and Swallow Stories</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">There are about one hundred species of swallows. The North American tree swallow is one of the first to move northward in the spring, and is frequently forced to retreat before a belated snowstorm or a cold snap. This has led to the saying, “One swallow does not make a summer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last year winter came unusually early in central Europe, and millions of swallows were caught away from their usual winter homes in the lower Balkans. The Viennese took a real interest in their plight and sent to Venice several airplane loads, 25,000 birds to a plane; and 35,000 more were sent in specially heated railroad cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The birds liked the ride, but they did not like the looks of Venice, so they straightway flew over the Adriatic sea, back to their old winter nesting grounds in the Balkans. A case is on record where a swallow flew from Antwerp to Compiegne, a distance of 140 miles, in 68 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the metropolitan papers contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“An army of invading chimney swallows ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 in number will follow their leader down or up a chimney,” Dr. F. M. Chatman said yesterday. “This proves that the bird story from Kingston, N. Y., was not a fish story.” . . . Frank V. Rice, a shipbuilder, and his wife were the victims of the surprise party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘When we returned home Tuesday evening the room was filled with birds. The walls were black with the soot from their wings. Some were perched asleep on the mantel; others had crawled into cream pitchers; still others were flying around and around the room. We opened the windows and the doors; we tried to chase them back up the chimney and down to the cellar; but all in vain. They believed that they had found a nesting place for the summer, I guess; for several already had found some thread and string and were weaving these into nests in corners of the ceilings. Finding we could not chase them out, we started action. Chairs, brooms, sticks and anything else we could get were used in saving what was left of the inside of our home.’ Last night Mr. Rice was still counting the dead, which filled two cider barrels and two coal shovels. He estimates that there are 5,000 dead and 5,000 escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While we are about it we give another bird story, this one from the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paris.—Long voyages of migrating birds are well known, yet it is not alwaj's easy to obtain tangible evidence of their journeys, and bird-lovers will be interested in the story from Alsace about a swallow’s water travels and sojourn. Last fall a resident of Ost-heim captured a swallow nestling in a gable and released it, with the following message on parchment attached: “During the summer of 1921 I lived with --, at Ostheim. He would be glad to learn where I passed the winter when I return.” The bird now returns to its Alsatian home, bearing the following inscription: “Have been staying with a shoemaker, Joseph Bady, on the island of Martinique, who salutes my present host.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Tanager—Tegwane—Thrasher—Thrush</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">What a beautiful thing is the scarlet tanager or firebird! The mature male is a rich scarlet, except his wings and tail, which are pure black. The song is loud, vigorous and merry, and is heard later ip summer than that of most other birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tegwane, of South Africa, is really not a stork, but is sometimes called the hammerhead stork. Of only about the size of a raven, it builds a nest twelve feet in circumference, horizontally and vertically, and so strong that a man may walk back and forth across it without doing damage. On account of its apparently mean and glittering eye, the Zulus regard the tegwanes as bewitched and will not go near their nests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thrasher, one of the most pleasing of American migratory birds, is well known to every country boy and has a highly varied song, fairly rivaling in performance that of the mocking-bird itself. The brown thrasher is the state bird of Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thrush, as we have admitted, is the prop</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">er </span><span class="font7">name of the American robin. It is also the true name of the English robin redbreast, the English blackbird, the nightingale and the hedge sparrow. The wood thrush is the official bird of the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nightingale is considered the most beautiful singer of all birds. As its name implies, its song comes in the night. It is not the song of a ladybird, as most of the poets have it, but is the song of joy of the male at having finished his migratory flight from far-off southern climes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nightingale does its singing from April 15 to June 15, and is at it night and day, entertaining his mate during the period of incubation. Birds trapped after the mating season are said to languish and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Begbie, a temperamental British nightingale, periodically sings to the whole world over the British broadcasting and allied networks. Begbie will not sing until his ambition has been stirred by a couple of phonograph records, and then nothing will drive him from his place at the microphone.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Stormcock—Titmouse—Turkey</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The stormcock is a British name for a large thrush, also called the mistle-thrush, on account of its unusual fondness for mistletoe berries. The stormcock has </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> habit we all might well follow: its song is as fine and as happy on rainy days as on sunny ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No bird is more universally loved and enjoyed than the black-capped titmouse known everywhere as the chickadee or pewee. The last names are due to the notes so often heard in their calls. This bird is very active. It can be easily attracted to any spot where food is provided, and, if unmolested by cats or otherwise, will become very familiar. The chickadee, as the downEast Yankee loves to call it, is the state bird of Maine. It is one of the late risers, not beginning its midsummer song until about 5: 00 a. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The American wild turkey is one of the cleverest of all the birds. Her nest is hidden with supreme cunning. When she leaves it for a time she covers her eggs with leaves, slips noiselessly out, and then crosses and recrosses her tracks again and again until no animal could possibly follow the scent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When an enemy is in sight the mother hen pretends that she is crippled. Frantically she keeps up a fluttering and flopping by which she is seemingly barely able to keep out of the clutches of the pursuer. The whole object is to lead the enemy away from the vicinity of the nest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The youngsters, from the moment they are born, know enough to keep still the moment the mother hen gives them a warning “put”. They may be clucking and gobbling and having all kinds of fun, but the moment the mother utters that sound they are silent as death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brush turkey of Australia amasses a heap of several tons of leaves, apparently for the heat produced, for leaves heat like a hotbed.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Vireo—Vulture—Warbler</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">There are twelve species of vireos in North America. The red-eyed vireo, which is best known, is strictly a bird of the woods and is noted for its quarrelsomeness, activity, and the energy with which on the hottest days it continues to search for its food and to attend strictly to the business of singing its little song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nature is good to the vulture. He is endowed with such acute powers of smell and vision that he can locate the dinner table forty miles away. He does valuable work in keeping the fields and woods clear of carrion. In the southern states the vulture goes by the name of buzzard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Havana the vultures have been so plentiful and annoying about the new capitol that the gilded dome is charged with electricity, and now every time a vulture (buzzard) bumps into it there is a puff of smoke, a Hash of blue flame, and no more vulture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The East Indian warbler, commonly called the tailor bird, is just what its common name implies. It sews a dead leaf to a living one or so joins two neighboring leaves together as to form a kind of hanging pouch the lower part of which contains the nest. Actual cotton threads or twisted vegetable fibers are used as thread, the bill serving for a needle in puncturing holes in the leaves and drawing the thread through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A certain writer, describing the warbler family, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The warblers have we always with us, all in their own good time; they come out of the South, pass on, return and are away again; their appearance and withdrawal scarcely less than a mystery; many stay with us all summer long, and some brave the winters in our midst. Some of these slight creatures, guided by unerring instinct, travel true to the meridian in the hours of darkness, slipping past “like a thief in the night”, stopping at daybreak from their lofty flights to rest and recruit for the next stage of the journey. Others pass more leisurely from tree to tree, in a ceaseless tide of migration, gleaning as they go; the hardier males, in full song and plumage, lead the way for the weaker females and yearlings. With tireless industry do the warblers befriend the human race; their unconscious zeal plays due part in the nice adjustment of nature’s forces, helping to bring about that balance of vegetable and insect life without which agriculture would be in vain. They visit the orchard when the apple and pear, the peach, plum and cherry are in bloom, seeming to revel carelessly amid the sweet-scented and deliciously tinted blossoms, but never faltering in their good work. They peer into the crevices of the bark, scrutinize each leaf, and explore the very heart of the buds, to detect, drag forth and destroy these tiny creatures, singly insignificant, collectively a scourge, which prey upon the hopes of the fruit-grower, and which, if undisturbed, would bring his care to naught. Some warblers flit incessantly in the terminal foliage of the tallest trees; others hug close to the scored trunks and gnarled boughs of the forest kings; some peep from the thicket, the coppice, the impenetrable mantle of shrubbery that decks tiny water courses, playing hide-and-seek with all comers; others, more humble still, descend to the ground, where they glide with pretty mincing steps and affected turning of the head this way and that, their delicate flesh-tinted feet just stirring the layer of withered leaves with which a past season carpeted the ground. We seek warblers everywhere in their season; we shall find them a continual surprise.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Water-Ouzel—Weaver Bird—Whidah</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The water-ouzel, or dipper, has the power of seeking its food, which consists almost exclusively of snails and water insects, not only by diving, but by partly swimming and partly walking with fluttering wings along the bottom in search of its prey. It can remain under the water tw’o or three minutes at a time if it so desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will propel itself by its wings upstream against a current so strong a man could not keep his footing in it. It occasionally makes its nest back of a waterfall. In winter these little gray birds swim or fly under thin ice from one air hole to another. When these little fellows come to the surface the water rolls from their feathers and they are perfectly dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weaver birds of Africa construct an umbrella-like roof, under which from 800 to 1,000 nests have been found. In all such cases fibers are the materials employed. In some cases the birds of a pair take positions on opposite sides of the structure and the fibers are passed through and through from one to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nests are generally suspended at the extremities of branches, and over water, so as to afford security against snakes and monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One type of weaver bird even inserts thorns in the nest as a protection against marauders. A Philippine species builds flask-shaped nests of fine roots suspended mouth downward by long ropes of similar construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Polygamy is customary with some birds. One of these natural polygamists is the beautiful long-tailed whidah of Africa. He gathers to himself about six females, which he watches over with as much care as does any sultan over his harem. The grackle is also a polygamist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The whippoorwill tells his name many times in the course of a night, always with the accent on the last syllable, but is usually quiet by midnight. He never moves about in the daytime, and therefore his appearance is quite unknown by many who are very familiar with his song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The woodcock has his busiest hours just after sunset and just before dawn, his principal food being earthworms. He often visits city lawns on moonlit nights. The female woodcock is very solicitous about her young, sometimes bearing them one at a time from a supposed danger to a place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Woodpeckers, of which there are 300 species, are found everywhere except in Australia and Madagascar. A grub is located in a dry tree, either by listening or by inspecting. Straightway the woodpecker drills a hole until the grub is uncovered. A long sticky tongue finishes the job. The woodpecker is considered so valuable as a timber preserver that stringent laws for its protection are common in the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The woodpecker is a most industrious bird. One morning, a Sunday morning at that, one of them evidently heard a worm under the slate roof, and the way he hammered on that roof, at 4: 30 a.m., trying to break his way through the slate, was almost enough to wake the dead. And even though stoned, he came back again and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The woodpecker makes his own nest by a hole which he drills first horizontally and then vertically downward. There are about 350 species of woodpeckers. One of these the Negroes call by the opprobrious name of “shirt-tail bird”. That is all just because, innocently, he has white upper tail covers and a white rump. Why blame a bird for something he can’t help?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of those industrious woodpeckers can do something no darky could do, no matter how good his intentions. He will eat three thousand ants at one sitting, and enjoy them! The woodpecker is distinguished by forty different names. In Alabama it is called the flicker, and is the state bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In August, 1932, in the sovereign state of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Anna Chess, a mother who had a large family to provide for, went hunting and shot a woodpecker. It happens to be a bird protected by the laws of the state, and some great (?) and good (?) and wise (?) judge sent her to prison for twenty days. No doubt the woodpecker that was killed was a valuable citizen ; he was certainly as much so as such a judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And last, but not least, we have the busy little wren. A lover of bird life, writing of interesting happenings in the neighborhood, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another neighbor acts like a thief in his own woodshed, for a pair of wrens have nested in the woodstack. He creeps in stealthily, moves slowly, is careful where he takes his wood, docs not enter frequently, and makes most of the moments when the bird is away. When necessity demands that he use his own shed, he is scolded vociferously by a midget in feathers whom he could hide in his fist. The situation is absurd but honorable, for the host will not upset a guest who is reposing in his trust!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">And when they had finished, about three weeks later, the figures and reports were taken to the printer, and printed on glossy and expensive paper; and the reports were distributed throughout the cities with an “appeal” for help, aid and assistance, partly to feed the multitude but in great measure to pay the salaries of the Welfare Workers and the Secretaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So a great drive was organized in the cities, while the multitude waited and the loaves and fishes grew stale and unpalatable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The German Crisis </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Lowell Bito (New Jersey)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE seething controversy that today storms the governmental structure of Germany may be largely attributed to the rapid growth and increasing influence of ardent Fascism. This militant faction, strengthened by the inability of the government to alleviate unemployment hardships, has won tremendous acclaim through promises of ameliorating the lot of the discontented citizenry. So successful has been this form of propaganda that, at the general elections in September, 1930, Fascist representation in the Reichstag increased from 12 to 107. This made the Nazis (Fascists) the second most powerful faction in German politics. The Nazis then found themselves in a position to influence political maneuvers, and they lost no opportunity in encouraging legislation that fostered their principles; while they fervently and vehemently decried all measures of importance only to other factions. Such deliberate methods in time created a marked spirit of antagonism; and the friction between the factions rapidly developed into bitter and envenomed controversy. It is beneath the furore of this controversy that today the government is staggering in a manner so precarious.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>A Republic in the Making</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">A full comprehension of the German crisis necessitates the consideration of these facts: Germany is adjusting herself to a government that is peculiar to the oligarchic system under which she has labored for centuries. During this period of transition there is, of course, no such soundness of policies and stability of administration as is found in a government firmly entrenched. There is, of necessity, a constant alteration for improvement and still further betterment: a meticulous attempt to substitute one reform for another, and thus to replace each glaring deficiency by measures supposedly more adequate. During the birth of our government, as in the infancy of all democracies, there was pursued a similar trend towards improvement. In our country, for example, the drastic alterations to which the “Articles of Confederation” were subjected finally led to the establishment of our present constitution. But under the “Articles” was there a scintilla of that efficiency vhich now characterizes our government? Did the members of the Union then possess that cohesiveness which now binds us together in endearing fraternity? Germany, like our colonies, is undergoing changes that are invariably necessary to a government still in its infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ever since the inception of the new German constitution, these governmental vicissitudes caused a skeptic minority of the German people to stigmatize their government as irresolute and vacillating. This group interpreted governmental adjustments as the precarious shiftings of a staggering power. They viewed their government with much the same anticipation as they would a versatile funambulist. However, their views, founded on so strained a hypothesis, lacked conviction, and hence its scope embraced only a small group of adherents.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>The Inception of Hitlerism</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">But of late the distress caused by the current economic maladjustment not only has incited in this sect a more dangerous degree of agitation, but also has provided them with better material for propaganda. They are now enabled to impregnate their arguments with more substantial reasoning and less metaphysical speculation. The result is that their ranks are increasing; and contumacy is beginning to show its brazen front. Thus there is being created a national psychosis of malignant unrest: a psychosis composed of so desperate a feeling of insecurity, so small a vestige of fidelity, that the slightest provocation is liable to cause an ebullition of anarchism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cognizant of these circumstances, the German administration sagaciously contrives to maintain its commanding position. Unfortunately, it is now not only confronted by problems that are inherent to a new government, but also harassed by demonstrations of dissatisfaction. These demonstrations are the display of an irate emotion, a spontaneous reaction to a governmental maneuver. During the early ages of civilization the slowness in communication made impossible the present gravity of these displays: time elapsed before the citizens learned of governmental activities; more time elapsed before their feelings were registered at the executive seats; and during the intervening period riled emotions had subsided without any result. But today each parliamentary decree is simultaneously read in every German community. Almost instantaneously there follows a mobilization of forces disheartened by it. On the other hand, the advocates, with equal rapidity, ally themselves in forceful opposition. The result is an</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">embittered conflict between the elements of satisfaction and discontent, the very clash between Euphrosyne and Niobe. Consequently the government’s attention is diverted from urgent routine work and is given to devise compensatory measures.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Old Obsequiousness All Gone</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">In the interim the German imbroglio rapidly multiplies in its intricacies and complexities. There is no longer even a vestige of that obsequiousness which the Germans endured under the Hohenzollerns. Unrestrained emotions, pernicious plotting, and overt acts of violence are creating a turbulence of grave potentialities. A turbulence in which policies of conservatism and liberality, labor and aristocracy, religion and persecution, are all equally embroiled. One group praises what the other condemns; a third sect encourages certain measures, while its adversaries croak only reprehension. All factions offer variant plans for supplying the nation’s exigencies, but each is lost in the riotous clamor for attention. Such chaotic conditions have, to varying degrees, characterized all governments while passing through a similar period of metamorphosis. Macaulay, in his “Essay on Milton”, depicts the English Restoration which, with the exception of a few episodic details, is quite similar to the German crisis. Indeed, it is in just this sort of raging caldron in which were molded the foundations of the most puissant democracies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Against this panorama of national turbulence there looms forth the menacing promontory of the National Socialist movement. It seems incredulous that a political party so insignificant in its origin, so heterodox in its policies, can, in the space of a few years, develop into proportions that overshadow the structure of a national government. Yet Adolf Hitler and his national socialist party (the Nazis) have accomplished this rare feat. It is such a momentous accomplishment that the factors contributing to its success are of exceptional interest.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>A Racket, Pure and Simple</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Hitlerism is neither a renovation of a forgotten principle nor is it a newly formulated panacea. It is simply a doctrine of government in which there is an incongruous fusion of radical ideas and unrestrained fancies: ideas that wholly separate themselves from reality; and fancies that infer a degree of mental derangement. Quite naturally, therefore, Hitlerism does not find its greatest appeal in the merit of its basic principles. This fact becomes the more obvious when it is remembered that Hitler vehemently exhorted his doctrine during a period of some years, and yet he received, not enthusiasm, but yawning apathy. In fact, it is highly probable that were he to have preached </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum</span><span class="font7"> he would never have excited interest, so heterodox were his ideas, and so puerile his fancies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sensible of the fruitlessness of his gospel, Hitler, a few years ago, resolved to fuse Iris emasculate principles with theories more virile and potent. Hence there followed a revision in which essentials of Hitlerism were crudely amalgamated with orthodox methods of government. Such a combination of radicalism and orthodoxy, however, could not fail to breed in Hitlerism the most preposterous contradictions: contradictions in which Hitler extols the virtues of radical autocracy, while attempting to admire the blessings of popular democracy. He, in one sentence, speaks of establishing an autocratic Germany of economic self-sufficiency; and, in another sentence, he speaks of promoting international benevolence through reciprocal trade. Hitler’s latest speeches abound in these glaring contradictions. In the main, these miserable errors are caused by a militation between Hitler’s idealistic philosophy and his attempt to interpret those ideals in the form of stark realism. Obviously this sort of dissertation has little persuasive value; but it serves to arouse curiosity and thereby stimulate some public interest.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Base and Ignoble Appeals</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">In fact, throughout the embryonic and mature stages of Hitlerism, there is clearly discernible this fervid attempt at attracting interest, and gaining sympathy. So governed are the Hitlerites by this passion that their every expression rings with self-eulogy and supplication for support. Ruled by such despotic zeal, the Nazis naturally employ, in their oratory, arguments that tend more to stir the emotions rather than to demonstrate the inadequacy of the present administration. For instance, the Nazis delight in depicting the government as a tottering man struggling beneath unjustifiable pecuniary impositions ; a man blanching with fear when asked to repudiate those impositions. They repeatedly portray the Germans as a prostrate people unable even to feed their families; and then, in phrases approaching scurrility, they paint the government as a stealthy thief robbing the purses of the citizens in order to amass sums with which to pay “tribute” in the form of reparations. The Nazis lack no art in fashioning similar imageries to illustrate such supposedly governmental iniquities as the stagnation in German industry, the government's agreement to “unilateral” treaties, and even the tariffs immuring German trade; all these imageries are deftly designed to incite a deadly antipathy against the administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been evinced by local elections, held since the revision of Hitler’s doctrine, that hordes of humanity are swayed by these miserable reasonings and emotional portraitures. These polling triumphs quickly raised Hitlerism from obscurity to a plane of petty significance. It is highly probable that normally this would have been the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ne plus ultra</span><span class="font7"> of national socialism. However, at this juncture Germany was seized in the octoputal grasp of the world-wide economic panic. The pernicious effect of this catastrophe, although dangerously undermining German institutions, nevertheless greatly served to facilitate the further development of National Socialism. Since this factor contributed so greatly toward the growth of Hitlerism, a few paragraphs relevant to this phase of the subject are here unquestionably fitting.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Vast Additions to Lower Classes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to the recent economic depression social Germany was experiencing a mutation of such proportions that its magnitude is unique in the annals of the country’s history. Intensive and prodigous mechanization projects were steadily eliminating the need for manual labor. Hence the proletariat, in order to maintain sustenance, were compelled to adopt vocations hitherto performed by higher social classes. On the other hand, the large corporation mergers and powerful banking combines were making competition too strenuous for independent merchants and financiers. Consequently, the private business organizations were gradually disintegrating, and their members, now minus their lucrative income, were being absorbed by the lower social strata. Thus there was being effected a steady integration of social classes into the bourgeois group; and the more scrupulosity exercised in perfecting mechanical efficiency and furthering monopolistic enterprises, the more intense this integration became.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What conditions the culmination of such a social fusion will create is as yet a conjectural conclusion. However, it may be seen from the following that the present status of this social trend is of sufficient moment to influence the formation of national party policies. It may be seen further that the aptitude of Hitlerism for the demands of the new social formation is, in a large measure, the attraction of the national socialist movement.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>The A hite-Collar Slaves</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">At the time that Germany first felt the undulation of the current financial upheaval her rapidly increasing white-collar employees’ class numbered approximately 3,400,000 members; of this group about one-third were women. The salaries of these office employees are somewhat lower than those received by menial and laboring classes. The male office employees are paid on an average $63.57 per month, while females receive on an average only $37.38 a month. Added to this, a youth is paid only one-half to one-third the amount received by his elder. This practice naturally encourages firms to discharge employees as soon as they have reached the age of forty-five and to fill the vacancies with employees of the younger generation. It becomes at once obvious that such low salaries, such discrepancy between the value of male and female work, such inane and insipient treatment of old employees could not fail to arouse a feeling of animosity in the breasts of the disparaged Germans. This smoldering animosity naturally grew in proportion to the increasing duress of the economic panic. Thus with the further aggravation of conditions by the maladjustments of recent years the accursed plight of this class of people became unbearable. Hence they looked for succor, not to the established organizations which have so sadly failed them, but to the budding Nazi movement and its numerous promises of immediate and effective relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitlerism, therefore, finds its most spontaneous advocacy among this class of people. Three millions of this group are so destitute that they can scarcely maintain the living standards of the lowly proletariat. However, under the increasing strain of economic conditions, there is less grumbling about social degradation, and proportionately more brooding over future earning power deprivation. These people have little interest in those theories that propose to alleviate their burden by adjustments through international trade agreements. Their speech, their thoughts, their very acts are all expressive of the undivided interest with which they view their domestic problem and its possible future. Not being fully sensible of the exotic influences upon their industries, they naturally lay all the blame for the present hardships upon the shoulders of their administrators, and christen them in the light of perfidious malefactors. Thus the jeopardy of their social prestige, the sharp diminution in their earning power, the miserable prospects of future betterment, all they charge to the impotency of the existing regime. Hence it is not astonishing that it is this class of people who should reverence most profoundly the man, Hitler, who offers to change the order of things; and that this class should most fervidly extol the virtues of a doctrine bulging with plans of remedial significance.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The University Students</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Another ardent group among the proponents of Hitlerism is the faction composed of German university students. These young men are, of course, least inured to the buffets of present economic trends. No amount of inculcating, however, could have so vividly impressed them ■with life’s struggles as the chaotic panorama that now meets their gaze from every side. They watch with saddening eyes the dolorous faces of some thirty thousand recent graduates who are desperately still seeking employment. They realize with a shudder that in a year or two the ranks of these graduates will be swelled by another hundred thousand. These are indeed crushing prospects for a set of young men who are fired with zeal and ambition to arrive at honors in this world of opportunity. Their spirits are more deeply veiled in melancholy when they behold their beloved parents vainly striving against dastardly fate, exerting all efforts till exhaustion, and then swooning in the fetid effluvium of despair. No filial heart could witness the unfolding of this tragic drama and yet not sw<sup>T</sup>ell in bitter protest. It cannot be expected that these students would support the government under which such abominable conditions are existing. They, however, are sufficiently familiar with governments to realize the absurdity of the policies advocated by the extreme Left. The other parties in Germany, in the eyes of these students, too closely resemble the present government. Hence they espouse the cause of the national socialist movement, the movement that promises them the best future.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>The “Sturmabteilungen”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">It is these university students who form the nucleus of Hitler’s military organization the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Stiirmabteiluiigeii.</span><span class="font7"> Among the Hitlerites, there is much importance attached to this military unit. It is intended not oidy to protect the members of the national socialist movement, but also to serve as an adequate substitute for the former national army. A considerable portion of the sturmabteilungen is made up of young men from the labor classes. Although a large percentage of German laborers are under the influence of the Left, nevertheless these young men have associated themselves with Hitler because they believe Socialism is more likely to gain control of the government than the Left faction. The sturmabteilungen, however, is not as important and powerful as Nazi zealots would have it believed. It is not sufficiently well organized or equipped to be of any immediate danger to the government. But the psychological effect that this military unit creates among the Nazis is undeniably of great value to Hitlerism. It leads the Nazis to overestimate the strength and importance of their party; it lends them an air of superiority; it instills into them a sense of security. But aside from this psychological effect, the sturmabteilungen is of no more worry to German authorities than organized gunmen are to Chicago police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably there is nothing so indicative of primitive consciousness in the entire Nazi program as the anti-Jewish sentiment it so passionately advocates. Racial prejudices and religious creeds for hundreds of centuries have formed the fulcrum on which was balanced the destiny of nations. Civilization has been extremely slow in realizing the insipience of such prejudices. The Occident, of course, has made the greatest progress in minimizing the importance of religious and racial differences. However, when such contemptible sentiment arises in a modern country like Germany, it serves as the very mockery of human progress.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Appeals to Anti-Semitism</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The Nazis assert that if the five hundred thousand Jews were evicted from Germany there would immediately be thousands of vacancies in German business enterprises that could promptly be filled by &quot;genuine German</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">n* GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">stock”. They argue that commanding positions in German industry are held by Jews whose motives are grounded wholly in selfish interests. But if these positions, they continue, were occupied by “true-blooded Germans as the Nazis”, then not only would the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sons</span><span class="font7"> of the fatherland be employed, but the country would be the better under the unselfish cooperation received from patriotic industries. Probably it is too strained an assumption for Hitlerites to consider themselves better German citizens and patriots than Jews. It should be borne in mind that Hitler himself is of Austrian extraction. But if this arrogant assumption is not granted, then Hitler himself is at a loss to justify his anti-Jewish feeling. Indeed, enmities aroused by racial and religious differences are always founded on grounds the most yielding and scornworthy. And especially should such sentiment be spurned with ineffable contempt when it parades itself under the alias of patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although this reprehensible sentiment is shared in varying degrees by all of the adherents of the Nazi program—soldiers, shopkeepers, widows, students, lawyers, petty financiers, tradesmen, etc.—it is not prompted by an inveterate antipathy, but is rather the excrescence of desperate competition. The strongest tenet of the Nazi program is its plan for providing employment; and thus they believe that by evicting the Jews from the country they would ease the competition between Germans for employment. Therefore, if Negroes were as numerous and progressive in Germany as the Jews, then the Hitlerites would direct their shafts against the negroid race. Hence it becomes at once obvious that competition for employment has reached such a tension in Germany that men bitterly envy each other because they have the fortune of being employed; and the people of the nation have lost all decorum and decency in the impassioned struggle for the survival of the fittest. Every class, every human, feverishly clamors for anything that promises work.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>The Clamor for Jobs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The furore of this clamor for relief was undoubtedly most manifested during the elections last summer. Gregarious humanity flocked to the polls, and registered their votes for the party that promised them the most effective relief. The Nazis gained enough votes to seat 229 of their members in the Reichstag. Then followed a period of gruesome conflict between the factions. Riots were common occurrences; embittered brawls were daily events. Men snarled at men; factions lampooned factions; and lethal weapons glittered in their concealment beneath coats and jackets. Monstrous oaths rent the air as though from Dante’s hell ascending; and children screaming fled in blanching horror. Maimed, wounded, and dead were daily found upon the streets. Women, children, and mendicants feared to venture forth from their homes. And yet this was only a struggle between factions ; but it more closely resembled hostile war. It was a struggle in which supremacy was attained by annihilating the opposition; so despicable a conflict in a country under democratic rule. It is these dire scenes and militant acts that at times shroud Democracy in deepest sorrow.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Influence of Von Hindenburg</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">Amidst this turmoil and confusion there stands preeminent a silent hero who is deserving of more attention than is generally given him. Without a doubt this man, Paul von Hindenburg, has been the very tie that bound together the disintegrating structure of the German government. He has accomplished this task without any ostentation, without any flamboyant legislation, without any mark of super-intellectual leadership, but with a subtleness that justly stamps his feat with the highest merit. On his shoulders has rested a responsibility that would have humbled a lesser man. About him were strewn such technical problems that it required the utmost shrewdness and diplomacy to properly adjudicate them. Hindenburg faced the task and proved equal to the occasion. He performed his herculean work with such reticence that the brilliancy of his acts was pilloried before the world, while he remained hidden in obscurity. This is the mark of true devotion; this, the stamp of noblest patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hindenburg is least happy when he is garbed in the robe of a politician. He sadly lacks that quality of barter and compromise which is the essential characteristic of an accomplished politician. He has definite ideas and a dogged determination to materialize them. In every one of his dictates, in every one of his acts, there is a precision that betrays his militaristic makeup. His subtleness is the shrewdness of a soldier; his diplomacy, the tactful yielding of a maneuvering general.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Germany Under Military Rule</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">During the elections last summer he viewed the conflict between the Nazis and Communists with an apathy typical of a meditative general. He realized that were he to interpose his authority it would only aggravate the situation. But when street brawls became too common, he felt that the time had come when definite action need be taken. Immediately he clapped on Germany a form of tyrannical militarism. In spite of the drasticity of such a decree, it would have been impossible to devise another measure equally effective under the circumstances. However, the resulting expressions of dissatisfaction by the masses bore such a menacing tone that the government seemed seriously endangered. The administration contrived to appease the situation by offering to Hitler the post of chancellor. Since this position was offered to him on condition that his policies be in conformity to the principles of the German constitution, and that he would refrain from militaristic coercion, Hitler flatly refused the office. However, although Hindenburg abandoned his tyrannical rule, he had succeeded in vividly impressing the radicals with the tremendous power at the command of the German government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hindenburg, like Ulysses S. Grant, is not as distinguished in the role of a president as he was in the uniform of a general. Hindenburg, however, has made a better president than Grant, because the demands of modern Germany are such as to require the guidance of a general rather than a politician. Hindenburg has had the assistance of a fervid love that the people bear for him. He is still the idol, the patriot, the hope of the German masses. Because of this intense emotion of idolatrous veneration, the people have tolerated much of his dictatorial and militaristic methods. It is these very methods, however, that were not only of value to Germany, but also of indispensable merit in the crowning glory of his presidential career. If the country were in need of a subtle diplomat, a litigious politician, then Hindenburg would have failed as miserably as Grant. But the country needed a firm ruler, a man of decided policies and action, an elevating inspiration, and these qualities of Hindenburg have caused him to be held in esteem by many of the German people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The annals of social history are replete with epic movements that resemble the turmoil of the German crisis. Invariably the aggravation of these movements is in proportion to the slowness of relief extended. It is therefore a logical conclusion that the power of radicalism in Germany will decrease in proportion to the increase in employment and prosperity. However, if the return of normal times is delayed until radicalism is firmly rooted, then the country will undergo an evolution of titanic proportions.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Poisoning of Our Fruit Supply</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">JPEW people are aware of the extent to which our fruit and vegetable supply is being poisoned through the use of arsenic insecticides. Arsenic is an extremely poisonous substance which is harmful even in small amounts. In the year 1900 alone, six thousand people were poisoned by beer containing small amounts of arsenic. Last year, in California, six people were poisoned by eating mustard greens sprayed with lead arsenate. Last August a four-year-old girl died from eating sprayed fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the present time most of our fruit supply, especially that produced in the western states, and a large part of our vegetable supply are sprayed with lead arsenate to protect them against the coddling moth and other insect pests. Many fruits are sprayed several times during</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Walter Siegmeister (N. Y.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the season, and the arsenic is absorbed both by the leaves and by the fruit. Washing fruits does not remove the arsenic they contain, not only on their surface, but also beneath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1925 England threatened discontinuation of fruit imports from America, due to the contamination of the fruit with arsenic. This led the federal Food and Drug Administration in 1927 to declare that while apples intended for export should not bear a residue of more than 1/100 of a grain of arsenic trioxide per pound, apples intended for domestic consumption would be permitted to carry two and one-half times the “safe” limit of arsenic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Investigations revealed the existence of arsenic in the following foods: peas, carrots, apples, mushrooms, pears, rice, beef, veal, mackerel, eggs, potatoes, cauliflower, spinach, white beans, cabbage, lettuce, dried peas, dried fruits. Cocoa and baking powder also contain arsenic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arsenic is not the only poisonous substance present in fruits and vegetables through the use of insecticides. Lead, the other constituent of lead-arsenic spray, is certainly far more dangerous, for lead is a cumulative poison which is stored within the body and becomes dangerous to the point of disaster when enough of the metal has collected. Lendrich, testing American apples, found that of forty-five samples examined not a single one was free from arsenic or lead, and there was sixty times as much lead as arsenic on some of the apples. Tests of four apples and pears purchased in New York city in August, 1932, showed appreciable amounts of lead on each apple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If spray residue on fruits and vegetables were the only source of lead, it would not be so bad, but the body is constantly storing this cumulative poison from many sources, the most important of which is from water which has flowed through lead pipes. Speaking of the injurious effects of minute quantities of lead and arsenic, Dr. A. J. Carlson, of the Hull Physiological Laboratory of the University of Chicago, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking as a physiologist interested in public health, I should say that the question is not how much of the poison may be ingested without producing acute or obvious chronic symptoms, but how completely can man be safeguarded against even traces of the poison. There is no question in my mind that even in less than the so-called “toxic doses” lead and arsenic have deleterious effects on cell protoplasm, effects that are expressed in lowered resistance to disease, lessened efficiency, and shortened life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Myers and Throne found arsenic present in the bodies of all subjects tested, though they admit that it serves no physiological purpose. Arsenic was found to have an irritating effect on the involuntary nervous system, producing peripheral neuritis, nervous twitching of the eyes, and various skin diseases. After a careful search, they found arsenic to be present in potatoes, canned tomatoes, peaches, pears, grapes, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, cabbage and apples. Cocoa, candy, baking powder, some baby foods, beer, wine, and cider were also found to contain arsenic. Myers and Throne claim that arsenic is toxic even in infinitesimal amounts, and that many neurological conditions may be traced to this cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yerin claims that all the marketed orchard fruits in the United States have been poisoned by sprays containing arsenic. Those known to be commonly poisoned are apples, plums, peaches, pears and grapes. Among the vegetables, the following are known to be poisoned: cabbage, lettuce, celery, endive, spinach, cucumbers, Irish potatoes, beets, and asparagus. The following foods have been found to be contaminated with arsenate of lead: peaches, pears, plums, all berries, tomatoes, Irish potatoes, asparagus, cabbage, lettuce, beets, celery, cucumbers, spinach, and radishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many states the laws are such as to make it almost compulsory upon the fruit-grower and market gardener to spray whatever he would market; and in several states it is rigidly compulsory for the grower of tree fruits to spray all his products. Orchards are sprayed four or five times a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yerin claims that the arsenic spray applied to the plant or tree is readily absorbed by the leaves, circulating throughout all parts of the plant, and is carried to the fruits where the plant juices concentrate. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In medieval times the watering of garden vegetables ■with poison solutions was secretly and effectively practiced for the removal of undesirable opponents and enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Present clinical experience covering years and thousands of cases shows that the plants do absorb sufficient of the spray poisons to bring about definite sicknesses in a wholesale degree, and oftentimes with a speedy death, and frequently followed with complications that bring about death at a later time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Graphic</span><span class="font7"> for November 12, 1914, records a case of nine men poisoned by cider made from apples containing arsenic. Concerning this case, Dr. Yerin remarks :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arsenate of lead found in the cider is found in varying degrees in all eiders of all fruits that have been sprayed with the arsenate of lead solution, which is the common solution used in spraying fruit trees. The writer has known many deaths caused directly by eating sprayed fruits, as well as by drinking the juices of sprayed fruits. In some instances, the eating of but one or two sprayed apples has caused deaths within an hour or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All sprays are in very definite degrees absorbed by all fruits upon which they are applied. Paris green dusted on potato tops at night is found in very definite amounts in the potatoes in the morning, as proved by extensive experiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sprays always impair health and very frequently produce definite disease; and deaths attributed to acute indigestion are always due to eating of sprayed fruits or vegetables; besides, many deaths that are attributed to ptomaine poisoning and other causes are due to this reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apples are most heavily sprayed and contain the largest amount of arsenic. The writer would therefore caution all readers against eating apples purchased in the market. The same applies to pears, peaches, plums, and apricots. Much safer than all these foods are muskmelons, which are much less likely to be sprayed. Muskmelons supply the body with the purest water, and have a decidedly alkaline reaction, far exceeding that of any fruits or berries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Orange, N. J. “I am a man of 40 years and have been a member of the Catholic faith all of that time. About three months ago I had a radio installed in my home. Previous to that time I could not afford to have a radio, as I am a very poor man. One day I happened to tune in and get the Watchtow</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup>er. One of Jehovah’s witnesses was giving a Bible lecture. I had never heard the Word of God explained like that before. ‘Surely,’ I said to myself, ‘those people know the Word of God.’ Since that time I have heard your voice, and never before have I heard God’s Word of truth explained as you have explained it. Any intelligent person who hears your voice cannot help but be convinced. Surely you are not asking anyone to believe in any man-made doctrines. If the Bible is God’s holy Word, why should people be asked to believe anything different, such as the immortality of the soul, the trinity, hell torment and purgatory ? Those certainly are contrary to Scripture. I don’t profess to be a Bible scholar, and have very little education, but I do know the truth when I hear it. I have read your book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font7"> In that you have shown up the hypocrisy of the clergy. They indeed have become worldly. Jehovah’s witnesses are the only people in the world today who are telling the truth to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am continually being persecuted by my wife for listening in on your Watchtower programs. I have four children. All are going to the parochial high school. They are familiar with the precepts of the church, but are absolutely ignorant of the Bible. They, too, are opposed to me. It is a fact that anybody who dares tell the truth to the people will be persecuted on the earth. With the aid of your books I intend to learn more about God’s Word, and if it is ever possible I would be glad to meet you in person. I never knew a man who is so fearless as you are in telling the truth to the people.” J. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indianapolis, Ind. ‘'Reading your address in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> of July 2G, 1932, I want to say I wish we had more people in the United States that have the nerve to speak the truth to the American government and public like yourself. Will you kindly send me a copy of the next issue? I am one of the many millions that are out of employment. I am only twenty-five years old, broken down from many operations, and, having no home, had to come to a county home as a last resort.” W. H. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kingston, B. W. I. “I have realized the seriousness of the times and have taken my stand on Jehovah's side. I attend the lectures and pass the messages I have received to hungry souls, who are very glad to hear the glad tidings of ‘deliverance’. The ministers here fail to tell their flocks the Scriptural meaning of the distress of nations. All they say is, “Trust the Lord for better times,” and oppress the people more for money. Several of them try to oppose their flocks’ reading your books. Since Mr. George Young gave a very interesting lecture, they are annoyed. His message stung several of them, also the principal of their flock. ‘Big Business’ say that things will continue as they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Jehovah’s witnesses here are very earnest. They go about the city distributing books, as well as the country parts, sometimes meeting with great opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Several persons who do not profess anything ask my opinion as to what is the meaning of these ‘hard times’. I told them that Satan is the cause, for he uses ‘big business’ to stow away the money and use labor-saving machinery, oppress the poor and rob them of their wages. The ministers here are now appealing to their starving flock to give God (themselves) the widow’s mite. They have, never spoken one word about Paul’s laboring with his own hands to feed the poor saints. I think this is a wonderful subject for you to tackle, whenever Jehovah wills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I had been a ‘prisoner in the prison house’ for a long time, but the Lord in His own mysterious way started to open my eyes, by pointing out the hypocritical actions and oppressions of these hirelings. I remained at home for three years, and since last year I received the glad tidings joyfully. I am present every Friday night to hear the wonderful news, also Sunday, unless prevented by sickness or rain. Am satisfied and am now rejoicing and experiencing His goodness to me every day. Every night I ask Him to protect His organization against Satan, also to reveal more light to you and protect you, His mouthpiece.

When the radio station announces the Watchtower, they will shut it off or switch to some other station. The real Christian has no chance whatever. The society clubs consisting of the ladies belonging to the social register and blue book 400 usually gather at meetings, and anything that does not suit them, or anyone who crosses their path or who is not to their liking—well, it is too bad for that one. I will give you a sample. During the prosperity Mrs. J----S----called a meeting to</span></p>

We also enjoy your radio lectures and tell our friends of them. I have been able to talk WBBR to my mother, who is in the Odd Fellows Home at Trenton, and she informs me that your station is now tuned in every Sunday morning, and she writes me a number of the old folks have become greatly interested and have asked her about the books. I have just mailed a dozen or more pamphlets and will see that they get an entire set of books after the pamphlets wake them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am a veteran of the Spanish and World wars and am well cured of war. I know better now. After my return from France I had little belief in anything, but about ten years ago I heard WBBR on the radio and learned the truth. Prior to then I looked with fear on the prediction of the end of the world. Since listening to your message I know what the promise of the Kingdom means and would now welcome the end of the world, which means the end of Satan’s rule. Our best wishes to you and your coworkers, that you may have the health and strength to continue to bring comfort and enlightenment to the people who are now suffering from Satan’s dying efforts to lead them away from God.” R.

<h5><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>The Creator’s Kingdom</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH created all things for the praise of His own name. (Rev. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font7">:11) Had all creatures remained in harmony with Jehovah the purpose of His works would be realized even now by praises to the Most High. Due to the fact of rebellion, however, the enemy has turned many creatures away from the Great Benefactor and the objective of creation has been hid and grossly misunderstood. A time must come when all who desire shall know and love Jehovah, His name will be vindicated, and the objective of creation will be realized by the unending songs of praise to the Creator. That objective could not be realized under the unrighteous reign of the enemy, but awaits the vindication of Jehovah’s name in His righteous kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Knowing the purpose of His works and the intimate relationship of the kingdom of God to the accomplishment of that purpose, Jehovah caused the psalmist to write, “All thy works shall praise thee, 0 Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion en-dureth throughout all generations.” (Ps. 145: 10-13) Millions of creatures have not known Jehovah heretofore, and it has been impossible for such creatures to worship the true God. When the creature comes to a realization of who Jehovah is and of his relationship to his Benefactor, at that time, and not before, does he become wise. No creature can be wise who does not know the purpose of existence; he is wise, indeed, who bends all his powers to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can now understand why there is so much discontent, disappointment and sorrow in the world today; and, furthermore, we can now understand why even some who vowed to do God’s will, becoming restless, have been turned aside by the wily enemy and forsake the path of righteousness. These conditions are caused either by not realizing the purpose of creation or because, having once learned the real work to be done, many have been led by the enemy into side lanes and the doing of those things which are foreign to the real work that God would have His people do at this time. There may be many apparently worthwhile enterprises in the world, a show of public benefit may allure many to take a slight departure from the right course, or the temporary gratification of personal pleasures may draw one into the paths of temptation. One cannot pursue a course pleasing to the Lord and chase the butterflies of one’s own fancy. The question is not what may temporarily please creatures or even benefit them. The real issue is, What is pleasing to the Lord? He who understands and appreciates the Creator’s purpose must also persist in following a course consistent therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If one realizes the purpose of all creation to be to praise and magnify the great God and persists in following a course consistent therewith he cannot go wrong. It is what Jehovah wishes done, not what we wish done, that is the all-important thing. Right in this connection, while considering the proper thing to be done we cannot let even our good intentions be a safe guide in a course of action. Undoubtedly the path to destruction is paved with the glittering stones of good intentions. You will recall how Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark when the oxen stumbled. Uzza’s intentions so far as he wished to keep the ark on the cart may have been good, but he was disobeying the command of the Lord because he was not a Levite. (1 Chron. 13:9,10; 15:2) On account of his disobedience the Lord smote him to death. The Kingdom work now demands that we obey the Lord’s commandments, and only as we do His bidding are we doing those things that are praiseworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course there is much suffering in the world today because the people do not realize the purpose of all creation. The temporary spurt of selfish activity only leads to disappointment when one discovers that his hopes are blasted and his efforts have been in vain. The real reason for so much discontent is that man is not doing what he was created to do. It is only as one knows and zealously does the things for which he was designed that he can be truly happy. What would the Lord have me do? How can I praise and honor my Maker? These are questions of paramount importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this time there are numerous creatures on earth, also there are creatures invisible to man, who do not appreciate that Jehovah is the true God; and without faith and love for the great Creator it is impossible either to please Him or to serve Him. We see, therefore, the great necessity for the vindication of the name of Je-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">hovah at the outset of the Kingdom arrangement. Those who love the Lord earnestly desire that His name be vindicated. The vindication of Jehovah’s name comes at a time of judgment and the manifestation of the great power of the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Almi</span><span class="font7">ghty. When the people of earth appreciate the righteous judgments of the Lord and learn of His goodness, then they will praise Him forever. In Isaiah 26:8,9 we read, “Yea, in the way of thy judgments, 0 Lord, have we waited for thee; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the desire of our soul is to thy name, </span><span class="font7">and to the remembrance of thee. With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are numerous creatures visible and invisible who have rebelled against the Most High. These enemies must be put to death in the early part of the Kingdom in order that God’s judgments may be accomplished and in order that the obedient creatures may be untrammeled in their service and praise of Jehovah. This is accomplished at a time when the name of Jehovah is brought to the fore. Speaking words of encouragement and assurance the witnesses of Jehovah now on earth say, “Through thee will we push down our enemies; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.” (Ps. 44: 5-8) Those who have already felt and appreciated the power of God in their behalf realize the weakness of the arm of flesh. They praise God for His goodness, and this they do because it is right that they should worship the Lord and do Him homage in grateful recognition of His many favors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Creator is the source of all power, and He will abundantly manifest that power in the coming battle of Armageddon in vindication of His name. His wondrous works at that time will cause all to tremble, and those who love Him will give Him thanks because of His judgments and the righteous execution thereof. “Unto thee, 0 God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved.” (Ps. 75:1,3) The righteous do not fear the coming wrath against the Devil’s organization, but rather pray for it. When the present unrighteous organization is dissolved, a new and righteous kingdom will have sway in all the earth; the creatures will come to a recognition of things as they should be, and the hearts and hands of all the obedient will rejoice in the works of their Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this time of trouble and uncertainty that is upon all nations of the earth the best thing for all to do is to call upon the name of the Lord; He is the only one on whom to rely and His organization will provide protection in this time of distress. As Jehovah manifests His power and His strange act in vindication of His name, the people of the nations who will survive (and there are millions of people of good will toward Jehovah’s witnesses) will worship before the true God and glorify His name. This, indeed, will be a time of great joy among all creatures and will make the heart of Jehovah glad. There will be a new start in earth’s affairs, a new day in which the human family will prosper in those things which are pleasing to the Lord, and the creatures will realize the purpose of existence in the everlasting praises of Jehovah. “Give ear, 0 Lord, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. Among the gods there is none like unto thee, 0 Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, 0 Lord; and shall glorify thy name. For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.”—Ps. 86: 6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having noted a number of scriptures which clearly point out to us that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated at the very outset of the new kingdom, we can now appreciate the fact that v.hen the people know the Most High they will praise Him by their words and actions. When He has put down the enemy by His field marshal, Christ Jesus, and manifested His indisputable supremacy the people will praise His greatness and majesty. So impressive will be the display of His power and His mighty acts in the battle at Armageddon that these will never be forgotten; one generation (Jehovah’s witnesses) shall tell the memories of Jehovah’s acts to the other generation (God’s faithful prophets and witnesses before Christ) who will be awakened from the graves. “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wmndrous works. And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.” (Ps. 145:3-7) The people will be overjoyed in the goodness and blessing of Jehovah, because He will treat them in a manner different from what they have experienced under the hand of the cruel enemy. The joy which the people will have in their hearts will overflow in the praises which will ever be upon their lips to the honor of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After man was created and placed in the garden of Eden the law was given to him, the keeping of which would have insured the favor of God and His blessing. On account of disobedience the people have been overreached by the enemy and have been blinded as to what the law of God really is. In the Kingdom this veil which has been cast over all nations will be lifted, and the people will see what is pleasing to God and will do it. As the inhabitants sing the praises of God they will receive of His blessing and be given bouyant health, and the righteous Nation will secure their welfare. “That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. 0 let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.”—Ps. 67: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has made the earth for man, and has so constructed the materials thereof to supply the common necessities to sustain human life. During the reign of evil selfish men have obtained possession of the mines and oil wells of the earth, and have exploited the people with these necessities of life. The wheat, corn and other grains have passed from producer to consumer by way of restrictive tariffs to support the idle rich. The giant skyscrapers in our large cities and which represent the hard-earned dollars of millions of people have really been reared upon the backs of the laboring masses. The ponderous systems of governments with their many useless bureaus, politicians and grafters have really been playing into the hands of the privileged few and have resulted in the undoing of the people. Things will be reversed under the kingdom of the Creator. At that time the earth will yield abundantly and the hand of the profiteer will be thwarted. The people will rejoice in the provisions of their Benefactor. “Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.”—Ps. 67: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the purpose of Jehovah that all His works should praise Him. This includes both animate and inanimate works of His creation. Undoubtedly, as one appreciates the wonders of creation with the wisdom which the Lord has provided, such objects will arouse admiration for the Creator. Heretofore, under the reign of Satan, the people have been kept from an understanding of the truth, and also from appreciating the fact that the wonderful things by w’hich we are surrounded in the heavens and here on earth are products of the Almighty. It has been the object of Satan to keep the people away from Jehovah. However, inasmuch as it is the purpose of God that all His works shall reflect glory and praise to Him, a time must come w hen the people will know Jehovah and appreciate His works. There is, therefore, much to learn in the wonders of creation which science falsely so called either has not disclosed or has so tw’isted as to give an entirely wrong impression of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Studying the glory of the heavens and the laws by which the stars and planets are held together and interlace with such precision and regularity, one is astounded at the wisdom and power of the Creator. One will also marvel at how the Creator uses the mighty deep, fire, hail, snow<sup>7</sup>, vapor and the stormy wind to fulfil] His word. These things Jehovah makes and uses in a manner strange and perplexing to man. They do not function by mere chance, but will certainly be used marvelously to accomplish the w’ill of their Maker and Governor. The whole of the 148th Psalm gives us a picture of the marvels of creation doing honor to Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of Jehovah: for he commanded, and they were created. He hath also established them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is excellent ; his glory is above the earth and heaven. He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>Cows Are the Happiest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N A SERMON on happiness the Rev. Dr. William J. Thompson of Drew University, dedicating the new Methodist Episcopal Metropolitan Temple, at Seventh avenue and Thirteenth street, said that it is a duty to be happy and that unhappiness is a sin. And then he raised the question whether the 23,000,000 cows in the United States are not more happy than the same number of people; and we have to say that they are, because they don’t have to listen to a lot of sermons on happiness that are pure bunk from beginning to end. Happiness in the Lord does not mean happiness in the flesh; often it means the very reverse. But why try to tell that to the cows?</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font7">OT only docs San Francisco plan to span the Golden Gate by a bridge which will be one of the wonders of the world, but it is also expecting to run a bridge straight across San Francisco Bay to Oakland. These enterprises, which will cost some $75,000,000, will employ approximately 6,000 men for three and a half years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society prints a calendar each year for the benefit of those people interested in the distribution of the message of the Kingdom. Throughout the year, certain periods of time are set aside for special witness purposes. These periods are known as “Testimony Periods” and are designated on the Society’s calendar. Many people of good will, keenly interested in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, like to engage in distributing some books and booklets during these periods, knowing that they have a part in this most wonderful work of vindicating God’s name in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The calendar contains a very interesting picture which speaks volumes and is a study in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These calendars are now ready for shipment and can be had at 25c each; if five or more copies are mailed to one address, they can be had at 20c each. A limited supply is made each year, as it is a calendar specially designed for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font7"> is of the greatest value to one who desires to keep in touch with the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. The work accomplished in the earth during the year 1932 is astounding. On this page in the previous issue we asked the readers to guess how many pieces of literature carrying to the peoples of earth the message of the Kingdom were distributed in one year. Many have received their answer by obtaining the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font7"> We take pleasure in telling you now that 22,213,639 copies of Judge Rutherford’s writings were distributed in 12 months. Now, wouldn’t you like to know where these 22 million, and then some, pieces of literature were distributed, and how, and under what conditions ? The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font7"> will tell you this in the most interesting manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. The other book, if you haven’t already read it, is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span><span class="font7"> The edition autographed by J. F. Rutherford, and containing a letter by him, has been ready for some time. There are still a few copies left. If you have not read the interesting presentation, by Judge Rutherford, of the two dramas in the Bible, the one of Esther and the other of Ruth, you still have many delightful hours ahead of you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">If you have both of these publications you might mention them to your friends; if you have but one of them, get the other right away; and if you haven’t either of them, you have overlooked or neglected something.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Causes of World Financial Distress </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By W. Sharples (England)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>In Two Parts—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE scrip issued had no value at the time (it was just a scrap of paper), but when the people have agreed to back this paper, then they have actually handed over everything they have to the State Department (which is run by the banks), and their trades, properties and wageearning capacities are mortgaged, in the case of the last war, for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Government has to resort to such a trick it is because it is insolvent. Suppose a business man through a trade war loses his money and then offers to deduct a portion of his workpeople’s earnings each week until his creditors are paid, that would be just an illustration of what is done. But, you say, the workpeople would not stand for it! No, but the workpeople of the whole nation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font6"> to!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>A Gilt-edged Investment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">So, during the war the national debt increased tremendously and the people were called upon to be patriotic, and with this wine well drunk and the war well on, they were completely in the power of the money masters of the world. The security issued to them for the money they pledged themselves to find had no more value than the paper on which it was written. If they bought a house they would not be satisfied to see the deed: they would want to see the house too. If they invested in a cotton mill, they not only would want their scrip, but would want to see the mill itself and to know that it was a working concern, turning out the goods that were to be produced with the money borrowed. But not so with this war scrip. The goods it bought, which represented its value, are all gone, blown to the winds with shot and shell! Yet this paper is a “gilt-edged” investment. Wherein, then, does its value lie? All the time the war is on it has no value, and the longer the war continues the less likelihood there is of its ever having any value, for the war might end disastrously. Even if it ends favorably there are many difficulties to overcome before it is quite certain this is a security of first-class value, and that is why the change over is needed from politician to banker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the bankers’ job to make permanent the specially created war securities and to see that this is done in such a way that the common peoples bear the burdens that have been occasioned by the &quot;war. The issuing of ‘war scrip’ makes this possible in the following manner; and be it noted that the bankers always stand to gain by a transaction of this sort, for the reason that banks and financial houses are permanent in themselves. The same people are almost generally in control for a lifetime, and whatever ills come or go they are unaffected by the same, as long as banks and financial institutions stand. The war scrip is reckoned as though it had behind it the usual pre-war gold and securities. Its capital amount has gone, but this is ignored. To be honest with the people this fact should be made known, and then the only honest way for the capital sum to be recovered, namely, by profit made out of trade, could be discussed. But this would show that the banks and governments were bankrupt, and it would never do to admit that. Scrip of this nature is always dealt with through the banks, and interest paid out therefrom, so every war increases their prestige, power, and wealth, provided that after the war is over such taxation can be levied as will meet the demand for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">interest</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sinking</span><span class="font6"> fund on all war scrip issued. If this can be arranged so that with the regularity and certainty that exists in times of peace the interest on the new security can be relied upon, then the “War Scrip” will have ceased to be a speculative investment and will have become a real “GiltEdge”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And that is not all. Nay, we should have missed the real point had we let the matter rest there. Here is a mystery revealed! Wien this has been accomplished, then a ‘scrap of paper’ backed by no tangible security will have become a living document, endorsed by the whole nation; and the capital sum which was once lost in the dust and clouds of war will again be alive and in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Usually capital is first subscribed and then made to bear interest. Here the position is reversed. The people's agreement to make the necessary sacrifices to pay the interest makes a lost capital sum again a reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, the bank in peace time has a fixed standard of value by which it regulates the issue and circulation of money. During the war this standard ceased to exist. After the war the process of adjustment which will reduce securities issued and money borrowed into line with pre-war standards has to be gradually brought about. To effect this, curtailment of the credit which has been expanded to allow the increased production necessary to carry on the war is resorted to. Why should this be necessary? Take the position in England.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Eight Thousand Million Pounds in Paper</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As the goods bought for war purposes in England had disappeared after the war, there was in existence a matter of nearly eight thousand million pounds’ worth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font6"> of paper security and only approximately the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">same</span><span class="font6"> amount of money as before the war. The ratio between money and security was therefore just this much wrong, and, if the ratio is to come back to prewar standards, then other securities must be sacrificed and this new scrip must take their place. And when an equivalent amount of trade and other securities has been lost, then Government scrip will have attained its rightful place. Or so think the bankers, and so think the governments; for both are tied to this war scrip, and if </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font6"> are to continue </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6"> cannot be allowed to fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the shutting down of trading concerns throws people out of work, these pay the price not only in cash as they lose their wages, but in suffering and want, privation and hardship, such as they would not endure a moment did they know the cause. Of course, the position of trade has assumed graver proportions than the banks intended, but this only serves to reveal still more clearly their foolish lack of understanding and the hardness of their hearts. It is devilish, this process of readjustment, and its real author is Satan, the prince of devils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The curtailment of credit means the curtailment of trade; thus come business losses which end in bankruptcy. Two things follow this: securities become defunct, thereby increasing the ratio of money to securities that remain; and what money is realized and remains during this process of liquidation seeks “safety first”, and naturally Government scrip is the most popular investment. Thus is pre-war balance restored, and the bank chuckles behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To put the matter another way: All profit originally comes from trade. War stimulates this and tremendous profits are made. But as fast as money is made it is needed to be spent on the war. It could not be taken out of industry, for that must be kept going ding, dong, making war supplies. So Government bonds are issued, and these roughly represent the nation’s trading profits, though sometimes in advance. The actual cash these ought to bring in being needed for industry, special arrangements are made to anticipate the cash passing into the hands of those who have to find the money needed to carry on the war. Book entries are made by the banks which swell their assets on the one side, as the specially created securities are reckoned as ‘gilt-edged’, though the banks know, of course, that it is make-believe, and the ledger is balanced as the huge sums needed are paid out in the same way, by cheques, of course. Actually the money does not at any time exist, just as there is no value in the security on the asset side. When the war is over and demand for war goods ceases, then the banks begin their policy of restoring the pre-war standard. As businesses close down through lack of credit owners have to part with war scrip, which always remains; and these find their way into the pockets of the rich and influential, the financiers and the bankers, who effect the exchange from falling trading securities to these new government certainties in the aforementioned manner.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Bankers the Only Certain Gainers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The only certain gainers are these same astute bankers. The people who buy in the first place seldom have the scrip in their possession when the change is completed (hence the ease with which the bankers keep the people ignorant) ; and do not let it be forgotten that the governments stand behind the banks until the scrip is entirely redeemed. The whole weight of the law is in this way on the side of oppression and fraudulent misrepresentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, the writer knows that if the banks’ policy were not thus put into operation it would mean their extinction, for of necessity since its issue they have always held the greater part of this scrip, against which much of their deposits has been loaned, and also for their own account; and its depreciation by twenty percent would have been enough to make them all bankrupt. As a matter of fact, this depreciation did actually take place, and, in 1921-22, all banks were threatened with collapse. One eminent banker in London said to the writer personally, ‘We are all ready to throw up our hands; we are done.’ But the papei’ rallied again as money left industry in the manner described and sought what the people thought to be sanctuary in these scraps of paper. If a scrap of paper started the world conflagration by being torn up, then other scraps were printed that carried it on, and in both cases there was camouflage and serious violation of the people’s trust. Thus did the bankers entrench themselves again as masters of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Bankers Double Their Income</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Now, what has been described is bad enough, but these moneyed barons made a further astute move. Not content with putting the burden of eight thousand million pounds onto the traders and the common people, they have further thought to enrich themselves by using the money crisis they have created to practically double the income of their class. Before the war gilt-edged security could command a matter of only two and a half percent interest, and now we see that it has been the bankers’ policy to restore everything to pre-war level except the rate of interest on investments. These have been for years stabilized around five percent. In addition, therefore, to being compelled to pay the capital sum aforementioned, the people have been made to double this in terms of comparison with pre-war values. In other words, five percent interest on eight thousand million is the same as two and a half percent on sixteen thousand millions. So, by making the people pay twice the rate of interest, the capital sum has been doubled and the war debt is paid twice over by somebody. And once over goes into some other body's pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, fourteen years after the war ended and because it is apparent that they have squeezed the traders like a lemon until there is nothing left, the Government has begun to reduce the rate of interest on investments by means of conversion loans; and at last it would seem to the people that those who have enjoyed such marvelous prosperity are really having to toe the line and pay their share by having a reduced income. Little does anyone know the wily schemes of financiers if they think this. For as soon as ever it is seen that such a course is to be adopted, and before the general public is aware, these men sell out of the stock that is to be converted and buy other Government bonds which bear at the moment less interest. This looks madness to the man in the street, but the financiers know a thing or two. They well understand that as soon as the rate of interest is reduced for the stock which is to be converted all other lower-interest-bearing bonds will jump in capital value until they get back at one operation all they lose on reduced interest. It is the public that will bear the loss; and the more innocent these people are, the worse they will fare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Always, these men have the money with which to carry out their operations. Only this past year (1932), in November, in three hours and a quarter a sum of three hundred million pounds was raised for just such an operation. There is plenty of money available, but such control is exercised that only certain favored ones can trade, and only then in the buying and selling of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">money!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Buying and Selling of Money</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Now from this point of view it is easy to be seen that the war did not impoverish the nations. On the contrary, after the post-war boom the world was far richer than ever before in history. Money had been created faster than at any other time, indeed without any precedent whatever. It is obvious that when a government owes any money it owes it to somebody or other and whatever sum is created increases the world’s wealth to this extent. The war cost the nations concerned in it at least fifty thousand million pounds. This much extra wealth, then, was created during four and a half years; and it was a permanent increase of the world’s wealth, as, being Government security, it had to remain, no matter what else was sacrificed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the rate of interest was practically doubled, the world after the great war was richer by a reckoned capital sum of one hundred thousand million pounds. That is why the world trade boomed while this money was left in circulation during the three years after the war was over. And that is why also stocks and shares and Government bonds boomed together with other gilt-edged stocks when credit was taken from industry after these three years, and why they continue to boom even now. The financiers are buying and selling the money created during the war. It is a trade after their own heart, without risk except the risk of revolution, and they think the military can look after that. Let us take another look at England, merry England, where “happy days are here again”(?).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total wealth of England is reckoned at thirty thousand million pounds. At least one-third of this huge sum was made during the war: first of all, by trading when everybody profiteered all they could, and, afterwards, turning that wealth into good fat Government scrip by the financiers’ coup herein described. The whole of this colossal sum brought an income of 3,120 millions to Britain in the year 1930. This included all money earned and unearned, including wages, salaries and unearned incomes. The workers and wage-earners, out of this fabulous amount, drew the magnificent sum of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">176</span><span class="font6"> millions. The rentier, interests and salaried classes took the rest, namely, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2,944</span><span class="font6"> millions. In order that we may see the matter more clearly, the following table is set out:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Who Gets the Money?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Official figures</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All people who draw any</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">money whatever in Eng</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">land, whether income, salary or wages, number .... 14,080,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out of this number, those</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">who get 55 shillings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">weekly, or less, number..... 11,880,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who get over 55 shil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lings weekly number ........ 2,150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 11,880,000 workers get</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">for one year’s work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(1930) .................. £175,448,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 2,150,000, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all other</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">classes,</span><span class="font6"> draw for one</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">year the balance, namely, £2,944,449,789</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When these figures are reduced to a weekly average the following is the startling result:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">£ s d</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All wage-earners under</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">55 shillings weekly average.............. 5 8 weekly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All who draw over 55 shil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lings weekly average .. 26 5 4 weekly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is the reason why there is need for the “dole”, as it is wrongly and wickedly termed. The amount of this in 1930 was about £120,000,000. With this added, it means the workers received an average of nine shillings and sevenpence per week with which to feed and clothe themselves and their families. That this is not enough does not need any proving, and is the reason why the rates of all towns have to be raised until the towns are nearly bankrupt, in order to give poor law relief in addition to the dole to eke out the scanty store of the poor. Then a Labor government is deserted by its prime minister and his henchmen so that a National (?) government might try to find a way to make these nearly twelve million workers see the need to give up some of their nine shillings and sevenpence per week so that “equality of sacrifice” might be maintained as those who have £26/5/4 per week are called upon to pay their share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we are on figures here are some more staggering statistics:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1920 England’s workers drew in wages .......... £949,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was boom year<sup>-</sup>1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1920 England’s rentier, salaried and income classes drew............£2,400,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also boom year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each year since there has been a tremendous drop in the amount received by the workers; but note the other classes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1930 England's workers drew in wages .......... £175,448,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">World depression!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1930 England’s salaried, rentier and income classes drew........... £2,949,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">World depression (?)!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A child can see from these figures that the workers now draw less than one-fifth of the wages paid in 1920, and the other classes draw £549,000,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font6"> than they got in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further, when in 1920 the moneyed classes had 2,400 million pounds to spend, the prices of all commodities were tremendously high. Now we are on a lower level. It is safe to say that the same money today will buy at least twice as much as it bought then. This reduction in the cost of living has been used as a strong lever to get the workers to submit to lower wages, and so in common fairness all other peoples, whether rentier, salaried or income-receiving classes would surely also be receiving less. But now we have seen that these actually have more than they ever had before; more money, yet prices of commodities less than half, and the rate of interest double what it was before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What more can they want, except the moon? Surely they have reason to thank their god Lucifer they are not as other men!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we have two classes clearly made manifest: those who have, and those who have not; those who have never had enough, and those who have not always had too much. And this is England, the land of “hope and glory”! or is it “dope and tory”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is therefore a marvelous prosperity on the one hand as the rich get ever richer, and the most abject poverty on the other as the poor get ever poorer. Whence is all this tending? and how long will it be before “The end is come” ? Even now we have a world crisis of the first magnitude. Why is this, if there is more monetary wealth than ever? and what does the present crisis portend? Let us consider these questions under the caption “Prosperity’s Ghost”; for it is a fact that the prosperity thus gained is just a ghost, and nothing more. Already it is vanishing even more quickly than it came, and soon, very soon, it will be no more.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Prosperity’s Ghost</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In 1927 an eminent British statesman said, “We are prospering”; “The standard is four points higher than in 1920, and this in spite of the fact that we have a million unemployed!” Now, the staple trades were all badly hit. Cotton, steel, coal, engineering, these were all in a very bad way. What, then, did he mean? Clearly, that luxury trades were booming, stock exchange business was booming, government securities were soaring. It was the feast before the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A nation’s wealth can never be reckoned in terms of money. For example: All the vaults in the banks can be full of gold and securities, but if crops do not grow and fruit were to wither on the trees, if the world became depleted of its raw materials and men’s work on the land became unproductive, then the world not only would be very poor, but would </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">starve and die. </span><span class="font6">Now, because there is a superabundance of all nature’s products, it is not recognized that the prosperity amongst the wealthy is only a sham, nothing more tangible than a ghost, and that in reality the world is as poor as though nature’s gifts were stinted and miserly. The fact of the matter is that when goods in superabundance are controlled by an obsolete system that cannot distribute them, it would be better if they were not in existence; for then the world would recognize equality of sacrifice to be a necessity, whereas its so-called “statesmen” cannot now see that equality of distribution is equally necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men used to be tortured, in the days of the Inquisition, by being chained up within sight of food and allowed to starve; and who cannot see that this is going on even now? Only there is now this difference: men are chained within the system. But they can break out into madness, with terrible results. But we digress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mammon is the god of all the nations, but the one to spin the wheel and keep the gamble going is Satan; and as ‘Mistress of the World’, especially this last century, clearly England has been his chosen nation. What is the use of England’s having an income of 3,200 millions, which is equal to twenty-six shillings and sixpence per head per week, when six out of every seven persons receive a matter of only about three shillings per week? They can spend only what they have! Now trade increases only in proportion as goods, nature’s products either in raw materials, foods, or manufactured wares, are distributed amongst the people. So the actual trade subscribed to by the bulk of the population is very small indeed. Whatever circulation of goods there is over the insignificant sum earned by the workers comes from the spending power of the other sixth of the population, and if the rich once get supplied with all they need or think they do, and the common people’s earnings are so restricted that they just have to go without things, then demand must cease and trade come to a standstill. As soon, then, as production becomes in excess of demand, and no matter how low wages and prices have previously fallen, the distribution of foodstuffs and raw materials and the manufacture and transport of goods gradually lessen. This naturally leads to a withdrawal of capital from these dying trades and this in turn seeks new avenues of usury in luxury trades or government bonds. It is not just that the rich are losing their wealth, but they begin to seek new avenues of investment, and the tendency is for capital to find usefulness in those branches of monetary activity outlined above, and these begin to boom entirely as a result of this available extra cash or credit. The wealthy, losing confidence in trade, use their surplus to buy stocks and shares and these are the things the banks like to see booming. Money turns over quicker this way than any other and financiers make their money out of this turnover in large measure. The turnover of the London clearing house for the year 1931 was thirty-four thousand million pounds (£34,000,000,000). This is four thousand million more than boom year, 1920. Yet trade is dead!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>A Surplus of Money Everywhere</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">That there is a surplus of money everywhere which cannot or does not find a useful service is evident to anyone; for notice the way every government loan or other important loan is oversubscribed in a few hours. Almost without exception all money thus required is oversubscribed ten times or more. So stock exchanges boom and money is turned over in a mad whirl as securities are traded in instead of goods. The gambling fever takes possession of the minds of the people and the hope is inspired that these might reap where naught has been sown. Financiers begin to promote companies, and anything is good enough to gamble with if it has a short record of prosperity. Tobacco or other promising shares are bought, and if the company happens to be paying a dividend of, say twenty-five percent, the value of the share is pushed up until the actual dividend received is somewhere in the neighborhood of gilt-edged-security level. Luxury trades of all kinds follow suit, and little by little everything that has any commercial promise in the view of the financiers is pushed up in share value on the stock market until all are in the region of standard interest-bearing securities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this way the money wealth of the country increases at the same time as trade in the common necessities of life decreases. Thus money leaves the staple trades, for these are dying, and seeks new life and greater usury elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It multiplies here also until the point of saturation is reached, and in a ver}’ few years the same conditions obtain in trade in securities as did in the necessities of life; for the law of supply and demand is inexorable and demand will cease when confidence fails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, when this happens, everybody wants to sell and there are no buyers; and when there are no buyers, then there is no bottom to the market. It matters not whether there are no buyers because there is no money, or whether because of lack of confidence, the result is the same, and when capital has left industry to trade instead in securities, then when confidence in these is disturbed there is no alternative investment for money, and so hoarding begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not having courage or wisdom to see that there is nothing for them to do to rectify matters other than to give up that which they have robbed the people of and restore the trade of the world in goods, and being entirely selfish, which selfishness has been aggravated by their own course of conduct until it has become branded into them as with a hot iron, they go from folly to blood-guiltiness as they seek to still further reduce the standard of living for the people in a vain effort to maintain their own position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once having begun, lack of confidence spreads like wildfire. Banks and financial institutions become fearful. Credit is further restricted, which only tends to make things worse, and money, by which alone the boom was made possible, becomes so tight that panic conditions prevail. The banks then realize that something drastic must be done. They cannot very well immediately reverse the policy of credit restriction, for this would but show that they knew perfectly well the cause of the rot and would brand them as rogues. So they endeavor by loans among themselves, international loans, etc., etc., to bear the strain which has been measurably self-imposed; and of necessity every such loan increases the burden and strain unless trade revives, and trade cannot revive until the people have money to spend, and people cannot have money to spend until trade revives.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>How the Workers Get Help (?)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">So, to help the workers wages are cut again, and to give confidence at home and abroad men and women are knocked off the dole; and then patriotic newspapers print the news that unemployment is decreasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, you wise men of the world, what wisdom is in you? Truly like the owl sitting on her perch, you look wise, but this is your wisdom seemingly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When trade is booming after the war because of money circulating freely you set about to stop it by restricting credit. You then begin to advertise to ask people to buy more with less money! This failing, you must needs begin to economize and thus make the people who have money to spend stop </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font6"> purchasing goods. You then say trade is bad because goods are too dear, and so you cut the people’s wages again to make them cheaper. Then you suddenly find trade is bad because prices are too low! and so you set about to raise these by artificial means, just to show how’ wise you were to say prices were too high. If you want to compete with the Japs, cut wages. If you want to gain Indian trade, cut wages. Of course the Japs will cut too, and then? Oh, cut again, and again, and again. Then, having got wages down as low as ever, you, when you still find the Japs are cheaper yet, then ask the good folk at home to patriotically spend the money they don’t get, and, if everything else fails, advertise, advertise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are not the banks bulging with cash? Then why don’t the people spend? Are not the warehouses bursting with goods? Then why don’t the people buy? Are the folk not hungry? Then why don’t they eat? Are the cows not giving milk? Then why not drink milk? Is there not coal in the ground, and miners out of work, and people wanting fires? Then why not------? But</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">then, you see, the wise men say, the system’s all right; we mean for it to stay!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So here at last we find that the prosperity enjoyed since 1921 when the “great” British statesman said “we are prospering”, has been like a ghost train. Setting off well laden it left Industry, in 1921, for Luxury town. Its occupants were gay and merry and they gambled and thought it great fun. A bought shares from B and sold to C, who sold to A to sell to B; and the £ from A became 21 to B, 22 to C, and 23 to A, who sold to B for 24, and C then swore he’d give no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But just then the train stopped at Newly Rich station, and in there came a Mr. D. This dud he bought instead of C and sold in turn to Mr. E, and twenty-four and six, you see, became twenty-six and four, believe me; and at every station the train did stop, and the bidding grew fierce and the wine did pop; and all on board their fortunes did make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And it now does appear there is the Devil to pay; for he drives the train, and there’s only one way to satisfy him. For how to buy money and be honest too might be known to the Devil, but not to me or you; and one thing is sure (is the Devil aware?), the ghost train he drives has got past e’en despair; it’s heading straight into the pit smoke and flame, of the Devil’s own making. So jump off again, all you who are on; let him drive in great state to his eternal home!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Retribution</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is now virtually impossible to avoid world bankruptcy. If the drunken captain of a ship at sea first starts shifting the cargo, then decides to bring it up on deck, and finally runs into a violent storm, it is not to be expected that a frantic last-minute effort will avail to keep the ship afloat; and “Christendom’s” ship of state with its cargo of gold and silver is just in that precarious condition today. Instead of the well ordered cargo’s acting as ballast to keep the ship afloat and weather any storm, gold has ceased to be other than a menace on board. In 1925, with the revival of the gold standard, the ballast was brought from the hold, to be sported with and admired on deck, where it was in full view of all, and the shifting of this cargo from one country to another as gold is sent back and to amongst the nations is just such evidence of the folly of her financial captains. The ship is rolling badly now; what will it do when the storm breaks? And even a child can see the gathering clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of this article we suggested that money could serve a legitimate and useful purpose purely as a measure of value and means of exchange. When people wish to reduce goods to a value that will enable them to obtain other useful commodities, then it could scarcely be done more easily than by measuring according to a fixed standard their value in money and reducing them thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there must be a fixed value world wide, and under the present system that is impossible. Money should never be allowed to trade in money; neither should it ever bear interest. The proper amount of human labor should always have a monetary value, but money should never be able to buy labor. The present system has got this matter completely twisted round, because Satan instituted the system for the express purpose of binding the peoples and keeping them in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So wealth, invested as it is in unproductive securities, almost the whole of which could well be dropped into the sea and would never' be missed, is an illusive bubble that will presently burst and vanish into the air. The things the peoples need and the getting of which would bring trade in abundance, namely, houses, food, clothing, electric light and power, and efficient sanitation, hygiene and transport, are neglected and allowed to die, and in their place is erected the god Mammon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Money is gravitating towards stocks, shares, and fixed-interest-bearing securities that are considered safe though unproductive, and this state of things was engineered by the bankers and financiers of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The devilish policy of these men has been to entrench themselves as earth’s rulers, Satan’s own scheme from the beginning, and so all who thus deliberately do are his children and do his will. Thus it is easy to see the why and wherefore of present conditions. Money is plentiful enough, but restricted as to circulation, and those in control are prosperous and powerful enough to dictate to governments. Their only fear is as to whether they can put over the load occasioned by the last war so that the people will bear it, and their fear is well grounded, for it is the day of reckoning and what is now done in a corner must be shouted from the housetops and the people shall know the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Earth Calls for Vengeance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The earth calls for vengeance on those who spill the blood of their fellow men, as well in peace-time as in war, by the slow and terrible torture of mind and body that is caused by starvation and semi-starvation in the midst of plenty, and this to gratify a wicked and lustful pride of rulership; and although Satan is primarily responsible, all others share this responsibility in accordance with the measure of support they continue to give the system after they can so easily see its wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the day of vengeance, and because it is Jehovah to whom vengeance rightfully belongs and who is the Judge, it will be absolutely just. For all must see and understand that ‘justice is the foundation of His throne’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Christendom” has sown to the god Mammon, and the rulers must now reap the fruitage from that sowing. As they have chosen to serve and worship money before Jehovah, they shall eat of the fruit of their own way. Money they have made their god; let it now deliver them. Their great and wise men have lauded to the skies their puny efforts to erect a system of world financial control; it shall now eat them up and make their folly manifest. The people have been bound by the devilish system of money and been made its slaves. Jehovah will now bind the rulers with it, and cause this very thing to enslave and subdue those who have misused its power so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sword was used also to bind the system on the people, and so, fittingly, the sword also binds it on their rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In absolute justice the results of the war were such that first it broke the money power' by the sword, and then it bound the monetary system round the necks of the rulers and slowly they are being strangled with it; and there is no escape, for it is easy to see they cannot change the system, but must perish with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If all had been agreed they might have made a better show, but all are selfish and think their policy best, and they will cut one another’s throat to get any advantage they can see, and they do not know that ‘Jehovah has set every man’s hand against his neighbor’s’. Do they not see the danger? Yea, verily; but to them finance is the only savior. They well know that to let it go will mean the loss of everything they love so well. It is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font6"> they love. They own the W'orld, it is tied to them by securities of one sort or another, and they will cling to these things even though ‘the end is come’; and before they go down Jehovah would have all the world know that these who have power are like Pharaoh of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Corn is being burned to provide fuel for trains, yet people are starving. Coffee is burnt rather than sold cheaply, in order to keep up prices for financiers. The bankers want cotton to be buried in the ground because there is too much for them to finance profitably! Rubber is burned, fish thrown back into the sea, vegetables and fruit allowed to rot; all this because ‘the system cannot cope with plenty for all’. And even when companies make much profit, note the foolish statements made (we quote from the annual report) : “At the annual meeting of the Sun Insurance Office in London Sir Win. Goschen proposed a dividend of twenty-five shillings and eightpence a share, and then warned the receivers that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">strict economy</span><span class="font6"> was necessary.” At the same meeting Mr. E. T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hargreaves hoped “that by this time next year we might not have the number of ‘parasites’ that are at present drawing the dole”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Power of Evil</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Now these things are done in “Christian” England; and in other so-called “Christian” lands the same things are done. They all together represent the power of evil, though they masquerade in sheep’s clothing. After the war these all had an opportunity to see the results of their wrong-doing and to repent, but they hardened their hearts. “Christendom” sits as queen over the nations, and she has drunk deep from the ‘golden cup’ and given to all nationalities; therefore they are mad. Consider again the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Silver was demonetized in 1873; with what results, we have seen. It brought great gain to this country because she kept a different standard, namely, gold. “Christendom” owns the gold mines; hence the standard. But how foolishly she has dealt -with the relationship of silver to gold since the war! As soon as her “wise men” thought that things were stable enough (following the war) to bear the strain of a return to the gold standard she instituted again this wonder-working ‘savior’, and thereby added yet other nails to her coffin. For what foolishness was this? Her wise men seem to have reasoned that ‘beforetime it worked so well, and why not again?’ But this time God’s judgment must be met: they must ‘eat of the fruit of their own way’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gold standard was in operation from 1925 until 1931, nearly seven years. Common sense would have reasoned that times were so different. When this system worked in favor of our financiers it was because all the world wanted our goods and we had a monopoly of manufacture. At that time these men thought that the world could pay, and pay it did, and silver was demonetized to make it possible for our financiers to reap an extra harvest without even our own manufacturers’ being aware of their astute move. Compelling the foreigner first to buy our gold before he could have our goods made him pay twice for every purchase, and the first payment went into the coffers of the bankers. That is how England became “the world’s banker”; for the wealth this brought was fabulous!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this worked only when our goods were needed by the foreigner, and in 1925 they were not needed at all. All nations had, during the war and just afterwards, become more or less industrialized, and machinery had simplified and multiplied and become almost foolproof. Other nations could now make their own goods, and everywhere our competitors increased. Where once we looked for markets and monopolized them everybody else looked now, and they began to undersell us, too. Why was this possible? Again we answer, “It was Nemesis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By introducing again the gold standard in 1925 we automatically began to lower the price of silver and thus increased the ability of the foreigner to produce at less cost than ourselves. A child should have seen this, let alone men of such vast experience in world finance as controlled money in England. For did not the raising of the gold standard in 1873 result in just the same depreciation of silver? Did it not sag, and sag again, for twenty years? Fools! Can you not see that this is the very reason that these foreigners have been able to send their goods into our own country, and we are full to overflowing with their shoddy goods in just retribution for our dumping on their shores for so many years the rubbishy goods we sent there? Now we are going to stop them by means of a tariff and so they will join the economic muddle, but this will not make us able to make goods any cheaper so as to compete again for world trade. The Japs can live in a tent; our workers could not live without a roof over their heads, and w<sup>T</sup>armth and clothing, for a single month. The Japs can live off a handful of rice, which they can grow’; wfliereas, even if our workers would be reduced thus far, we must import the food we need and thus provide some trade for the foreigner. What folly it all is! and it is too late to alter anything. “Christendom” must drink that which Jehovah pours into the cup of His indignation. God sent machines to lighten men’s burdens, and financiers turned them into a whip for the peoples’ backs in order to get fabulously rich. Now<sup>7</sup> these same machines have become men’s masters. The world is full of machines and some must be destroyed; but who will give way? They are multiplying the production of goods faster than the system can consume the output, and, because nations under the guise of patriotism are entirely selfish, each in turn speeds the machines and lengthens the hours. The heathen nations have now the W’hole of “Christendom’s” markets from which to buy machines, and each “Christian” nation is a competitor for their orders. As their wages and standard of living are so much less than ours, they can undercut our prices as long as undercutting is necessary. With our machines and cheap silver, with labor obtainable at absolutely starvation rates; with our nation carrying the tremendous burden of war debts which we cannot escape, and our businesses ruined by the bankers monetary policy, these heathen nations have stepped into our trade shoes. With them it is ‘Produce, produce’; and we are their markets as once they were ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our markets do not need finding: they are there for the nations to take when they will. They see the way we captured these, and go one better. “Christendom” has clearly shown the heathen that we are not all brethren, but that there are two distinct classes. They know now that by years of intensive training under oppression the common peoples have assumed the position of under dog, and these think there is an inferiority complex required of them by nature, and patiently they bear the great burdens they carry. Because of our so-called “Christianity” it is not possible for our big bankers and financiers to openly advocate slavery at home, and so there is a smoke screen of respectability thrown over conditions because of religion and this does prevent really devilish practices’ being openly put into operation. The heathen have no such disadvantage; so they can go one better. They examine our methods, seize upon their weak places, and put into operation a more nearly perfect machine-like system which does not even need some little provision for the poor; for no one will cry aloud at the horrors of slavery in heathendom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>England's Market Gone</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">So with the knowledge that cheap goods, produced by machinery and the poorest-paid labor, especially if credit can be given, can be sold in the world’s markets, they have got to work, and they have been, still are, and will continue producing goods at prices with which we can never hope to compete; and if we did not supply them with the machinery and credit some other nation would. For “Christian” nations manifest they are truly of one spirit, but it is the spirit of Satan, ultra-selfishness. They will take advantage of one another in any and every way to gain trade or other profit, and they have agreed to the principle of competition, and under this heading everything is fair in the trade Avar. Pride, oppression, legalized fraud, lies and murder (the latter called “Avar” for preference), they AA’ill countenance all these so long as one standard is kept by all, namely, 20/- in the pound; for this is Mammon’s standard to which all are expected to subscribe. If a man gambles and loses his money, there is nothing Avrong Avith this if another gamble enables him to pay. If, hoAvever, the policy of financiers in restricting credit forces anyone into bankruptcy, even though there might be no blame attached to the bankrupt, yet he is looked upon Avith scorn and shame and at best is pitied for a foolish lack of business acumen. The time has come to tear off this mask and let the Avorld knoAV the truth. Surely all can see that it is only Avhen those in authority and poAver can utilize their power to squeeze other people in order to meet Avar liabilities that nations will keep even their OAvn standard. To shoAV that even the monetary standard is not noAv kept by those who have poAver so to do, Ave find all the countries of “Christendom”, and some of the heathen, too, unable or unAvilling to pay their debtors. England cannot pay, so she says (it’s a lie, of course; for her rich men could, if they Avere so desirous of keeping their integrity, easily find the money among them to pay off America), and she beseeches America to accept installments, in order to squeeze the money out of her poor nationals. France cannot pay anything to England, though she can go on buying gold until her vaults are full Avith it. Much good it Avill do her by and by. Germany is like a squeezed orange; there is nothing left for anyone to suck. She cannot pay, and never Avill be able to pay, Avhat is claimed from her. America could have wiped out all her war debts, forgiven the nations what they OAved, and she Avould have made such a Avorld gesture as would have stamped her for ever as the land of liberty and freedom she claims to be. But what a sorry spectacle she has cut! With her vaults bursting Avith gold, her country reeling from too much money, she has capered about like a drunken man crying, “We must have more monish—hie; monish th’ thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But Avhile all these debts could have been Aviped out, that Avould have enabled the people to see Avhat Avealth the financiers and bankers had and Iioav easily they could, Avhen it Avas needed, supply the money to any amount; and these men Avere afraid, and probably rightly so, that people Avould begin to demand money for public services that would eventually take the power out of the financiers’ hands. Who cannot see that if only one hundred million of money were invested at five percent compound interest (and this is common enough in practice) in a matter of fifty years it would have grown to a thousand million, in a hundred years to ten thousand million, and in a hundred and fifty years it would have paid for the war twice over by accumulating one hundred thousand million pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, everybody knows it is impossible to use the money, or rather, shall we say, to save the money, in this way. There would be no possibility of investing such a sum, for it would smash all banks and businesses. Then that proves conclusively that the present system is unworkable and cannot support the demands of the new world. Away with such a monster! It compels the people to keep the idle rich on a five percent basis of interest, yet will not use this same rate to pay off the burden of the war. England has agreed to pay America so much money that the eight hundred and odd millions we owed to her will expand to well over two thousand millions by the time it is paid. The rich amongst the nations must have and give the pound of flesh; but it is the poor man’s flesh all the time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There is no escape for “Christendom” from the storm that all can see on the not far distant horizon. The world is rapidly changing. Countries that were once purely agricultural are fast becoming self-supporting industrially. With what significance Jeremiah says, in chapter forty-nine, verse fourteen, “I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.” The heathen do not need to come as a literal army; they can strangle us in our trade and cut us off from being a nation by withholding from us their products. What foolishness to talk of our blockading any country with our ships 1 The very food the sailors need has to come from some foreign part or other. How long will it be ere the heathen realize their weakness is due entirely to their own faction fights. Then they will combine in truth to put an end for ever to any domination from the west. Meantime things march forward as the Word of God has foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Russia depended for her manufactured goods upon her imports until after the war; but in the last twelve years, what a difference! She now clothes as well as feeds herself, and each year increasingly exports her surplus and enters the world’s markets. With immense mineral and other resources, a population that has to work to live, the best machinery she can first buy and then make, and with electric power increasing every year, she has become a menace to “Christendom’s” trade. Already she has reached the point where, as a preliminary to giving out orders for machinery, she demands and receives promise of all the blue prints relative to the orders placed so that she will have plans to make her own next time. At this present time all electric power plant is being made by Metropolitan Vickers on Russian soil under a five-year contract, and on the above terms. Hereafter, exit British electric corporations in Russia. She realizes her growing power, and, extending her successful five-year plan, which, in spite of capitalist countries’ denials, has been a great success, for a further five years, states that at the end of that time she will have taken the lead in all world commerce and will thereafter be able to make all her own machinery. Thus she is freeing herself from our civilization, save the word. Until now she has provided a market for “Christendom”, but this is rapidly to cease and we become her market instead. Now her exports will be her surplus, and these can be sold at any price they will fetch, much or little; and if she has cheap goods to sell, then we can be sure buyers will find a way to have them in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">China has the same tale to tell. Once she took tremendous quantities of British goods; now there is an ever dwindling trade. She has her eye on Russia too, and, lo, she has produced a ten-year plan. During this time she hopes to industrialize the whole of her country, and because we are desperate for orders we shall, in spite of the known facts, do exactly for her as we have done for Russia. We shall sell all the machinery she requires, send her men and lend her money to make the rod that will beat our own backs. We cannot complain: Jehovah is allowing the heathen to do unto us as we have done unto them, in order that these might see, and we also might understand, that righteous retribution will be meted out to all; and China is one of the silver countries and pays her labor with this metal, and she will make goods more cheaply than even Russia can. Already “Christendom&quot;’ sees her trade vanishing. Wait until China's internal strife is over. Then the sparks will fly!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Brute Force in India</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In India the British reign is ending. For a hundred years we have made India one of our chief markets, and kept it to ourselves with a proper British rule. A viceroy of regal mien, and more than regal splendor, was backed by a judicial system that forced respect and awe. These were supported by red-coated soldiers and officers of no mean attire, with all the necessary civilized war accouterments. Further, they were blessed by “the virtuous and womanly bishops and episcopals<sup>-</sup>’, who helped to make religious confusion worse confounded, a veritable Babel, as it was perceived that differing castes and beliefs could help to keep the people in subjection to British rule far more easily than bullets and swords. All this has come to the end. India awakes from her torpor, her senses no longer dulled by British dope. Recognizing the trade power weapon to be the surest way to strike a blow for freedom, she encourages home production and manufacture and boycotts British goods, and because her legitimate demands are not recognized she tries to protest in a peaceful way. Ghandi hates violence, but is a man of principle from which he will not depart. He is not to be allowed to even peacefully make his protest. And in order that the world shall see what Great Britain’s governors really are, Jehovah allows Britain to assert her old power and thus show the world it is, and ever has been, the sword. And force is being applied to try to kill the peaceful protest of India’s masses. Thus the sheep’s clothing falls off and the wolf is seen. How foolish to think an enlightened India can be again subjugated! but how stupidly British !</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now these three countries compose half the population of the world. When they cease to take British goods, then her chief markets are lost; and they have ceased already except for negligible quantities, and this will cease ere long. Already Russia is exporting, and the others will do the same; and where will they send their goods? Again facts show that we have become their market, and this will increase as their</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ability to manufacture grows; and they need not be paid in money: it need only be a matter of arrangement with other countries and barter can soon replace the present obsolete system. Already it has been tried and proved a success. Sweden is taking Egyptian cotton and sending machinery as barter. Germany is exchanging artificial manures for the same cotton. Hungary is treating with Lancashire for cotton and offering pigs in exchange. South America exchanges coffee for airplanes. And where is the power of the bankers to stop it? Aha! Their day is come! ’tis a time to laugh: the biter is bitten, and the wound is deep; the lifeblood of trade is flowing from the financiers’ grasp. Let them go on buying and selling their loved securities and living in the house built upon sand. The banks never made trade: it was the other way round; and without trade they cannot exist. While trade passes through their countinghouses they have its life in their hands. Keep it away, and they in turn will cease to live. Just now they juggle with their bits of paper and promises, and oft repeat, to still their fear, “All is well!’’ But they cannot continue unless trade revives; and trade is dead. So dawns the day Jehovah foretold, “Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon the whole multitude thereof”; and in the minds of some there is thought of war. If only Russia could be conquered again, perhaps the Japs ----; but they hardly dare; and if perchance they do, there are yet better weapons than tanks and shells. Let us name a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What if Russia or some other hard-pressed foe of capitalism should choose to make real silver coins, exactly like our own you know, millions of half dollars, not clumsy forgeries (because that is unnecessary, silver is so cheap), but perfect coins, and dump them with their goods. Would people accept them in payment for service and goods, or print a few hundred millions of good pound notes and send their airplanes over London town? Would the people pick them up and burn them, or would the hard-pressed business men, the out-of-works and, for that matter, the in-works too, gather up the spoil ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Methinks that guns are obsolete, and poison gas is not so quick as this new way would be, to make the nations want to lick their sores and sears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Maybe we’ll see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be a much better way than blowing one another up with bombs; for then indeed those who make wars would pay for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Come Near, Ye Nations, to Hear!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these days, when there is so much &quot;talk” of disarmament, it is well to remember Jehovah’s words spoken against the nations that have armed to the teeth while claiming to be His people: 'Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people; for the indignation of Jehovah is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their armies. He has given them to the slaughter; He has utterly destroyed them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This clearly proves that nations will not be allowed to disarm themselves. They have trusted in their arms and mocked at Jehovah, calling Him a 'bloody war God’; therefore in vindicating His name He is going to destroy them; and preparation for this vindication work we see working up to the great climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it not plain that now the world trade is tottering to its fall? But while this is true, once again 'Nero is fiddling whilst Rome burns’, and those who have power and wealth are so blind that they go on with their mad schemes of getting rich quick, playing with the securities and money they love so well. And the only sure trade that is left to the world is the trade in armaments, munitions, men of war, airplanes, guns and accouterments of war. And again in just retribution their very preparation for war must go on. And this is disastrous, for it is sapping the life of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They can talk as they will, but they well know it is all camouflage. They cannot even reduce armaments without seriously increasing the out-of-works and shutting down the only trade that still prospers. England spends at the present moment £200 (two hundred pounds) per minute on war, and all this brings abundant trade for those who are in this “trade channel”. And stop it, she cannot; she dare not: it would finish her; and well her statesmen know it. How can she cut off a trade that at the present time amounts to hundreds of millions a year? And so again the very thing they have put their trust in is the very thing to destroy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so we will leave the subject there. At the moment we see Mammon raised on high in all its pomp and show. That she holds a golden cup in her hand, none will deny; and that its contents are filthy, surely all can see. The wealth of this day surpasses a thousand times that of any other age. Some will still want to perpetuate the Devil’s wickedness, and these may be raised on high for just a little while. Soon, however, will come the fall, and, like a mighty mill stone cast into the sea, the system will disappear for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And when again Egypt (commerce) becomes Jehovah’s people, then blessed indeed will they be who will then use silver and gold in accordance with the divine will. Then we shall not have a repetition of the present chaos; for money will be used for trade alone, to bring about the legitimate and beneficial exchange of national and international goods for the benefit and blessing of all the nations. God hasten the day’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Forward, all Jehovah’s witnesses, to victory, and for ay'e!</span></p>

Nazi youths at the same time paraded the streets of Berlin singing, “When hand grenades burst all around, our heart's contentment knows no bound.” Press suspensions continue; the universities are controlled as to whom they may’ educate; educators have been forced out, and in some instances students and teachers thrown into the street and the doors nailed up. A repudiation of democracy and insistence upon the right of compulsory labor service are some of Hitler’s recent pronouncements. Nudism has been suppressed, and it has been estimated that there are as many as 3,000,000 persons in Germany<sup>7</sup> that adhere to this method of gaining or regaining health. All communists have been excluded from the new reichstag. Hitler is a vegetarian, and he neither drinks nor smokes. He has a hard job ahead of him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Your letter of May 9th carefully read. You have asked that we withhold the use of our facilities from Judge J. F.

In this you have asked me to assume a responsibility that I feel is not mine.</span></p>

Evidently Judge Rutherford believes that that Word very definitely advises relative to these conditions and is seeking to call attention of his fellow-men to the seriousness of these times. Upon inquiry, I find that within the last ten years his writings have exceeded a total distribution of a hundred and forty million copies. This evidences a very considerable number of people interested in the same line of thought. To assume the responsibility of withholding expression from this large number is something of more serious consequence than I would dare to assume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I ivould suggest that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> appoint someone to refute the statements of Judge Rutherford or accept the challenge to debate, which was made during his nation-wide broadcast, and to this end we offer the facilities of the station. The truth on any subject as discussed by radio does not require any more definite censorship than the right of the individual to turn the dial of his radio, and that right I believe must be left to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Another week and the wail had spread to New York, where </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Neus</span><span class="font6"> took it up, stating that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The protest by Mr. Zimmerman is concurred in by the Reverend Don Tullis, executive secretary of the Federated Churches in Cleveland, who said: ‘A great many Protestant ministers have resented the Watch Tower statements relative to established churches.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely they have. Of course they have. There was no serious difference between Annas and Caiaphas and Judas. They were all aiming at the one thing. They could not answer Jesus, and they were even afraid to try. The thing to do was to shut Him up or kill Him, and perhaps the best way to shut Him up would be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font6"> killing Him, for it verily seemed as if nothing else would keep Him from proclaiming the truths then due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is the way it is with Judge Rutherford and about Judge Rutherford. The clergy all sense that, and they are willing to commit any crime or any injustice if only this man’s mouth may be stopped. Meantime they play the crybaby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Desperately conscious that the pope cannot meet Judge Rutherford’s challenge, the Knights of Columbus of Ohio have met in convention and solemnly and foolishly “demanded” that he be cut off the air. They have just as much courage and just as much sense as the clergy that run </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Universe Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> none at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Introductory Health Program </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N ARRANGING any series of Health articles many factors must be taken into consideration, so that the person who reads them will gain the utmost information with the least expenditure of time and energy. Some, in fact most, who read these articles will be seekers of health, a few probably trying to keep that which they have been fortunate enough or wise enough to be able to retain thus far. In any event their interests are varied. Use indulgence and patience if you find that many things may not apply to your particular situation. Follow these articles carefully, because while you may not think a particular phase of diet interests you it may prove to be your salvation some day if not now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or you may be interested solely in diet, and try to correct all your problems from that angle. You then will benefit much by learning more about how to take sun baths properly, how to exercise and breathe properly. You will need to know about water-bathing, air and friction baths. You will want to understand healing crises or body reactions that you will go through on an eliminative regime. Perhaps you do not know the vitamins you lack, or do not know how to classify yourself as to your particular chemical deficiencies. Biochemistry is perhaps one of the greatest factors in arranging any diet, for all diet is good for certain things under certain conditions and for certain types at certain times; but do you know without experimentation whether all of these things are good for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ideas contained in the following articles have been gathered from many sources and represent a composite of common sense, as many different health exponents have found. Experiences of hundreds of scientifically minded people on the ideas of a proper health regime should be a fair criterion to follow. The experiences of thousands of human sufferers who have returned to health by such methods should add a double assurance that these suggestions are not mere fads and fancies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present effort is to try to simplify these ideas for health and diet so that the busiest person will have time to apply most of them. Efficiency is a matter of accomplishing the greatest amount of work, in the best possible manner in the shortest time. Health and efficiency go hand in hand. These ideas are for the person who is most sincere and most interested in getting the most out of life and rendering the greatest service to his fellow man in return. The happiest people are those who are able to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font6"> the most. We can accomplish little in life without health. It is the prime essential back of all activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is most necessary that you have this fact thoroughly impressed upon you before you read further. No matter how valuable the information contained may be, it will be useless to you unless you apply it. Wisdom is applied knowledge. Health is the result of the courage we display in using the information we already have. It is hoped that this article will help some to regain health, and also to keep well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While more will be said of diet in what follows than of other health subjects, it will not be because diet is a '‘cure-all”; but because it is one of the principal forms of obedience to the natural God-given laws of life. The things we eat help to make up the chemicals that activate every principle of life within our body. They not only influence and form the dense structure, such as the bones and muscles, etc., but actually influence our emotions and mental reactions as well. We can live finer, cleaner, more spiritual lives if we supply the body with foods that influence us in those directions. This is because of the intimate connection between the foods we eat and the ductless glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Condensed List of Health Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many important considerations in the matter of diet. The following are a few of the essentials:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need to eat </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">healthful, unadulterated</span><span class="font6"> foods in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">proper amounts,</span><span class="font6"> at the right </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">intervals, </span><span class="font6">in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">correct combinations.</span><span class="font6"> We need to eat foods that are suitable to our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">type</span><span class="font6"> of person and that are suited to our particular physical condition at the time. There are foods that are suitable for certain </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">seasons of the year</span><span class="font6"> and not for other seasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">climate</span><span class="font6"> in which we live makes certain dietary changes essential. No one would think of living on heavy carbon foods or heating proteins and starches and fats in a hot climate; no more than one would try to exist on orange juice and lettuce leaves in Alaska. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Occupation</span><span class="font6"> makes a difference in what we need. The active person can handle starches and proteins and fats better than the sedentary worker. The brain worker needs vitamins, mineral elements, greater amounts of non-starchy vegetables and fruits than does the outdoor man. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Proportion</span><span class="font6"> of food is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is best to avoid such articles as pepper and various seasonings, as they are overstimulating, causing too much digestive juice to form in the stomach, and later an insufficiency. They overstimulate the appetite as well, and are not digestible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Salt is a hardener of tissue. It is inorganic, and cannot be assimilated by the body. It has a detrimental accumulative effect. It is estimated that under average conditions of health the body is able to eliminate about fifteen grains of salt a day, and it is said the average person consumes around 200 or 300 grains per day. The use of salt in the inorganic state contributes to such conditions as kidney trouble, high blood pressure, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need natural salts; but these are obtainable in the natural state from green leafy vegetables, such as celery, spinach, onions, etc. When these vegetables are cooked they must be cooked so as to retain the natural juices, for it is in the juices that the mineral elements are largely found. Cook leafy vegetables in a very small amount of water, and cover while cooking. Do not cook too long, as cooking destroys the best elements of the foo.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must eat </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">slozvly,</span><span class="font6"> so that the stomach will be able to take care of proper formation of the digestive juices. It is said that about five percent of starch digestion occurs in the mouth; therefore proper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mastication</span><span class="font6"> is essential. The food must be liroken down, especially starch, if it is to be fit for digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We should not eat when exhausted or mentally agitated; because under conditions of agitation, anger, fear and other destructive emotions the endocrine glands are sending secretions into the system that are unfavorable to proper digestion of food. We should not eat when not hungry, because then the secretions of the stomach are not sufficient to take care of the food that is put in the stomach. We should skip a few meals until our appetite returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need more </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">raw</span><span class="font6"> foods; cooking devitalizes food and destroys to some extent the mineral elements. We need to get plenty of sunshine and fresh air. If it were not for the oxygen in the air we breathe we should not be able to utilize the iron that is in the food we eat. The greater the oxygen supply, the greater our ability to assimilate iron foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunsliine assists all functions of the body, and especially digestion. Exercise is absolutely essential, as it helps to maintain muscular tone and holds our organs in proper position so that they may carry on their functions from a muscular standpoint. Relaxation and sleep are essential, for it is during such periods that the body recuperates and does its repair work. If such periods are not provided the human mechanism wears out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The best food put into the stomach under the best possible conditions will do no good if the stomach is not in a healthy condition to properly carry on its digestion. Proper nerve supply to all vital organs is especially essential for this last purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mechanical misplacements of the spine greatly handicap digestion. So any health method that will restore tone to the body, cleanse the body or correct these mechanical difficulties will greatly improve health in any sick person and will do much to keep in a condition of health those who are already well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the principal things the sick person must remember is that nature is no respecter of persons. Health is gained and kept by proper living. Nor has anyone ever been able to discover or invent a substitute for natural living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Body Reactions or Healing Crises</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All health regimes require preparation, no matter how simple they may be. No one ever thought of building a house without first estimating the amount of material it would take, the probable cost, the length of time to build, etc. The same is true with health. The reason why health methods are often criticized as being ineffective is that the person applying them either did not understand them properly or else was not told what to anticipate when he did apply them. The most effective health measures have the most drastic reactions, just as the best house-cleaner often creates considerable consternation in a household when she is really giving a house a thorough cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The body is so constructed that it is self-protective. This being true, anything taken into the body that is not harmonious with the best functioning of that particular body will immediately stir up trouble. Finally, however, the body passes what we might term the stage of ability to protect further. It is then that elimination slackens, the functions become sluggish, and disease results. Disease is nothing more</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nor less than the inability of the body to assimilate and eliminate properly; or, we should say more truly, disease is lack of ease, or disturbed function or structure. I speak of the assimilative and eliminative functions particularly because they are most frequently involved when dietic errors are long continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to understand healing crises we must understand first normal body functioning, and that they are a sign of renewed body activity in an already sick body. They are positive evidence that the body has reached a point where it is able to throw off the poisons or toxins that have accumulated in the system by years of incorrect living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead, therefore, of being frightened over these reactions or healing crises, we should do everything possible to carry them to a successful termination and be grateful that the body has enough recuperative energy left to carry on these constructive and life-giving processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Often years of drugs or other suppressive treatments or very poor eating habits have so severely poisoned the system that the reactions necessary will be in proportion to the amount of poisons that have accumulated and the vitality of the patient. Usually, the more severe the reactions, the more quickly one can hope for recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These toxins or poisons accumulate in different ways. Years of incorrect living, such as persistent lack of exercise, improper breathing and, especially, not enough oxygen, wrong eating and overeating, excess of certain chemical elements, improper combinations of food that generate fermentation and gases, nervous strains, emotional excesses, lack of proper sleep and recreation, all these things and many others enter into our present system of living and help to destroy health and vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we reorganize our living conditions we find the trend is toward elimination, cleaning out, or as we technically term it, a “healing crisis”. These reactions are especially noticeable during a cleansing diet containing a great many fruits and vegetables, especially if the diet is also low in the more concentrated foods, such as starches, proteins, sugars, etc. It is still more evident during fasting or a fruit juice diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eliminative treatments, such as various drugless methods, chiropractic, osteopathy or anything else that may be used by the patient to hasten the body’s return to normal functioning, will stimulate these reactionary symptoms. Sun bathing, water and air and friction baths, correct breathing, regular exercise and all other healthful measures help these processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One must know what to expect when starting to follow a health program, otherwise he may grow discouraged and stop at the point when he is getting the most results, or may do something that will interfere with this constructive process, and really be worse off than if he had never started elimination at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In fact it is because people do not know how to lead up to and come back from the more drastic diets and fasts that they have grown to believe them dangerous. The same is true of different healing methods that have as their basis body reconstruction. It isn’t the method or the system that is wrong; the wrong lies in the fact that the patient has not been educated as to what to expect from the treatment or diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Symptoms op Healing Crises</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are many and varied, according to the type or condition of disease, the vitality of the patient, etc. Frequently there may be loss of weight, mental depression, irritability, extreme nervousness, a sense of lassitude or loss of strength. Often there are digestive disturbances, such as gas, fermentation, sour stomach, diarrhea, biliousness, flatulence, occasionally vomiting and purging, often accompanied by a feeling of fear, hopelessness, etc. Often the patient will have an extreme revulsion against natural foods for a while, and everything connected with natural living. This is the very time to remain faithful to the regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Patience is most necessary, and these feelings will soon be replaced by a feeling of buoyancy and mental peace and rejuvenation as well as physical well-being that is hardly possible to conceive by one who has not experienced it. Before this, one feels he is growing worse instead of better; but remember, disease can never be removed by repressing it. It can be eliminated only by bringing all the old accumulated poisons back from the tissues into the circulation and from there throwing them out of the body through the channels of elimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As this house-cleaning goes on and the waste materials are being eliminated through the mucous membranes of the nasal passages, the throat, the bronchial tubes, the stomach, the bowels, the urinary tract, they often cause irritation and congestion and thus produce the well-known symptoms of inflammation, and catarrhal elimination, and ofttimes skin eruptions, boils, abscesses, fever, pain, etc. Sometimes one will have a coated tongue and a foul breath that will grow worse until the system begins to clear. When the tongue begins to clear at the tip, and hunger returns, you may feel that your system is getting back to normal. You will then begin to assimilate, put on weight, gain strength and reserve, etc. This is a dangerous period, and a most careful return to regular but healthy living conditions must be made, especially if the patient has been fasting. The wrong foods taken at this time will do more harm than at any other time, as will any form of suppressive treatment. It is the most essential time to give nature a chance, because it is exerting every effort to cleanse and purify your body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Letter to Judge Rutherford Which All Our Readers Will Appreciate</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">533 Beech Street Waterloo, Iowa April 30, 1933 Judge J. F. Rutherford Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Judge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have preached 54 years, heard many popular preachers, read many noted sermons on the kingdom of God; but nothing to equal your exposition of that kingdom in your radio sermon this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please send me a copy of that sermon. I estimate that sermon will convince, and awaken thoughts along correct lines that will convert millions to your plans of developing that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With world fraternity, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yours for that kingdom,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Untermyer’s Tribute to the Stock Exchange</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">amuel Untermyer, in an address at Los Angeles before the law alumni of the University of Southern California, paid the following compliment to the New York Stock Exchange :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By resort to certain legal fictions it has built around itself an impregnable wall of immunity, behind which for a period of well over half a century there have been intermittent sorties of hordes of vultures operating exclusively through the intricate machinery set up by these favored members of the Stock Exchange who wander forth at will, swoop down upon a defenseless public and pluck at its very vitals with impunity. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On May 17, 1792, under a buttonwood tree at what is now 68 Wall Street, New York City, 24 brokers subscribed to an agreement which established the first organized stock market in the city of New York. A constitution was adopted in 1817, and on April 8 the exchange moved indoors at 40 Wall Street. The exchange, which is by all odds the greatest gambling institution in existence, is not incorporated, keeps out of encyclopedias and shuns the light. A seat on the exchange has sold as high as $625,000. This was in 1929. Two years later, on one occasion, a seat could be had for $125,000, but that is now considered a very low price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Schoolbook Racket</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TN A LARGE number of the states textbooks used in public schools are dictated by a combination of publishers. In Canada they are prepared under the direction of the government, and printed by private publishers who submit bids. The maximum price at which the books may be sold is fixed by the provincial government. The prices parents pay for books in some of the states is from two to nine times as much as is paid in Ontario. And the Schoolbook Trust in the LTnited States manages to change textbooks frequently. It spends large sums to control school board elections. All of this is undoubtedly “good business”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Earth’s New Ruler</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH has a due time to reveal His purposes. Among the important things now due to be understood by those who love Him is the fact that a new ruler is reigning a-s the representative of Jehovah. That fact is important in this day of restlessness among all peoples, a day of dissatisfaction with earthly tyrants, a day of quick and hasty<sup>7</sup> changes, and when the Devil, who knows that his time is short, faces complete and overwhelming defeat. It is necessary for the people to know that the new Nation has been born, that the Ruler has come out of Bethlehem, and under His banner alone the people will find protection and happiness. Few people know, and a still smaller number appreciate the fact of a new government; this new nation is gradually yet surely pushing all opposition aside; man finds his goal and happiness as he lines up under the new banner and sings praises to the great God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a long time man has thought that the birthplace of Jesus at Bethlehem was the source of a promised deliverer. And while it is true that Jesus was born at that particular place, yet the prophecy of Micah 5: 2,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">has a much broader and a modern application. From the birth of Jesus to the end of His ministry He fulfilled in miniature the aforementioned prophecy. There must be a greater’ and complete fulfilment thereof, and that comes to pass when Christ Jesus comes out of Bethlehem and becomes the Governor of the world. The fulfilment in completion has its beginning at the time when God places His beloved Son upon His holy<sup>7 </sup>hill in Zion and says to Him: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” And again: “I shall give thee the heathen [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”—Psalm 2:6,8; 110:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, whose name means “beloved”, was a ty<sup>7</sup>pe or foreshadow of Jesus, the beloved Son of Jehovah. David was born at Bethlehem. Jesus was born at the same city. “Bethlehem” means “the house of bread”. Jesus said of and concerning himself: T am the bread of life that came down from heaven.’ Upon that bread all must feed who will get life. David brought the people of Israel up to a state of prosperity. Not only<sup>7</sup> had he the desire to feed the people, but he possessed the ability<sup>7</sup> and did so. Jesus Christ is clothed with all power and authority, wholly devoted to His Father, and is carrying out His Father’s purposes to bring all obedient ones of mankind into a state of prosperity. David was the hope of Israel. Jesus became the hope of Israel according to the spirit, and through His house He is the hope of all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bethlehem Ephratah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bethlehem Ephratah was a place of fruitfulness. It was a city in which were centered the promises of God. It was small among other cities of Judah, but it was of great importance because out of it must come the Ruler. The identification of the Ruler is made certain by the words of the prophet in the text first above quoted, which speak of Him as one “whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting”. He who is the active agent of Jehovah in the creation of all things, whose name was the Logos and later Jesus, is the One who must come out of Bethlehem and of whom David was a type. When Jesus was born in Bethlehem the prophecy<sup>7</sup> there had a measure of fulfilment. Other matters, such as “the Assyrian”, mentioned in the prophecy, aside from the birth of Jesus, did not have a fulfilment then, and surely it could not be said that the prophecy had a complete fulfilment at the time of His birth. At that time there was no invasion by<sup>7</sup> the Assyrians, as foretold by the prophet Micah. Furthermore, in the vision Micah saw the war carried into Assyria and that land wasted. Nothing of that kind occurred at Jesus’ birth. It would indicate, however, that in the complete fulfilment the part of the prophecy relating to the Assyrian would be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time of the complete fulfilment is indicated by<sup>7</sup> chapter five, verse three, which reads: “Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.” In the year 1914 (A.D.) Zion (God's organization) brought forth the “man child”, which must rule the world. (Isaiah 66:7,8; Revelation 12:5) That marks the time of the birth of The Nation (God’s kingdom) and the bringing forth of the King or Ruler. It was the time when God placed His anointed One upon His throne.—Psalm 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The complete fulfilment of the prophecy, therefore, is indicated, and that it would wait</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">until the time that Zion travails and brings forth. Then would follow the war in heaven. After that, Zion brings forth her children. “For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children,” including the remnant. (Isaiah 66: 8) The prophecy of Isaiah therefore concurs with the prophecy of Alicah, to wit, that “then the remnant of his brethren shall return”. The Scriptures make it clear that there was a remnant of Israel after the flesh and that such remnant foreshadowed the remnant of Jehovah's witnesses that would be manifest after the Lord conies to His temple. All who have been brought into the body of Christ by adoption since Pentecost are brethren of Christ Jesus. (Heb. 2:11) But now, after the birth of the nation that must rule the world, and after the Lord comes to His temple, the remnant of Jesus’ footstep followers is brought unto God and into the temple condition.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Bread of Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was on earth He fed His disciples upon the Word of Life. But even His disciples did not fully appreciate the food received at His gracious hands until after Jesus ascended into heaven and the holy spirit was given to them. There is a long interval of time between the miniature fulfilment and the fulfilment in completion of Micah’s prophecy concerning the Ruler out of Bethlehem. That time is mentioned in the words, “Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth.” After the birth of The Nation and the bringing forth of the children of Zion the Lord then began to feed His people and they appreciated it more than at any time prior thereto. The prophet says: “And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God; and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.”—Micah o: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy does not mean that He stands and feeds himself. Clearly it means that after coming to His temple He feeds His own people. Undoubtedly the prophecy refers to the same time Jesus mentioned when He said: “Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.”—Luke 12:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Ruler, having come out of the greater Bethlehem (the house of bread and a place of fruitfulness), girds himself and causes the faithful ones to sit down, that is to say, to rest in peace, while they receive the gracious provision made for them. As Ruler of Zion, Christ Jesus as a Shepherd stands up and feeds the members of the household, who compose the “faithful servant” class; and He feeds them upon that food which is 'convenient for them’. This means they are fed upon that which builds them up. This part of the prophecy has been marvelously fulfilled since 1922, as many of the faithful can joyfully testify. It is since that date that the Lord Jesus, the Head of Zion, and the perpetual Ruler of Zion, has fed His household bountifully upon present truth. Surely there has been a feast spread for them in the presence of their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant will call to mind the sustaining food the Lord has given them from the temple during the past few years. It is not man’s food of truth, and no man has given any of it. It is Jehovah’s truth which he provides and serves to His people through Christ Jesus. The Ruler who has now come out of Bethlehem, clothed with all power and authority, stands forth “in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God” and feeds His people upon the food which Jehovah has provided for them. He feeds those who need to be fed and who rejoice at receiving the food. It is the Ruler that is serving the food from His Father's storehouse, even as He foretold by His own words.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Precious Things Revealed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">We do well to recount some of the precious things that the Lord has brought to His servants. He has made it clear to them that the world has ended, and that the new nation is born (Revelation 12:1-17); He has disclosed to them the enemy’s organization and has shown to them that that evil organization is to be overthrown ; He has given to His people a double portion of the spirit, and has shown them the importance of being zealous and faithful witnesses to the name of Jehovah; He has shown them the significance of Jehovah’s name and that it is now the privilege and duty of the anointed to exalt that great name in the earth; He has made it clear to them that it is the Creator, and not the creature, that is to be exalted; He has disclosed to them what constitutes “the joy of the Lord” and has invited the faithful ones to enter into that joy, and they have done so; He has shown them that the great battle just ahead is the fight of Jehovah God against Satan and that it is the privilege and the duty of the anointed ones to sing forth the praises of Jehovah as He proceeds to the destruction of Satan’s organization; He has shown them that it is the privilege of every one now to tell forth the good news as witnesses to the world. —Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth which these witnesses have received so graciously at the hands of the Lord is not to be used selfishly. It is to be used according to the direction of the great Giver. He has commissioned His witnesses to declare His name and to announce to the people their only hope in the establishment of God’s kingdom. It is this truth that gives them the ability to be able witnesses at this time, and it is the enlightenment from the Lord that is used by them to honor the great God and to comfort all that mourn. At no other time in the history of mankind has there been greater necessity for the people to know and appreciate the fact that Jehovah is the God, and that Christ Jesus the new Ruler is already exercising His power. To know and cooperate with the new Ruler and become a part of the new arrangement which Jehovah is establishing is fundamentally necessary to man at this time. It is only as man cooperates with the new Ruler that he functions according to the purpose of the Creator, and it is only when fulfilling that purpose that man can enjoy the greatest possible measure of happiness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>The Warfare</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Any</span><span class="font6"> band of people who announce the establishment of God's kingdom as the only possible relief for mankind will draw the fire of the enemy. And this is exactly what has happened in the past few years. The prophet shows that “the Assyrian” will make war on the remnant. “And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land; and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.” (Micah 5: 5) Undoubtedly “the Assyrian” is one of the names of Satan’s organization. This prophecy is in exact accord with the words in Revelation: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17) While the enemy is making an assault upon the anointed the great Ruler out of Bethlehem is the peace of the remnant. He is the great Prince of Peace upon whose shoulder the new government rests. (Isaiah 9: 6, 7) He comes as the executive officer of Jehovah to establish peace, but first He must make war and overthrow the enemy. (Revelation 19:11-14) The faithful members of the remnant are with Him and follow Him because He is the Head of Zion and Jehovah’s beloved officer; the remnant trust Him and are at peace. He is their Redeemer, their Lord, and their King, and they have complete confidence in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Assyrian, the Devil and his agencies, attempt to invade the citadel of the temple class and to destroy and to break down the members thereof. In the attempt to destroy the remnant the enemy meets up with real opposition. The great Ruler out of Bethlehem continues to feed and strengthen the remnant, and with full confidence they go on in God’s service. They are not deterred by the enemy, because they know that almighty power and boundless love are being exercised in their behalf. The mighty hand of Jehovah is over them and they are safe and secure as long as they remain faithful to God. (Isaiah 51:16) It is love that constrains and holds together the remnant class. That means that they are unselfishly devoted to the Lord and are unselfishly doing their best to safeguard the interest of one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet says: “Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men.” Seven being a symbolic number for completeness, this scripture seems to say that all the shepherds, meaning all the remnant, are looking out for the interest of their brethren. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font6"> renders it “eight princes among men”. The number eight is one above that which is complete or perfect. This may well mean all the faithful remnant and their Chief and Head, “the man Christ Jesus,” who safeguards the interests of the people of God against the assaults of the Devil’s organization. He is the One who leads the fight and gains the victory. This prophecy seems to say that all the remnant, being faithful to the Lord, present a solid, compact body against the enemy and for the Lord. They pray for peace in their own ranks and put forth their best endeavors to see that their course of action is in harmony with the truth.—Psalm 122: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s people have made an emphatic declaration against Satan and for Jehovah. That means a fight. Through His prophet Micah, the Lord says to them: “Now gather thyself in troops, 0 daughter of troops; he hath laid siege against us.” (Micah 5:1) Jehovah of Hosts is the mighty God of troops coming forth to war, and Christ Jesus the Euler out of Bethlehem is the Field Marshal going forth to make war. The remnant class must take its place in the battle array. The part of the remnant is to sing as preparation for the battle is being made and when the battle is being fought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the prophet indicates the course and result of the battle: “And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.” (Micah 5:6) These words are in accord with the prophecy of Isaiah (13:1-9) and of Jeremiah (25:30-35) It is the battle of the Lord God Almighty. It is Jehovah who causes the enemy to be destroyed, and at the same time He delivers His own people; and this deliverance takes place at the time the Assyrian assaults the people of the Lord. This fact is another proof that the complete fulfilment of the prophecy concerning the Ruler out of Bethlehem takes place at and after the Lord comes to His temple.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>Blessings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Following the great battle, as indicated by the words of the prophet, there comes a time of blessing upon the people, and in this the remnant will have some part. “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.” (Micah 5:7) The remnant are shown in the midst of the people as “dew from the Lord” and as “showers upon the grass”, and these words indicate comfort and blessings to the people. This may be taken as an indication that some of the remnant will be on earth even after Armageddon is fought and will then have some more work to do in the name of the Lord and to His praise and glory. The people, having passed through the great, terrible trouble, will no longer look to man for help nor watch for the sons of men to bring them aid and comfort, but will turn to the Lord and gladly hear His Word. Some creatures will have the privilege, as the Lord’s agent and messengers, of bearing the message of peace to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant of the Lord, according to this prophecy, will go on to triumph in the strength of Jehovah. A lion is a monarch among the beasts of the field, and none can stand before him. The flocks of sheep are without power against a strong and young lion amongst them. Thus the faithful remnant of God is described by the prophet. These shall be amidst the nations of many people strong and vigorous in the name of the Lord to help those who want help and to point out God's method of destroying those that resist. “And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and tear-eth in pieces, and none can deliver. Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.” (Micah 5:8,9) These words of the prophet seem to warrant the conclusion above suggested. The 'hand lifted up against the adversaries’ means that God’s power will be exercised against all adversaries and all enemies of the people shall be cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great Ruler who comes out from Bethlehem completely dashes to pieces Satan’s organization and will rule the nations with a rod of iron and establish everlasting peace. The prophet Micah gives a description of the complete overthrow of all organizations and systems which Satan has fathered and nurtured and used to oppress the people. “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots; and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds; and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers; thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities. And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.”-—Micah 5:10-15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Summary</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It therefore clearly appears that not all of this prophecy could have had a fulfilment, and not all did have a fulfilment, at the time Jesus was born at Bethlehem or during the period of His ministry on earth. Its greater fulfilment is now in progress, and those in the temple class are</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">privileged to see it as Jehovah’s lightnings from time to time reveal these truths to them. The food which the Lord is now providing and serving to His household should and does encourage, comfort and strengthen the members thereof. Step by step He leads His people on. At this time it is clearly seen that He has put His words in the mouth of the remnant and sent them forth as His witnesses. Remaining in the temple class, these must continue to be faithful and true to the Lord and to show forth His glorv.—Psalm 29:9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a time of great peril. (Revelation 1G: 15) Each member of the remnant class must now be on the alert and always watchful. He must stand firmly on the Lord’s side. He must take advantage of every opportunity to serve the Lord by singing forth the honor of His name. With gladness and joy he will declare Jehovah’s doings among the people. Herein is the safety of the remnant. The favorable position of the anointed ones now cannot be overstated. If the Lord has given you the opportunity to have part in His service as one of His witnesses, see to it that you do not slack your hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Safety means to abide in God’s great fortress, in the shadow of the Almighty; and to abide there one must be in the temple class proclaiming the glorious name of Jehovah. While the forces of evil are marching on to battle, the remnant will not be afraid. They see that the great Ruler has come out of Bethlehem, and that He is the mighty Executor for Jehovah God, and at God’s command He goes forth to the destruction of the enemy and to the complete establishment of righteousness on earth. He will continue to feed all those who continue to trust in and are wholly devoted to Jehovah God. Such will now with confidence and joy say: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.” (Isaiah 12:2) “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.”—Isaiah 26: 3.</span></p>

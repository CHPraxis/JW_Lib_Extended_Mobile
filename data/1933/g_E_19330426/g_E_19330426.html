<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Way of Escape</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">(Broadcast and recorded by Judge Rutherford over chain and key station WBBR, Sunday, April 16, 1933)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HIS speech is not an expression of man’s opinion. If it were merely the expression of my opinion I would not expect you to listen. It is a statement from the Bible, which is the Word of Jehovah God, backed up by facts well known to millions of people; and for that reason alone it commands the respectful hearing by every reverential person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than a century ago the peoples of the American continent believed the Bible to be God’s Word of truth, given for the instruction and guidance of man; and there are yet many good people who so believe, and to such this speech will be a message of comfort and good cheer. Its effect upon those who are opposing Jehovah’s work on the earth will be anything but comforting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This speech is not made for the benefit of the clergy, because they have ignored the Word of God and substituted therefor their own wisdom. They have been duly served with notice of warning and have closed their ears and their eyes to the truth and caused the persecution of those who brought to them the message of God’s kingdom. Further notice to them would be of no avail. This speech is not intended for the commercial giants nor for the political rulers, because they have heretofore been duly served with notice and given warning, and that information has been ridiculed by most of them, and they have given ear to the enemies of God and have hindered the further proclamation of His truth. Further information given to such opposers would be needless. There are a few men among them, however, who still have a hearing ear; and I hope that these may receive some benefit from this message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah’s covenant people were suffering from oppression in Egypt, God sent Moses as His messenger to give notice of warning to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and to comfort</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">His own people. That message of warning was from Jehovah, and Moses was merely His servant to bear the message. When Pharaoh rejected the message of warning Jehovah said to Moses these words: “Speak now in the ears of the people.” Likewise the time is now at hand when the rulers have rejected God’s message and in accordance with His will the people must hear and have an opportunity to take their stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The peoples of the nations of earth are now in great distress and perplexity. They are greatly in need of encouragement and consolation, and Jehovah God has a message of consolation for them. It is to the people of good will I now address this speech. You must now learn what is the real cause of the present distress upon the world, what may be expected to follow shortly, and what course you can take for your safety and preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please be assured that I have no controversy with the clergymen nor with the political or commercial rulers. My sole duty is to speak the truth. If you believe in Jehovah God and His Word of truth you will appreciate the fact that Jehovah has given commission to all who have devoted themselves to Him, and this commission they must perform. Christ Jesus is the great “faithful and true Witness” of Jehovah, and all those who are the true followers of Christ Jesus now on earth are Jehovah’s witnesses and must bear testimony. The commission definitely given to all such is set forth in Isaiah 61:1, 2 and, among other things, says to His anointed: ‘Jehovah God has commissioned you to preach the good news unto the teachable, to proclaim the day of the vengeance of God against all wickedness, and to comfort all that mourn.’ God’s vengeance is against Satan and his entire organization; and when He sends His witnesses out to declare this message of truth, and they fail or 451</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">refuse to obey, His witnesses shall die. (Ezekiel 3:18) Those who really love God prove it by obeying His commandments regardless of what men may think, say or do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now as to some of the facts which you well know and which have to do with the fulfilment of divine prophecy. The World War began in 1914 between the nations called “Christendom'’. Eighteen hundred years before that the Lord foretold that war and that it would be the first evidence of the end of the world. During that World Wai’ the ruling elements invented and caused to be shouted throughout the earth the slogan: “The war will make the world safe for democracy.” That slogan was a false prophecy. Today there is not one democracy on earth, but most of the nations are ruled by dictatorial power. I am not here criticizing the dictators, but merely citing the facts. Millions of men were preached into, urged and driven into the World War, and most of the survivors are now in want and suffering for the necessities of life. In a land where there is said to be too much food, too much raw material for clothing, too many houses, there are at the same time millions who are in great need of food, raiment and shelter, and are unable to enjoy these necessities. Everyone knows that there is something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the rulers are desperately trying to pull the countries out of the state of depression and to prevent the ship of state from going on the rocks. Let it be conceded that such rulers are doing the very best they can according to human wisdom. They are disregarding divine wisdom. They may succeed in a measure and there may follow a short period of material prosperity and, if so, that will cause the rulers to become more arrogant and to further ignore or defy Jehovah God and His kingdom. If material prosperity does come to you, and you have relief even for a short time, I shall be glad; but do not be deceived thereby nor let anyone turn you away from the truth of God’s Word. Whatever material prosperity comes, it will be followed by even greater distress. There is no earthly power that can pull the nations out of their present dilemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nations of “Christendom” in recent years have made numerous peace treaties in an attempt to safeguard the world from war; and let it be conceded that they have done this with a sincere desire for peace. The facts, however, are that at this time all the nations are arming to the teeth and are desperately preparing for Avar, and expect war, and they know not the reason why. Fear has taken hold upon all of them and they quail and tremble because of what they sense is coming upon the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God's Word of truth plainly points out that the most terrible war, and the greatest death toll ever taken, is in the very near future. Jehovah God has laid upon His witnesses the obligation to now make known these facts to the people. The Bible gives plain proof as to tire reason for this coming war and what will be the result, and plainly points out what is the only way for you to escape and preserve yourselves and live. The message, therefore, is of vital importance to every one who desires to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God made the earth and placed perfect man upon it He appointed Lucifer as overlord or god of the earth. Lucifer rebelled against God, and then his name was changed to that of Satan and Devil, by which he is ever since known. Satan declared he could cause all men to curse Jehovah God, and therefore he challenged God to put men on earth who would remain faithful and steadfastly devoted to God under the most severe test. That challenge raised the question before all creation: Who is supreme, Satan or Jehovah God? In order to give Satan the opportunity to prove his boastful challenge God accepted that challenge and has permitted the Devil to do all within his power to carry out his threat. At the same time Jehovah promised that in His due time He would send to earth His beloved Son Jesus as the Redeemer, Deliverer and King and that He should become the Ruler of the world, oust Satan, destroy his power, and establish a government of righteousness for the benefit of the people that all might know Jehovah is the Almighty God. In 1914 that due time of waiting came to an end, and God immediately installed Christ Jesus as the King of the world. There followed a war in heaven between Christ Jesus and the Devil, resulting in ousting the Devil from heaven and the casting of him to the earth. Although invisible to human eyes, Satan and his hordes have continued to operate amongst rulers and the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan the Devil pushed the nations of the world into the great war for the very purpose of causing their destruction rather than to see any man serve God. That war would have gone on until the race was entirely annihilated had not God stopped it. The great distress, perplexity and suffering now upon the rulers and upon the peoples of earth is directly chargeable to the Devil, and the Devil is using all his power to keep the people in ignorance of that truth. Jehovah God is in no wise responsible for the sorrows and troubles that now afflict you. Satan's purpose now is to turn the people away from God, and hence he causes them to suffer great woe, distress and perplexity; and his earthly representatives, particularly the clergy, tell the people that God is responsible for their sufferings, and those who believe such statements turn away from God. We are not left in doubt as to who is responsible for the world’s present woes. In Revelation, chapter twelve, appears the record concerning Satan’s being cast to earth, and then these words are added: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Revelation 12:12) As this scripture says, Satan knows that soon the great war is certain to be fought and that he has but a short time to prepare for it. For this reason Satan is now inducing the nations to make extensive preparations for war. In that war Satan purposes to destroy every creature that takes his stand on the side of Jehovah God and His King Christ Jesus. For that reason Satan induces his representatives on the earth to violently oppose every effort to bring to the people a knowledge of the truth. Without doubt many of these opposers are blind to the truth themselves; but they are serving Satan, notwithstanding that ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah caused the World War to stop in 1918 for the express purpose of affording an opportunity for the people to hear the truth of and concerning Him and His kingdom. If anyone doubts this statement, read the words of Jesus recorded in Matthew 24:14,21,22. Since then God has sent forth His witnesses to give the peoples of earth the needed information concerning the cause of the trouble and what will be the result; and for that reason not only has Satan used his earthly agents to hinder these witnesses of Jehovah, but he would destroy every one of them except for the protection given them by the Lord. While Jehovah’s witnesses are declaring in the earth the truth of and concerning Jehovah and His kingdom and His day of vengeance, the preparation for the great war continues and the battle draws nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Up to the present time Jehovah God has not taken a hand in the troubles that are afflicting the peoples of the world. His time to fight, as stated by Him, is at the battle of Armageddon, otherwise called in the Scriptures the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. The reason for that great battle is this: Jehovah’s time has come to set up among men on earth His righteous government; and this He does in fulfilment of His promise made long ago to establish on earth peace and good will toward men. That government of Jehovah under Christ will completely fulfil the fondest desire of every honest person. Before that happy condition can be brought about, however, the Devil and his power and influence must be completely destroyed; and that means the destruction of his entire organization. The people must be free to serve God in righteousness and without interference, and this can be done only after Satan’s rule has come to a complete end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the time of the rebellion in Eden till now Satan the Devil has been the invisible ruler of this world, and that wicked rule must end before peace and righteousness can come to stay. Everybody knows that the visible rulers of this world are men who are very imperfect. Today money is the great power amongst the nations; hence the commercial element is the strongest and exercises the greatest influence over the other ruling factors. The political rulers find that they must yield to the influence of the commercial interests. Has anyone a doubt that the clergy are engaged in the politics of this wicked world? You all know that the clergy participate in the political affairs of this world, and therefore they constitute a part of the world. Catholics, Protestants and Jews now unite in an effort, as they announce, to bring peace and prosperity to the world and, according to their own declaration, they utterly ignore Jehovah God and His Kingdom and substitute therefor their own means of accomplishing that purpose. They call upon the name of God but entirely disregard His Word and His kingdom. Even though the rulers set fixed days to pray to be heard of men, God will not grant their prayers. The three ruling elements of the world are: commercial, political and religious. We know that this world is very unrighteous; therefore it could not be God’s world, and we could not expect God to bless it. It is just exactly as Jesus and the apostles said, that the Devil is the invisible ruler and he blinds the visible rulers and the peoples to the truth.—John 12:31; 14:30; 2 Corinthians 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the clergy represented Jehovah God and His kingdom they would refuse to have anything to do with Satan’s world, but would hold before the people the truth of and concerning God's kingdom and would show the people that God’s kingdom is their only means of relief. When the League of Nations was brought forth the clergy endorsed it, and have likewise endorsed every peace pact made since then as a means of recovering the nations of the world. The Scriptures say, at Romans 6: 1G: ‘Ye are the servants of him whom ye serve.’ It is easy for you to determine, then, whom they serve. The clergymen are friends of this world, because they are a part of it; and hence according to the Scriptures and the facts they serve the Devil and not God and Christ Jesus, and this is proved by the following scriptures: “The friendship of the world is enmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (James 4:4; John 8:44) Y’ou will observe that I am not slandering or abusing the clergy, but merely stating the facts which you know to exist and citing the inspired words of the Lord in explanation of those facts. My only purpose in making mention of the clergy in this connection is that the people may see the truth and not be misled into Satan's trap. Because Jehovah’s witnesses are wholly devoted to God’s kingdom under Christ, the agents of Satan oppose the message or testimony of Jehovah which these witnesses bring to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great war is now rapidly approaching. At Revelation, chapter sixteen, it is written that Satan is gathering all nations to Armageddon to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and that war will involve the whole world, and especially will involve the nations known as “Christendom”. “Christendom” will suffer the greatest calamities and loss, as the Scriptures plainly state. The reason that the war is called “'Armageddon” is this: “Armageddon” means ‘the place of assembly of Jehovah’s troops’. Jehovah God has assembled the true followers of Christ Jesus and brought them into His organization, as shown by Revelation, the fourteenth chapter. Christ Jesus is Jehovah's chief executive officer, and His great war field marshal. Jerusalem is a symbolic name given to Jehovah God’s organization. In Zechariah 14: 2 Jehovah says: “I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle.” That means that Jehovah assembles His own forces under Christ, and by His skillful maneuvering He compels Satan to bring his army up against God’s organization, and hence God forces the fight at Armageddon. Satan the Devil is causing the nations of the earth to prepare for war for that very reason, and Satan is setting them all against God and His kingdom; and for this reason you observe that the world continues to increase in oppression, wickedness and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When these mighty contending forces are fully in battle array, then Jehovah God will begin the war, the leadership of His forces being under Christ Jesus. In Zechariah 14: 3 it is written : “Then shall [Jehovah] go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the [days of old].” That means what it says, that Jehovah God with His great and invincible army will fight against all the nations in Satan’s organization, and which oppose Jehovah God; and that includes all the nations of “Christendom”. It is in the land called “Christendom” where the chief opposition is made to prevent the people from hearing God's Word of truth. In Canada, which is a part of “Christendom”, men holding high official positions have prevented the people of that land from hearing God's message by radio. You well know that in doing this such men have not acted in behalf of Jehovah God and His kingdom, but do act in behalf of God’s enemies. I will not dignify the head man of that Commission by making mention of his name. He has not injured and cannot injure me, because the message which I deliver is not mine. He is fighting against God. A free people, capable of determining what they may hear, have been deprived of their just rights to hear what they need in this hour of great distress; and, above all, Jehovah God has been defied and His Word and Name defamed by that self-constituted censor residing in Canada. Jehovah God will duly recompense that wicked man and his wicked associates and advisers. He admits that the clergymen are his advisers and that these men are pastors and shepherds of various religious congregations. That man and his associates constitute the principal ones of the clergymen’s flocks. The fate of such men Jehovah God has announced, and I will call your attention to that fate in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would therefore be out of place for me to indulge in vituperative language against him or against any other man. Vengeance is Jehovah’s, and He will execute His judgment against His enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In days of old, as the Scriptures and facts show, Jehovah God fought against the nations that opposed Him and that oppressed His covenant people. At the battle of Gibeon Jehovah threw down great chunks of ice from the heavens and slew a multitude of the enemy, and He made the sun and the moon to stand still while Joshua finished the slaying job. There He fought for His people, and He will fight for them again at Armageddon.—Joshua 10:10-13; Isaiah 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jabin and Sisera attacked God’s covenant people under Barak, God caused the flood of the rivers to sweep aivay multitudes of the enemy, and the powers of heaven destroyed them in that war. (Judges 4 and 5; Psalm 83: 9) When Sennacherib brought his army before Jerusalem and defied Jehovah God, 185,000 of his soldiers instantly died. These ancient wars are recorded in the Bible, as stated at 1 Corinthians 10:11, as mere samples showing w’hat shall come to pass upon the nations of “Christendom” that oppose Jehovah and gather together against God’s organization at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great battle of the day of God Almighty, as compared with others, will cause all other wars to appear as small or tame affairs. Concerning that war at Armageddon it is written, in Jeremiah, chapter 25: “[Jehovah] hath a controversy with the nations; he will give them that are wicked to the sword.” (Jeremiah 25: 31) Continuing to describe this coming battle of Armageddon, God’s prophet Jeremiah says: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind [of trouble] shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the othei’ end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.” (Jeremiah 25:32-35) Thus the Lord definitely states that the shepherds and pastors, and the principal of their flocks, and the censors that now oppose His message and His kingdom, shall fall and find no way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By His prophet Ezekiel Jehovah declares that the armies of the world shall fall by sword, by famine and by pestilence. (Ezekiel 6:11) Further describing the terrible slaughter and the means of destruction, Jehovah God by His prophet Zechariah says: “And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem [Jehovah’s organization]; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.”—Zechariah 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In further proof that Armageddon will be the greatest war and most terrible slaughter ever known to man, Jesus says: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.”—Matthew 24:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are now merely calling attention to the fact that Jehovah is the great God, and Christ Jesus is King; and these witnesses are endeavoring to comfort the people of the world by bringing to them a knowledge of God’s purpose of relief and protection for those who take their stand on His side. Jehovah’s witnesses are giving this information to you in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment. Now these witnesses are hastening through the land and amidst great opposition and at much cost and inconvenience to themselves, in order to bring to you the message of the Kingdom. They are not complaining, but, on the contrary, are rejoicing and giving thanks to God for this privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ESCAPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the twenty-first Psalm it is written that Jehovah God will find out all His enemies and shall destroy them at Armageddon and none shall escape. Are you an enemy of God or are you His friend? The scripture is plain in these w<sup>r</sup>ords: “A friend of the world is the enemy of God.’ (James 4:4) No nation or government of this w’orld is a friend of Jehovah God. The only way to become God’s friend is to take a stand on His side and for His kingdom under Christ. Satan's world has come to an end, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the people must be either for Satan or for Jehovah and His kingdom. The time has come when all persons must now make their choice. Pharaoh, the ruler of the first world power, defied Jehovah God, and his organization was destroyed. Other rulers and public officials now on the earth have defied Jehovah God and have refused to hear His message, and prevent others from hearing; and God declares that as His enemies they shall meet a like fate. Men in public office may publicly speak Jehovah's name and call upon Him to sustain them, but their call will be in vain, because he who now serves God must do so in spirit and in truth. There can now be no compromise by serving this world and asking Jehovah’s help, because the time is here to vindicate Jehovah’s name by destroying Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few men may control all the money of this world and all the offices and exercise all the power of government, but these things will avail them nothing at Armageddon. These rulers have allied themselves with the shepherds or pastors of hypocritical religion; and as long as they do this, Jehovah declares that they are His enemies and shall find no way of escape. Before they could find a way of escape they must separate themselves from hypocritical religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, is the way of escape from destruction in this great war just ahead? Man’s answer to that question would amount to nothing, but God’s answer is true and certain. In Zephaniah, chapter two, Jehovah God answers that question and tells the people who become His friends what is the only way of escape. To all such He says: ‘Gather yourselves together, 0 ye nations [peoples] not desired.’ Who are such that are not desired by the rulers of this world? All those who are opposed to Satan’s oppressive and wicked rule and who love Jehovah God and righteousness and desire to see His government of righteousness established. There are millions of such good people in the land. Further quoting from that same scripture: Jehovah says: “Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; ... it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The meek are those who are teachable. No one can be taught without hearing facts; and in some parts of the seventh world power the people are prevented from hearing the truth by radio. But I am going to tell you in a moment of God's provision for even them to hear. All persons in &quot;Christendom” must now shortly take their stand either for or against Jehovah God's kingdom, and all who escape and are brought through that great war and live must seek the truth, take a firm stand on Jehovah’s side, and do what is right. How can I seek the Lord, you ask? By putting your trust in Jehovah as the only true God, and in Christ Jesus as the Redeemer, Savior and King of the world, and no longer trust to any worldly institution; then study God’s Word of truth, and the explanation which He has graciously provided, and learn what provisions Jehovah has made to bring peace, prosperity and everlasting life to those who serve Him. To make an honest endeavor to learn what God’s purpose is, as set forth in the Bible, is the proper way to seek meekness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How may I seek righteousness? God’s ways are always right. (Psalm 19: 7-10; 119: 75) He declares that His Word, the Bible, is the guide to the feet of everyone who wants to walk in righteousness. (Psalm 119:105) You must have a knowledge of what is in His Word. To enable you to get such knowledge Jehovah has brought about the fulfilment of His prophecies and caused these facts to be published, and now He sends forth His witnesses to tell you how and where to find these truths. These witnesses bring to you Jehovah’s message, and not the message of any man. Learn what is right and then do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is required of those who please Jehovah? That question Jehovah by His prophet answers, in Micah 6:8, saying: ‘Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly [that is, obediently] with thy God.’ That means to render justice to all and do injustice to none. Love mercy and be merciful toward others and, above all, obey Jehovah God, and not man. When you gain this knowledge you must not keep it to yourselves solely, but must tell others about Jehovah and His lungdom for the blessing of mankind and thus show your love for God and for your fellow man. If men command you that you shall not hear the gospel of the Kingdom, and shall not tell others about it, give no heed to their commands ; but, on the contrary, obey God and firmly stand for Him and His kingdom of righteousness. Such was the course taken by the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Acts 4:19; 5: 29) You must do no violence to any person. All punishment that is to be administered God will administer it in His own good way. What shall he the reward of those who follow this rightful course in this time of groat stress? Jehovah answers: ’You may he hid in that day of the Lord's anger.’ The only possible way of escape from the terrible war that is coming upon the nations is by becoming God’s friend and having Him for your friend, and then obeying God and following in His righteous way. Acknowledge Him and His King, Christ Jesus, and put yourself under His protection ; that is the way, and only way, of escape and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries the people have given heed to the teachings and schemes of man. All these schemes and plans of men have failed, and the result is that today “all the foundations of the [world] are out of course”. (Psalm 82: 5) Why longer stand in peril ? Why listen to the words of blind guides?. Those who remain with Satan’s organization will die in the great battle of Armageddon. Only those who positively put themselves under the protection of Jehovah and His kingdom will live. For centuries Jehovah has permitted Satan to carry on his wickedness, and now it is due time for Jehovah to act against him. The day of reckoning has come, and Jehovah will show all creation that He is the Supreme One and the One from whom all blessings flow; and to this end He will express His anger by destroying Satan’s organization, including all those nations that now rule the people and oppose God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But how may we know that the time has come for the expression of Jehovah’s anger and that Armageddon is near ? That question I will answer from the prophecy of the Scriptures. Prophecy can be understood by men only after its fulfilment has begun. The end of Satan’s world came in 1914, which Jesus prophesied would be marked by the great war amongst the nations. Such war was to be quickly followed by famine, pestilence and earthquakes, according to Jesus’ prophecy. All these things have been fulfilled. Furthermore He prophesied that the nations would then be in great distress and perplexity, men’s hearts failing them for fear of what is coming. (Luke 21:10-26) That is exactly the condition that you see in the land today. The evidence is therefore conclusive. The people in the midst of an abundance are suffering want, and in no nation is human way of relief found. The people cry unto Jehovah, and He says to them, in Zephaniah 3:8: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” The nations of “Christendom&quot; are iioav united against Jehovah’s kingdom and are therefore ‘gathered together’, and all these ruling powers oppose Jehovah and His kingdom and witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this connection the Lord gave commandment, in these words: ‘This gospel of the kingdom shall now be preached to all the world as a witness to the nations, and then the end shall come in a time of trouble such as the world has never known.’ (Matthew 24:14, 21, 22) The very purpose of the proclamation of this message by Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to the commandment of the Lord is that the testimony and warning to the rulers may be given that they may have no excuse for their wrongful course, and that the people may have an opportunity to believe and obey God and escape the terrible drubbing that will shortly come upon “Christendom”. As soon as that witness work is completed the war will begin. Already the testimony has gone to every nation of “Christendom”, and to that end more than 140 millions of books containing the message are now in the hands of the people; all of which has been done amidst great opposition. When we know that this message of Jehovah’s kingdom is not given to build up a worldly organization, nor to obtain members, nor to collect money from the people, then why should there be such opposition to it? The answer is, Satan the enemy of God and of man is trying to keep the people in the dark that he may destroy them all. Those who hear and obey the truth will escape, and no others will escape. The prophecies and all the facts show that the Avar is in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only does Canada seek to keep the people from hearing the truth of God’s kingdom, but also the tAvo great radio corporations, owned and operated by Big Business in America, do all they can to prevent the people from hearing the message of the Kingdom; but they cannot succeed. Even if every radio station on earth refuses to broadcast the Kingdom message God will get it to the people Avho desire to hear it. Machines are now made and widely distributed in America and other countries by which the message is given to the people in an amplified form. The speech that I am now making is being electrically recorded and will be available for the peoples all over “Christendom” to hear. Furthermore, this address will be published and distributed by the millions. Anyone desiring a copy needs only to ask for it. The truth is Jehovah’s and shall now prevail in the face of all opposition which the enemy may hurl against it. Satan is now making his last stand because he knows that soon he must fight the Lord's army. His representatives on earth are striving to concentrate the wealth of the world in their own hands, that the people may be serfs and be compelled to do their bidding. The farm lands are rapidly passing from the sons of toil into the hands of gigantic corporations. The highways are crowded with men who want to work but who are forced to tramp from place to place; and all of these are crying out in their distress, and their cries have reached the ears of Jehovah of hosts, and He declares He will smite their oppressors.—James 5:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few men may shortly control all the visible wealth of the land, but their treasures shall avail them nothing. Satan’s world has ended and must go down. The invincible army of Jehovah is now assembled. The strength of that army cannot be seen by human eyes. The visible part of it is insignificant, because made up of a small company of men and women wholly devoted to God. In themselves they are weak, but in the Lord they are strong, and blessed is their lot. You, my brethren, are assembled on Mount Zion under the leadership of Christ the great Conqueror. It is your blessed privilege now to sing the praises of Jehovah as you march to the war. With understanding and boundless joy continue to proclaim the testimony of Jehovah God and His kingdom, which is your only part in the war, and then watch the Almighty Hand smite the enemy to the dust! Let your battle song be, “The sword of Jehovah and His glorious King.” The forces of the enemy shall not beat you down, because the everlasting arms of Jehovah are bearing you up. Faithfully and unfalteringly now, pursue your work, and you shall see the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Slack not your hand, but lift high the banner of Jehovah’s kingdom that the people may see the way to go, that they may take their stand on the side of the Almighty God and find the only way of certain escape. Let the people know that blessed is the man who has the faith and courage to place himself unreservedly under the protection of the Almighty God “whose name alone is Jehovah”. He will cleanse the earth of all unrighteousness and make it a fit and blessed place for the people to live forever in peace, health and prosperity, while they continually sing the praises of Him who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclamation of “The Way of Escape”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">FITTING climax to the distribution of millions of copies of Judge Rutherford’s booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> was the address Sunday evening, April 16, broadcast on 46 stations, and reproduced in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the nine days ending on April 16 a special effort was under way to tell as many as could be reached that the great crisis is upon the world, that the cause is discernible, that all human efforts to pull the nations out of perplexity and distress have failed and will continue to fail; that there is but one sure and complete remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font6"> booklet tells what that remedy is, and so does Judge Rutherford’s lecture on “The Way of Escape”, which you have enjoyed in the foregoing pages. The booklet and the lecture announcement were put out together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font6"> booklet and this lecture on “The Way of Escape” tell us about the great war that is impending, the last war, the war that will really end all wars, the war when Jehovah “rises up to the prey<sup>5</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should anybody want to stop the proclamation of a way of escape from the greatest, most stupendous danger that has ever hung over the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely nobody but the Devil and those that have the Devil’s spirit would try to stand in the way of Jehovah’s chariot </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There may have been a shadow of excuse in the past. There may have been some mental confusion, traceable to Satan’s putting of black for white and white for black. He seeks always to prevent the spread of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But with the abject failure of the League of Nations now accomplished, which failure has been forecast for years by Judge Rutherford, and with the failure of each and every international conference, why cannot even the blindest see that it is no mere accident that 140,000,000 copies of this man’s books are in the hands of the people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the object of the books were to get anybody into anything it would be different, but it is apparent to every reader of any one of them that the whole object is to put Jehovah God in His rightful place in the heart of the people, and to help them find a place in His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This Thanksgiving Proclamation of “The Way of Escape” went over a chain of stations covering all that portion of the United States and Canada east of the Rocky mountains. Telegrams show excellent reception everywhere in Canada, and there are things in that lecture to make every Canadian wince. There is no way of keeping the truth out of Canada or any other country; for it is God’s truth, not man's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the day of the lecture, and the day preceding, there was a great witness in Washington, D.C. All the principal officeholders, from the president down, received the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font6"> booklet, and in his case and in most cases with expressions of appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How ridiculous of the clergy in Canada, New Jersey or elsewhere to think they can accomplish anything by oppositions and persecutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much interest was aroused by the announcement that Judge Rutherford will speak over another large chain of stations at 10.00 a.m., Sunday, April 23, on the topic ■'Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity&quot;. It is bound to be good.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In Defense of the Bees </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By H. E. Coffey (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font6">AVING just read your treatise on insects, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Aye</span><span class="font6"> No. 340, I feel the urge to call attention to what I honestly believe is an error in opinion, on page 808. You mention a grape grower who claims bees eat his grapes, and you state that bees, as well as yellow jackets, know how to puncture the skins of grapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have no motive in calling attention to what I believe is an error other than that I dislike to see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Aye</span><span class="font6"> publish untruth. I have been closely associated with bees for a number of years and know their habits and have observed them about fruit. I honestly do not believe a bee can puncture the skin of a grape, or that they injure other fruit on which the skin of the fruit is uninjured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Back in 1899, at Amity, N. Y., trouble arose between two brothers named Utter. One was a beekeeper, the other a fruit grower. The latter averred that the former’s bees punctured his peaches, and, in consequence of the alleged damage, he claimed he was unable to raise any fruit. The fruit grower brought suit against the beekeeper, and the case was tried on December 17, 18, and 19, 1899, at Goshen. There was no lack of legal talent on either side. The case was hard-fought. Some thirty witnesses were examined, among them Frank Benton, then of the United States department of agriculture. Benton testified that bees never puncture sound fruit; that it is impossible for them to do so, owing to the fact that they have no cutting jaws like those found in the wasp and other insects of that character. He also showed that wasps and birds will, under some conditions, puncture fruit; that these minute holes they make will, during a dearth of honey, be visited by bees. Other expert testimony was offered, nearly all of which exonerated the bees. The jury, in this ease, returned a verdict for the defendant, and it is the only case I know of pertaining to this question that ever was tried in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For over fifty years Mr. A. I. Root and his son, Ernest, had an apiary of over three hundred colonies located in their vineyard at Medina, Ohio, and produced hundreds of pounds of grapes every year. Some of the bunches would hang within a few inches of the entrances of the beehives, but no sound grapes were ever observed to have been injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, some years ago a neighbor sent word to Mr. Ernest Root that he would like to have him come to his vineyard, that he would give him indisputable proof that his bees were actually puncturing his (the neighbor’s) grapes and sucking out the juice. These men looked over the luscious bunches of grapes and, sure enough, found small, needle-like holes in almost every grape that the bees were working on. It looked as if the bees were “caught in the act”. Mr. Root, for the first time, could not offer a satisfactory explanation to clear his bees. He sent word to an old farmer who had been a beekeeper for years, explaining what they had found. The farmer was a close observer. One morning he sent word that he had found the culprit and if Mr. Root would come down early some morning he would point him out. This he did, and was shown a little bird, quick of flight, about the size of a sparrow, striped, and called the Cape May warbler </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Dendroica tigrina). </span><span class="font6">This bird has a sharp, needle-like beak. It would alight on a bunch of grapes and almost as fast as one can count would puncture grape after grape. After his birdship had done his mischief he would leave; then would come the innocent bees during the later hours of the day and finish the work of destruction by sucking the juices of the grapes that had been punctured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many other species of small birds besides the Cape May warbler learn this habit of puncturing grapes, among them the ever present sparrow and the beautiful Baltimore oriole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago Prof. N. W. McLain, while employed by the United States department of agriculture, conducted an elaborate series of experiments to determine whether or not bees injure sound fruit. He placed sound fruit consisting of grapes, peaches, apricots, etc., in hives containing bees that had been brought to the verge of starvation. This fruit was left in the hives day after day, and was never once molested. He then tried breaking the skin of the fruit, and in every case all specimens with broken skins were attacked by the bees and the juices sucked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Afterward Prof. H. A. Surface, at that time economic zoologist at Harrisburg, Pa., tried a similar experiment, but in no case did the bees attack sound fruit, although they partook freely of that which had the skins broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was exhibited at the Wilmington (Del.) State Fair, held in Sept., 1908, a three-story observation hive having two stories filled with combs and bees. The third story had hung in it a peach, a pear, and a bunch of grapes. The owner of the hive, Mr. Joel Gilfillan, of Newark, kept this hive on exhibition during the entire fair, and the fruit was never once touched by the bees nor injured by them in any way. The hive had glass sides, through which the bees and the fruit could be plainly seen. Photographs were made of the hive, and are still accessible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much additional proof could be submitted to show that your grape grower informer is mistaken in his observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Careful study of the mouth parts of a bee would convince one that bees are not guilty of eating grapes. They only suck the juices of damaged grapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">An Odd Case at Galena</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[From the Galena (Hl.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font6">ROBABLY one of the most happy families of today is the Zimmerman family. Miss Ethel Zimmerman, their daughter, suffered a severe attack of illness; then something went wrong—she discovered that things grew black before her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This followed a severe attack of sore throat and enlarged tonsils, and severe headaches. Soon the vision of the left eye was gone entirely. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Zimmerman, of Scales Mound, became alarmed and took her to the specialists, who diagnosed her case as tumor on the brain. X-ray pictures also revealed the same. They also said that an operation was her only salvation. For prognosis they offered one chance in a million for recovery. She was then taken to a hospital, where two more specialists found the same diagnosis, and they were advised to take her to Chicago for the operation by a specialist there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. and Airs. Zimmerman were grieved to the fullest extent and were advised by friends to take her to their local chiropractor, Frank M. Norman, D.C., of Galena. This they did as a last recourse, and Dr. Norman advised them to see their doctor in Chicago, that they might be satisfied before starting adjustments. While in Chicago, Mr. and Airs. Zimmerman took their daughter to the office of one of the leading chiropractors, who had been with the Palmer School faculty and clinic work for fourteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He cheerfully sent them back to Dr. Norman, saying that he had one of the best equipped offices in the state, also complete X-ray equipment, and had to his credit many hard and difficult cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon arrival at Dr. Norman’s office a complete X-ray picture of the spine was taken and in this manner a large nail was located in the lumbar region of the spine, near the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, but not in the spine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Norman then registered all of the spinal nerves for nerve pressure with the highly sensitive instrument, the Neurocalometer, and found high registers of twenty points opposite the atlas and axis vertebrae, near the skull and brain. This was due to the inflammation on the meninges of the brain and spinal cord, by nerves’ being pressed upon by misaligned vertebrae at those places. High registers were also found in the cervical and brachial enlargement of the spine and in the Imnbar region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the first adjustment Aliss Zimmerman was feeling better, and after the third adjustment, no longer had to be led around. After the fifth adjustment she closed her good eye and threaded a needle with the eye she had so recently lost the vision of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alany people from far and near have seen the pictures at Dr. Norman’s office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Afiss Zimmerman made wonderful progress, getting along very nicely. The last X-ray picture that was taken by Dr. Norman showed the nail in the bottom of the pelvis, as low as it could possibly get without passing. About two weeks later Aliss Zimmerman was taken to The Palmer School and was thoroughly examined by the dean of the school, Dr. A. B. Hender, AI.D., D.C., Ph.C., who is also a surgeon on the operating staff at the Davenport hospitals. Traces of where the nail was were found, but not the nail. Two more X-ray pictures were taken, but did not show the nail. It had passed unknown to Aliss Zimmerman, and without doing damage to the tissues of where it had been lodged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Treat the “Flu” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Frank McCoy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(From the Vancouver </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">NFLUENZA is also called la grippe and catarrhal fever. This disease is very contagious and, if many cases occur in your community, it is wise to avoid overcrowded and heated rooms. It is important to obtain plenty of sleep so that you do not become tired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Influenza is characterized by many symptoms of a severe cold. The main danger lies in the fact that at the start of the attack it is difficult to tell whether the patient has a mild form which is not especially harmful or whether he has one of the serious forms which may be fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes influenza becomes complicated with pneumonia, a particularly bad combination. “Flu” is usually followed by extreme weakness and depression which lasts long after the attack is over. One attack does not prevent future attacks; in fact the patient seems to be more susceptible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are three main forms, with slightly different symptoms, although all of them are characterized by abnormal weakness and exhaustion. The general symptoms follow an incubation period of two to four days. Then the patient is suddenly ill with dizziness, aching all over the body, fever, coated tongue, perhaps nausea, a blinding headache, pains in the eyes, chills, nervousness, depression and broken sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the respiratory form there is a running at the nose, sneezing, sore throat, tonsilitis, enlarged neck glands, and a hard cough which does not seem to raise anything, the cough being worse at night. In a few days the chest is tender, breathing difficult, and a thick mucous is raised by coughing. There is a rapid heart beat and a fever ranging from 100 to 105 degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the nervous form the ‘cold’ symptoms may be absent, but a headache is present, together with pain and aching through the back, and the nervous depletion is extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the digestive form, in addition to the fever there may be intense nausea, vomiting, pains in the abdomen, and diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TREATMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you feel the first symptoms of influenza which I have described, do not delay in going home and going to bed. If you are working do not try to keep on and finish your day’s work, because most of the deaths from influenza are due to neglect in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first thing to do is to use an enema of two quarts of warm water and thoroughly cleanse the bowels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next, take a hot tub bath, lying in •water as hot as can be borne for about twenty minutes. The temperature should be about from 104 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the bath dry quickly and wrap yourself in some heavy woolen blankets, then lie down in bed and have somebody else place plenty of covers on top and a hot water bottle at your feet. You will need some assistance, because you must not uncover yourself once you begin to sweat. [If, in the emergency, only one or two blankets are available, spread two or three layers of newspaper sheets between the blankets, or between blanket and bedsheet covering the body. This light but warm and inexpensive covering will quickly induce sweating.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Drink a glass of hot water every thirty minutes as long as you are awake. You will soon begin to sweat, and will continue to do so until your fever has disappeared. If the head becomes congested apply a cold compress to the forehead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This sweating treatment should be continued for several hours, then the patient should take a tepid bath and return to bed between clean clothing. If the fever continues, an occasional short, cool shower may be used, followed by a brisk rubdown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Repeat this sweating treatment every day for the first two or three days. One enema should be used morning and evening, using a bedpan if necessary, as the patient should not be exposed too long to the cold air. The patient should not be given food of any kind except water, which may be flavored with lemon or orange juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The patient should not under any circumstances attempt to go out, or return to work, until he has entirely recovered. Once your temperature has become normal and your appetite has returned you may start eating any kind of food in proper combinations. However, you very likely will not feel hungry for several days, and it is advisable to use only plenty of water and acid fruit juices during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The theory that the body requires nourishing food during an acute attack of influenza is very wrong and has probably resulted in many deaths which could have been prevented by the methods I have just outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Priest Tries to Imitate His Father </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Virgilio Ferguson (Portugal)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">O GIVE you an idea of the domineering and intolerant attitude of the Catholic clergy in Portugal, and how they try to prevent the people from reading the Bible, am sending you the translation of an article published lately by the principal Catholic paper, called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Novida-des</span><span class="font6"> (News).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the Portuguese Industrial Exposition the “British &amp;&nbsp;Foreign Bible Society”, which has maintained an agency in Lisboa for many years, applied and obtained license from the authorities to open a small stand on the exposition grounds to sell Bibles and New Testaments. After some time and having already sold over 2,000 Bibles the above-mentioned paper published the following article under the headline “Around the Portuguese Industrial Exposition” :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the different pavilions at the Exposition in the Park Edward VII, there is seen also a little shack of Portuguese industry for the propaganda of Protestant books, which pleasant and polite clerks place in the hands of any and every one at the most ridiculous prices. Nicely bound Bibles with gilt edges are sold at one escudo and even half escudo [about three cents American money; w’hich statement is false]. We do not protest, however, against such liberty manifested by these religious agents. Neither do we pity them: it is a business the same as any other. Yet we do feel pity for the uncultured, ignorant and silly blockheads, some with cravats and some without; some with a handkerchief on their heads or fine furs over their shoulders, who with frightful unconsciousness eagerly buy such pretty and cheap books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be impossible to see such a sight in any large city in the world! Are those who purchase those “pretty books” incredulous or only Protestants? No, the most of them are not. And this fact was proved by us during a few minutes we stopped near the stand some days ago, for every time we spoke to the many deceived persons, telling them that those books were Protestant, they would immediately return them or else cast them away with disgust, which caused some notice. Such procedure is onlj’- a simple manifestation of the lack of culture, the uneducated and undisciplined curiosity of our people. Such a sorrowful thing! So here is a warning to the imprudent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The strange part is that no one ever returned a Bible or cast one away at the exposition. And over the stand was written in large letters: “The Bible is neither Catholic nor Protestant.” And another notice stated that during the exposition in Paris 11,022 Bibles were sold. And although Jesus said, “Search the scriptures,” and Paul said, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,” yet the Catholics of Portugal consider anyone who purchases and reads a Bible a “silly blockhead”. So they brought more pressure to bear, until finally they succeeded in having the Bible stand removed from the exposition. But by then over 4,000 had been sold; and if it had remained until the end, no doubt more than 5,000 would have been sold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Isn’t That Grand?” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">LL readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> know that there are thousands, yea millions, of people all over the earth who are underfed, undernourished, and without the necessities of life. Almost heart-breaking are some of the conditions with which Jehovah’s witnesses come in contact as they go from house to house with the good news of the Kingdom in fulfilment of such scriptures as Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why are these people underfed? Why are they undernourished? Why are they without the necessities of life? Is it because the earth refuses to bring forth sufficient for the people who are on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In answer to these questions I cite the following from the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W. E. Pampling (England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fruit valued at more than a million francs (£11,000) was dumped into the Mediterranean today by Spanish growers who were unable to export it to France. The “quota system”, which has also restricted British exports to France, w<sup>r</sup>as responsible for the exclusion of the Spanish produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">£11,000 of fruit dumped into the sea while millions of people are underfed, undernourished and without the necessities of life! “Devilish” and “satanic” are the only words which come anywhere near describing a system under which such conditions are possible and obtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thanks be unto God that He long ago foreknew and foretold the oppressive conditions now existing as the result of the operation of Satan’s organization, the commercial element of which 463</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">is used to exploit, rob and oppress the people. How clearly this is brought to our attention in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font6"> Book Two. Every thinking man and woman should read Books One, Two and Three of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a joy to know that the time of relief for the people is here: the time when the products of earth, which Big Business has used to exploit the people to enrich themselves, God will take from them and give to the people who obey and serve Him; the time when the people, with these natural resources at their disposal, will glorify the name of their Creator, the Giver of every good and perfect gift! Then will be fulfilled that precious prophecy and promise found in Isaiah 23:18, a wonderful word. Concerning Tyre, which, as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font6"> Book Two so clearly points out, pictures the commercial element of Satan’s organization, we read: “And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to [Jehovah] : it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before [Jehovah], to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.’’ Isn’t that grand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Help from the Devil in Time of Need</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">F YOU are willing to sell yourself or your loved ones to the Devil, i.e., if you are willing to deny that Jehovah God </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font6"> and if you are willing to deny the Lord that bought you, and to lie to yourself and to others by ‘believing’ and repeating that “all is good; there is no evil” when you know perfectly well it is lying to do so, there is hardly anything in this life that you could want that you cannot get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From a lecture on “Christian Science” we select two paragraphs that illustrate the above. Unlike some, we doubt not the reliability of these illustrations. We believe that the ‘cures’ really took place, but were from the Devil, and therefore at what a price!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man who was sadly victimized by the tobacco liabit sought out a Christian Science practitioner. He announced that he “confined” himself to one hundred cigarettes a day but was fast becoming a mental and physical wreck. He told the practitioner that if Christian Science taught merely the use of the human will, he would not waste a moment with its treatment, for his power of resistance had completely gone. The practitioner explained that Christian Science treatment relies upon God-power and not human willpower. The practitioner gave him </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health </span><span class="font5">to read, while he closed his eyes in silent prayer. He looked up and said to his patient, “You do not want to smoke now, do you?” A look of positive bewilderment spread over the other ’s features. His lips moved, as if trying to bring back a taste that had departed. * ‘ Why, ’ ’ he said, ‘ ‘ do you know I haven’t the slightest desire for the stuff?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Christian Science practitioner had been called to see a little lad, who, to the physical senses, seemed desperately ill, with an extreme case of pneumonia. The mother, a faithful student of Christian Science, held the little unconscious figure in her arms. The practitioner joined her in her glorious prayer. The testimony of the senses reported serious disease, injustice, and an unthinkable God, whilst the Christianly scientific understanding of being, declared life to be deathless. After possibly four or five hours, the breathing seemed to grow a little less troubled, and the practitioner felt that he could leave. It was late in the afternoon before he was able to return to his little patient. When the door was flung open, in came the child on his little velocipede, his face beaming— well and free!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Disturbances in Cave of Machpelah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TXEXPLICABLE disturbances have occurred -L at the Cave of Machpelah, in Hebron, in which cave, according to the Scriptures, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Rebecca and Leah are buried. The site is covered by a mosque. Many historic relics have disappeared, including the grave stone which marked the burial place of Abraham. Fifteen rare carpets are missing. It is not too much to say that the Scriptures give reason to expect the resurrection of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob some time in the immediate future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Another “Holy Year” of La Bottega del Papa Part II</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(We continue our open letter to Achille Ambrogio Damiano Ratti [Achilles Ambrose Damian Ratti], the “pope”. We have elected to address him by the name Ambrose because it seems less formal, and more sociable-like.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Priests Trained in Blasphemy</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19330426_files/g_E_19330426-8.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">OUR men are trained in blasphemy which soars to infinite heights. The following is part of a “sermon”, not by the Devil, for he would be ashamed to utter such, but by “Reverend” Henry F. Hammer, in your St. Patrick's cathedral, New York, on the occasion of inducting 25 young men into the priesthood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of Christian art and culture is derived from the life of the priest. The most remarkable thing about the dignity and power of the priest is that he orders God, in his capacity as a man of the Lord, and God obeys him. If Clod Himself were to wander among us in a church [No danger!] He could do no more than the priest does in giving absolution to the penitent or in performing any of the acts of the mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it comes to lies, how about the feast of “Our Lady of the Snows”, when the virgin Mary sent a snowstorm on August 5, A.D. 352, and ordered a “church” built on the spot. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says, timidly, “Many learned theologians have attacked this purported miracle on the ground that it had no historical basis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of your assistant priests at a place in New Hampshire, at all masses on a given date, denounced as communistic propaganda Judge Rutherford's book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Hope of the World.</span><span class="font6"> He thus lied deliberately at every mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ambrose, you are in wrong. In your speech on the Mexican situation, published October 1, 1932, you said, “We were comforted by the world's admiration for the courage displayed by the clergy.” Apparently you do not know that “the friendship of the world is enmity with God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more you say, the deeper you get in wrong. Thus in the same address you so far forget yourself as to say of the Mexican people that “they ran the risk of first remaining apart from and then being entirely separated from the priesthood, and, in consequence, from the very sources of supernatural life”. 0 Ambrose!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Why Should You Be Bigoted?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">In a little while now you will be dead, and why should you disturb yourself unduly or disturb others, as you did in your address of February 16,1931, by references to what you termed “The Invasion by Protestantism” in the city of Rome ? You are reported to have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This is permitted to go on in such a way that even the Protestants themselves are astonished at the progress they are making. It is allowed to continue to such an extent that yesterday there was talk of a Protestant pilgrimage to Italy and today there is talk of holding a Protestant synod in Italy. It is allowed to go on till it even tries to acquire territory in Italy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Suppose it does; what of it? Can you not stand it to let somebody else have an opinion, as well as yourself? Your paper, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Osserva-tore Romano,</span><span class="font6"> refers to their teachings as “abominable propaganda”, “sewers of scandal and schism.” That is what yours is, Ambrose; so everything is nicely in balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your priest Thomas H. Martin, formerly of Colonial Beach, Va., and now of Winchester, Va., is a good and acceptable member of the Winchester Ministerial Association. All the other members are Protestants. Cardinal Gibbons referred to these Protestants as “separated brethren”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet in spite of the above admissions that you consider the Protestants as your brethren, in your encyclical issued January 10, 1928, you reiterated your claim that there is no safety outside of your church (which church is not mentioned in the Scriptures), and at Sydney your man Cerretti expressed the abhorrence felt by bishops and priests when they find Catholic men marrying Protestant women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Luke 12:10 Jesus said, “Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him,” but Article 8 of your treaty of conciliation with the Italian state provides that if anybody in Italy speaks of you in a derogatory manner he is liable to punishment. Looks as if you thought you were more important than Christ, Ambrose.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Mixed Up About Joseph</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, is not mentioned in the Scriptures after Jesus attained the age of twelve years, and Mary was most certainly a widow at the time of the crucifixion, inasmuch as Jesus made a home for her with the beloved disciple, John. Most certainly, therefore, Joseph could not have been of the “church of the firstborn”, and is still quietly asleep in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">death, waiting the due time to come forth from the tomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet we notice that on March 19, 1930, you concluded with a “memorare” to “St. Joseph”, calling upon him to remember certain things. You could have spared your breath; for “the dead know not any thing”. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) When a man dies, “his sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.” (Job 14:21) “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.” (Psalm 115:17) When Joseph wakes up, if you are still living, you can tell him what you were trying to tell him in your “memorare”, and you can both laugh about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his address on the meaning of the rosary, at St. Patrick’s cathedral, New York, October 7, 1928, your man Reverend Francis A. Fadden said that “the chain and the beads, although inanimate things, are filled with the personality of Christ”. The Scriptures say nothing about rosaries or beads, but they do say that the Word of God is sufficient “that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works”. (2 Timothy 3:17) “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly” (Colossians 3:16), Ambrose, and you will get somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We notice that on September 19, 1930, in a cathedral at Naples, ‘the blood of St. Januarius boiled,’ and in 400 years nobody has caught on to the trick of how it is done. What sense is there to it, even if it were the truth? Who cares whether his blood boils or not ? For several centuries the supposed blood of the martyr Thomas a Becket was sold in England, and then afterward was proved to be a mixture of red ocher.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>“Keep Yourselves from Idols”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We noticed that when your library collapsed, you graciously allowed the rescuers to kiss your hands. Wasn’t that nice? Probably those who were willing to kiss your hands would have kissed other parts of your body with equal alacrity, if you had told them to do it. “Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.”— 1 John 5: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All orders from you must be accepted on bended knee. Ambrose, we could not use you around here at all; you are spoiled. When you visit a country you take precedence over its monarch or president. The day you come to America we are going out in country territory to work, so we won’t have to look at you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persons of military rank must halt within ten feet and salute till you pass. Trumpeters announce your appearance. You demand a salute of 50 guns, while our president gets but 21. One of your most famous Jesuit orators, Anton Stonner, of Vienna, was so sick of the whole humbug that, after preaching to packed houses all over Austria for fifteen years, he renounced the priesthood and is now retired to private life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The carefully arranged and spectacular worship of a piece of bread called the ‘adoration of the host’ is all idolatry, pure and simple, masquerading under the fiction of a worship of Christ the King. The priest creates and sacrifices his own victim, thus glorifying himself and dishonoring his Creator, who never authorized or sanctioned such proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a mission sermon at St. Peter’s Catholic church, Memphis, your man Reverend L. H. Martin said, “Nothing on earth can compare with the mass, because during its celebration Christ Himself comes down on the altar to continue his work of redemption.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do you not know that Christ died </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“once</span><span class="font6"> for all”? Have you never read the scripture which says, “Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him” ?—Romans 6:9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>The Human Idols All Like It</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When you put on your show at Sydney, the “faithful” filed past Cerretti 10 to 12 deep for more than an hour. Every now and then some child would evade the ushers and run and kiss his ring. It is said that he beamed on them. Why not ? They were making an idol out of him, and that was what he liked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of Cardinal Lauri at the show at Dublin we read: “Papal chamberlains walked alongside him, dressed in black knee breeches with medieval ruffs around their necks. Bishops in purple knelt as the procession passed down the aisles.” More idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Outside, “Hundreds knelt on dusty sidewalks listening to the legate’s benediction coming to them through loud-speakers. Hundreds more struggled to kiss his ring when he left the cathedral, and the sidewalks were black with the robes of priests from every corner of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cardinal Lauri was your “messenger”, your “angel&quot;; for that is what </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">angelus</span><span class="font6"> means. Listen: “Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility and worshipping of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">angels,</span><span class="font6"> intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.” —Colossians 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the same poor piece of mere human flesh passed through London, June 19, 1932, ‘’Men and women dropped on their knees as the cardinal left the ‘royal’ car, his round rosy face beaming with pleasure. They stretched their hands to touch his robe or ring and hundreds held rosaries for him to bless. . . . When the legate arrived at Chester to spend the night thousands knelt in the square outside his hotel singing hymns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Dublin families pawned furniture to buy bunting; they went without food to have their rooms decorated. One woman sold her bed and slept on the floor in order that her window might have a shrine. When Lauri arrived he was met by military airplanes flying in the form of a cross and was greeted by a salvo of guns and a military guard of honor. People fell on their knees imploring his blessing, striving to kiss his hand or ring. All this was idolatry, pure and simple.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>“Thou Shalt Not Bow”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">In one place in Dublin two large shrines were built, each containing life-size figures of our Lord and the virgin Mary. Before these the people were expected to bow themselves and worship, and did so. Listen: “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. . . . Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.”—Exodus 20:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cardinal O’Connell’s gem of thought delivered at Dublin was reported in the press as follows: “We in America were misled by the vicious philosophy that anything was worth while as long as we could get away with it.” This appeared in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of June 23, 1932. How great the contrast between such an expression and the words of Jesus, ‘These are they that have received the word into good and honest hearts 1’—Luke 8:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You don’t seem to know what the Scriptures are for, Ambrose. In your encyclical of May 13, 1932, you advised the poor to “accept with humble and trustful heart from the hand of God the effects of poverty”. Why did you not encourage them to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”? Thus you could have comforted them in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your man the “Most Reverend” Leopoldo Ruiz y Flores, apostolic delegate to Mexico, in a radio address over WLWL on the night of November 17, 1932, said, “I have my confidence in the providence of God, who rules the world.” Y<sup>r</sup>ou should explain to him that “the god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4) is the Devil, whom he serves and whose he is. See John 12: 31 for more on this. Mr. Flores went on to say, “I trust in the help of Our Lady of Guadalupe.” That is the church that your men have taught the poor ignorant Mexicans to approach on their hands and knees. You ought to be ashamed of that, Ambrose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no record that Jesus or any of the. apostles went through rituals, none at all, but on October 16, 1932, your man Bishop John J. Dunn, in the lower church of St. Francis Xavier, New York city, spent a solid hour and a half consecrating a new altar. All this is idolatry, Ambrose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You have so mistrained your folks that the toe of the bronze statue of St. Peter in the cathedral at the Vatican has been actually kissed away by the millions on millions of foolish kisses that have been bestowed on this piece of metal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your man Mundelein makes mistakes, too. In a little folder entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vivat Jesu</span><span class="font6"> bearing his imprint he advises people to study the wounds of our Lord Jesus Christ, while Jesus himself told them to study the Word of Truth. And then the cardinal, in the same folder, says that at each word of the Chaplet of Mercy Jesus lets one drop of His blood fall on the soul of a sinner; several solid trainloads of blood every year. 0 Ambrose!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Respect for Courts (?)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Having your own courts, the Penitenzieri Apostolice and Supreme Tribunale della Segna-ture, we understand that where your clergy are involved you never recognize the jurisdiction of secular courts and the sentence of any civil court is considered as of no effect, no matter what its findings may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nevertheless, October 6, 1928, coincident with the opening of the fall term of the New York courts, some 250 to 300 justices and judges of the supreme court, the appellate court and the municipal court are alleged to have attended “the red mass”, especially for them, with Cardinal Hayes officiating. Now just why was that mass held? Was it to show that you control the courts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On his way back from Sydney, Cardinal Cer-retti came through New York, and there was a big church procession in his honor. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> issue of January 21, 1929, said: ‘'During the procession the canopy over the prelate was carried by Justice Morgan J. O’Brien, Judge Martin T. Manton, Judge Alfred J. Talley and Ovid de St. Aubin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatever your respect for the courts, you cannot have much for the elemental principle of justice, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Otherwise you would shut down on an arrangement which permits you and all the dignitaries of the church to live in highest luxury, and consents that a poor Dominican nun shall occupy a bare compartment in an unheated convent, and rise at midnight for services from September 14 to Easter Sunday. Why the invidious distinctions?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Why Be So Harsh?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">In your labor encyclical, broadcast May 17, 1931, you gave expression to the thought that ‘the differences in social conditions in the human family were wisely decreed by the Creator and must not and cannot ever be abolished’. If you honestly believe that, then it is no wonder you do not want God’s kingdom to come and God’s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. You would prefer that things would go on just as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Heywood Broun says (and we believe he is a Catholic too), “It seems a rather harsh concept to think of God as one who takes any joy in the breadlines as a permanent institution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What do you think, Ambrose, of this business of charging every evil to God, and then trafficking in justice? He is supposed to be sore at the sinners, and to intend to roast them a certain number of thousands of years, to get them well done, tender like, so they will be fit for heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But you, and your men, any time they wish to do it, can cut down that hot time in the old town of Purgatory by hundreds of days at a clip. Thus for some nice pole-vaulting stunts performed at the show in Dublin by a company of Boy Scouts, “an indulgence of 500 days was granted to each child.” (Yew York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> June 26, 1932)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can you honestly love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and honestly believe that Mary or somebody else has to plead with Him night and day eternally to do the decent, upright thing, and let poor penitents out of the flames? Do you not know that the Scriptures say, “Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out”?—John 6:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That you do not believe in the divine law of one and the same treatment for all offenders (Numbers 15:15,16), regardless of their station, is proved by the fact that in your canon law it is provided that convicted clergymen shall be imprisoned in places separate from those designated for laymen. Do you think that God does not see all that crookedness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dispatch from California states that at one time recently 87 of the convicts of San Quentin prison were taken into your church. The dispatch hastens to add that all these, by birth, education and training were really Catholics at heart; and all this we fully believe, without argument. Your church, with its appeals to all that is most unjust, is the best training school for the development of convicts that we could imagine.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>“Mind Not High Things”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Ambrose, did you ever read the scripture, “Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low’ estate”? (Romans 12:16) If you did you seem to have forgotten it. Else why do w<sup>r</sup>e see so much in the papers about your bestowing the order of the golden spur on King Fuad of Egypt, trembling and praying for King George of England, giving audience to the Mikado, expecting visits from King Victor Emmanuel of Italy, King Albert of Belgium, and the ex-kings Alfonso and Amanullah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You know that when King George was crow’iied he made the oath, “I am a faithful Protestant,” but you know<sup>7</sup> and others know<sup>7</sup> that he has decided leanings in your direction and you in his, like a couple of overcharged citizens each mistaking the other for a lamp-post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This idea that your men are of some unusual importance in the w<sup>T</sup>orld has spread to others. Instead of the humility which one w ould expect in so prominent a “light in the church”, Archbishop O'Connell made the demand, on his return in March, 1912, from Rome, where he had been given the red hat, that as a prince of the church, a cardinal, he was entitled to be saluted by the American ships and flag on his arrival in American waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven, but w’e noticed that some of those upon w’hom you have conferred the order of the Knight of Malta are James A. Farrell, president of the United States Steel Corporation; Morgan J. O’Brien, of the Supreme Court of New York; Cornelius F. Kelley, president of the Anaconda Copper Company ; Henry 0. Havemeyer, president of Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal; Frederick J. Fisher, vice president of General Motors Corporation ; George MacDonald, president of Nassau-Suffolk Lighting Company; John J. Bernet, president of Erie Railroad; Joseph J. Larkin, vice president of Equitable Trust Company; Thomas E. Murray, vice president of New York Edison Company; Joseph P. Grace, president of W. R. Grace Company, etc., etc. Maybe you did not know they were rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic Negroes do not like the Jim Crow policy of your “church”, but that does not worry us any, for it will all go to pieces soon, anyway. But there is no evidence that Christ or the apostles drew any color line, and you have kept Negroes from your higher schools of learning.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>How Peter Has Changed!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The British </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">United Free Press</span><span class="font6"> contains a dispatch from Rome from the first newspaper man that ever interviewed the pope. At the conclusion of the interview he says, “I therefore rose, knelt and kissed the ring, and the ‘holy father’ gave me his blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That interests us because Ambrose claims to be Peter brought up to date. Listen: “And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.” (Acts 10: 25, 26) Why did you not do that, Ambrose?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it comes to getting free publicity, Ambrose, you are certainly ‘the prince of the apostles’ and then some. July 9, 1929, when American naval men called to see you, you posed as Peter the fisherman’s successor. It helped to get your name into the paper once more. All is grist that comes to your mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that Peter was a fisherman has about as much to do with your job as the United States government has to do with the size of underwear worn by the crown prince of Siam. You always want to be in the spot light, literally and figuratively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an item from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font6"> of July 26, 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surrounded by his glittering, gorgeous court, and carried aloft on a platform resting on the shoulders of 12 crimson-clad attendants, his holiness performed the complete circuit of St. Peter’s square and then descended in front of St. Peter’s Basilica, where an altar had been erected, and imparted the apostolic benediction to the kneeling multitude. He was received with round upon round of applause, and with cries of * ‘ Long live the pope—king. ’ ’ The altar was illuminated in the twilight by a spot-light, which threw into bold relief the white-clad figure of Pope Pius XI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ladies and gentlemen, you will now witness the thrilling spectacle of Achille Ambrogio Damiano Ratti, the champion bareback rider of the world. Instead of tights, he has on a white robe. Instead of a horse, he has a throne on a platform. Instead of walking on his own feet, he is toted around by twelve crimson-clad suckers that worship him as another god on earth. Right this way! Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay! This, ladies and gentlemen, is the main three-ring performance in the main tent, the only one of its kind on earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>An Endless Publicity Palaver</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The stream of publicity that pours forth from the Vatican is endless. The same old items are hashed over and over and over again. “The event was signalized in the papal state by the flying of the pope’s flag, while the pontifical armed forces, the Swiss guards and the pontifical gendarmes wore their dress uniforms.” So says the press. What of it? What else w’ould they wear? And who cares? But it all helps to make a few more lines of free advertising. And that keeps the show alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“After luncheon and a siesta, the pontiff took an automobile ride in the Vatican gardens from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.,” says another dispatch. A man gets into an automobile and rides around his grounds, round and round and round. And the thing is so important that it has to be cabled across the oceans to the other side of the world. Oh, mamma! Buy me one!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or take this gem: “His sense of the dramatic w<sup>r</sup>as developed to a high degree,” telling how<sup>7</sup> he took a dig at the Russian situation. Well, he would not be of any good as a showman otherwise. Let the man alone. It is his way of making a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the way, about that automobile in which Ambrose rides round and round and round. It has a throne in it. The language of the dispatch is that it “contains a papal throne separated from tw<sup>T</sup>o seats in front for the pope’s personal attendants”. Of just what good a throne is in an auto, we don’t know’, but it helped get three inches of free advertising in the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font6"> and that is something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At all times we get a full line of publicity from Rome about what the pope intends to do, the suppositions and guesses and what not. It all helps to sell the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally there is a slip. March 27, 1932, your man Big Bill O’Connell, cardinal of Boston, amused the American people mightily. He made a grandiloquent introduction of the magnificent Vatican choir and there followed an indifferently performed piece of American jazz dance music, rendered in Rome by an Italian band and sent out by mistake all over the National Broadcasting Company’s hook-up, to the remotest ends of the country. Makes us think of the country newspaper that said, “Lard was rendered by the choir.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>“In Robes of Red and Gold”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">There is every reason to believe that the clothing of Christ and the apostles was that of the common people, simple and plain, and no reason why it should be otherwise. Jesus was not trying to overawe the people by dressing up like a monarch or a millionaire. But here are some extracts from the public press, of the way you and your men have dressed recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eight cardinals and a score of other high church dignitaries in robes of red and gold gathered in a stand beside the altar. The resident general of Tunisia, M. Manceron, and other French officials sat in the stand, their court uniforms, glittering with medals, making a brilliant picture. . . . The choir then sang the congress song, which was taken up by thousands of voices, while the papal legate slowly led the brilliant procession away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That was from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> May 12, 1930, account of the show at Carthage, and looks as if somebody, to say the least, has become “corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ”. (2 Corinthians 11:3) Here is one about the Dublin show, from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> of June 21, 1932:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An ecclesiastical procession, with a cavalry escort in blue and gold uniforms, then passed through the city between cheering lines of spectators, to the door of the cathedral where were massed the 29 bishops of Ireland. . . . The choir sang and the cardinal knelt. Again the choir sang and the cardinal walked up to the altar and kissed it. Then he went to the epistle corner </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">sang the prayer of the ‘immaculate conception’. After this he returned to the middle of the altar, gave a solemn blessing, and then retired to the archbishop’s palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your men could not go to Australia without “a chapel being erected on the main deck of the Union liner Makura” to give them the requisite publicity, and when they finally got there “pilgrims from Melbourne heard mass said in swaying express trains. It was the same on the Mara-ma, which brought the New Zealand pilgrims. The grand piano became an altar, and the social hall the temple of God”, and so on till it comes out the nose. 0 Ambrose! And after they finally got there, get this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The papal legate (Cardinal Cerretti), who just previously had laid a wreath on the Cenotaph in Martin place, was preceded by a gorgeous array of enpurpled prelates. In the setting of the majestic cathedral the display of rich vestments and elaborate ceremonial blended with the medieval atmosphere. To-night, at the Showground the display had at the beginning a bizarre atmosphere of theatricalism. The gigantic white temple with its four guardian angels, and the great high altar, were lit by a hundred flood lights. . . . The color of the mass was white, but because gold is an ecclesiastical substitute he was vested in glittering mitre and chasuble of gold. Golden vestments were also worn by his deacon, subdeacon, assistant priest, assistant deacons and the masters of ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here in America we are more given to simplicity, but here is something from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of March 25, 1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the penitential season Cardinal Hayes wore purple robes rather than the usual scarlet of his office. During the processional his crozicr was carried before him and his train was held by four small pages dressed in black velvet. Because of the length of the ritual there was no sermon.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>The Main Three-Ring Circus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">But the main three-ring circus of La Bottega is at the Vatican, and nothing that would help advertise the performance is ever overlooked. When it looked at one time as if Nobile would get to the north pole with his airship, you presented him with a five-foot walnut cross, weighted, which he was to drop when he got there, but you made the mistake of blessing the airship and it broke in two and never got there: so you still have the cross, ready for use at the next excuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When you gave your first broadcast the world all had to know that it was talked into “a goldmounted microphone”, and the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">of February 13, 1931, narrates the simple and unaffected w’ay in which you came to the microphone on that occasion, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heralded by the blare of the Vatican’s silver trumpets, the pope arrived at the wireless station by automobile at 4: 30 p.m. (10: 30 a.m New York time) followed by his noble and chamber attendants. He was dressed in white except for a scarlet cloak over his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The girl was a pure and innocent girl, except.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But hold! AVhat is this from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of June 30, 1930:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Purple hangings with gold fringes hung from each pillar. Thick carpets were placed on the floor along the route of the papal procession. ... At the sides of the main altar hand-painted standards pictured the new saints in heaven. The bronze statue of St. Peter was draped for the occasion in rich robes. . . . Heralded by the blare of silver trumpets, Pope Pius appeared in St. Peter's carried aloft on the sedia gesta-toria. [The chair has an opening in it through which, when a new pope is installed, a cardinal can feel to see if it is a man or another Pope Joan.] Over his head floated a white silk canopy supported by eight purplcclad attendants. Behind him swayed two flabelli, semicircular ostrich feather fans. Before him walked a brilliant procession of high church dignitaries, including a double row of cardinals in scarlet robes and white ermine capes. Grouped around the pope were his ecclesiastical, civil and military courts in medieval costumes, including every color of the rainbow. Behind him came a group of Swiss guards in steel breastplates and helmets, with heavy serpentine swords resting on their shoulders. The pope wore a magnificent cope of cream-colored silk, decorated with gold and silver, which enveloped him from shoulders to feet. On his head was a golden mitre, while his triregnum (triple crown) was carried on a red plush cushion by an attendant at his side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just contrast the above with the following: “Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well.” (John 4: 6) Or this by the apostle Paul:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me [not upon ‘Peter’] daily, the care of all the churches. —2 Corinthians 11: 24-28.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>From the “Catholic News”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">From the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic News</span><span class="font6"> of February 16,1929, we quote a press agent's account of the big act in the main tent. Any person who cannot see that this is the Devil trying to make a circus out of the cause of Christ in the earth, and making a good job of it, is fit only for the “ministry”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Swiss guards in their colorful uniforms stood guard at each side of the high altar, their figures dwarfed by the colossal proportions of the church. Priests in somber ecclesiastical garb, gorgeous bishops and patriarchs and ascetic monks moved in and out of the crowd. Many-hued noble guards, palatine guards and papal gendarmes added their mite to the riot of color. Thousands upon thousands of flickering candles were reflected from the cool marble columns and pillars and thin wisps of fragrant incense rising from the altar completed the scene.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Trumpets announce the pope. The pope’s coming was heralded by a blare of famous silver trumpets which flooded the church with a mellow, liquid melody. The hush which followed was broken by roars, cheers, salvos and handclapping when the pope, carried </span><span class="font6">on </span><span class="font5">high on the sedia gestatoria, appeared at the door of the chapel of the sacrament. He wore the gorgeous triregnum or triple crown and was enveloped in an ample white silk cloak beautifully embroidered in gold. As he raised his hand in blessing the green fisherman’s ring blazed at his finger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before him walked a double row of venerable white-haired cardinals in scarlet robes over which they wore the ermine capes of ceremonial occasions. Swiss guards, carrying enormous serpentine swords, and the highest lay dignitaries of papal court in medieval costumes with Elizabethan ruffs and wearing slender rapiers at their belts, surrounded him. Two flabelli, or semi-circular wdrite ostrich feather fans, borne aloft on long poles at each side, lent a note of added splendor to the scene.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The pope appeared deeply moved. Emotion was clearly painted on his features, which on public </span><span class="font6">oc</span><span class="font5">casions usually are entirely immobile. His eyes swept clearly over the crowd, tossing like a sea in a tempest, but the heightened color of his face and a slight tremor of his lips bore witness to the depth of his emotion. Each time he raised a hand in blessing waves of </span><span class="font6">en</span><span class="font5">thusiasm and wild cheering swept over the crowd. Some fell to their knees. Others waved handkerchiefs and all shouted their devotion. Cries of ‘Long </span><span class="font6">live </span><span class="font5">the pope and king!’ and ‘Long live the pope of conciliation!’ were heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Pontiff ascends the throne. Traversing the whole length of the church, the pontiff descended from the sedia gestatoria before the high altar and took his seat on the throne covered with white damask and surmounted by a red damask canopy erected to the left of the altar. Hidden electric lights played upon </span><span class="font6">him, </span><span class="font5">throwing him into bold relief—the cynosure of all eyes. All the cardinals immediately left their seats, filed before him and kissed his ring in a sign of fealty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, the service began, to which the pope listened from his throne. The same scenes of enthusiasm occurred when at the end of the service he reentered the sedia gestatoria and returned to his apartment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘While the mass was being sung St. Peter’s Square had been completely filled by a huge crowd waiting patiently in the rain under upraised umbrellas. The whole of the vast piazza was black with shiny umbrellas. When it became known that the pope had returned to his apartment a mighty shout was raised. ‘We want the pope, we want the pope,’ 200,000 throats shouted in unison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At last the door to the balcony over the main entrance of St. Peter’s was thrown open and a small group of cardinals appeared. Then </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font5"> seconds later the pope’s white figure, dwarfed by distance, appeared against the background of the cardinals’ scarlet robes and he raised one white-clad arm in blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The crowd as one man dropped to its knees, the umbrellas disappeared as if by magic and hats were removed from every head. Thus the immense crowd of 200,000 persons received the papal blessing bareheaded under a pouring rain and kneeling on the rain-soaked pavement. Another mighty shout accompanied the pope’s retirement into the Vatican again.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Sympathy for the Poor</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We appreciate your sympathy for the poor, Ambrose. In your very first broadcast you said, “We counsel the poor to remember the poverty of Christ.” The account says that on that occasion “the ceremony at Vatican City was simple. The pope, dressed in his white silk robe with a cross studded with jewels hanging from a gold chain around his neck”, did so and so. Somehow it is so much easier to encourage the poor to remember the poverty of Christ if one can himself sport a white silk robe, with plenty of jewelry and gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> May 19, 1929, telling of the way in -which your predecessors helped the poor to remember the poverty of Christ, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Forty goldsmiths were maintained at the papal court. Flagons of gold, jeweled cups, knife handles made of jasper and ivory and forks of mother of pearl and gold adorned the pope’s table on the occasion of splendid banquets. The state bed in the pope’s palace was draped in crimson velvet lined with ermine. There is the story of a gold cross weighing fifteen pounds and the silver arm of a saint costing 2,566 florins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We notice that on one particularly solemn occasion you are described as omitting “the customary military display and two flabelli, or semicircular ostrich-feather fans”, which usually traipse along with you wherever you go, and on this occasion “instead of wearing his tiara and gorgeous vestments, the pope wore only a bishop’s red robe and stole over his white robes”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No other person on earth ever had a wardrobe like yours, Ambrose. Each day you wear different garments, all of them ornamented with rich and rare gems. Your little skullcaps are of the finest and most beautiful silk. Your slippers of embroidered velvet are gorgeous to look at, and works of art. Your gloves are of white wool, embroidered with fine pearls in the shape of a cross. Your surplices are of the most valuable and beautiful lace. Your capa magna gleams from top to bottom with gold and precious stones. The rings which you wear are priceless. You have one chair of solid silver, beautifully chased, which weighs half a ton, and cost an American banker $60,000. You know all about our American banks, don’t you, Ambrose?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>“Woe to You That Are Rich”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">You know that the rich are out of luck, don’t you, Ambrose? It was the Lord who said, “Woe unto you that are rich!” (Luke 6:24) We noticed a while back that Cardinal Mundelein brought you a check for $1,500,000. Almost everybody thought how generous the American people are, but you and we know, Ambrose, that that money came to you from the American banking firm of Halsey, Stuart &amp;&nbsp;Company. They saw that you got the money, and you will see that they get theirs, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your fellow prelates are not so hard up, either. We notice that the old gentleman, Archbishop Kelly, of Sydney, was able to give a personal gift of £5,000 to liquidate the debt on his cathedral. Why shouldn’t he ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Oh, yes, about that gift of Cardinal Mundelein’s. The account says: “Cardinal Mundelein prostrated himself, but the pope affectionately raised him and embraced him. The audience broke all precedents for length, lasting more than one hour and a half.” Probably if he had brought another million he would have been given another hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking about the show at Dublin the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> commented upon the great number of girls dressed in long silk dresses, and the boys in white trousers and white shoes, and said: “Many of them had come from pitifully poor homes in Dublin’s slums, and more than a few families had gone hungry to dress them properly for the occasion.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>&quot;Thou Shalt Not Covet”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">You know, Ambrose, that the commandment ‘‘Thou shalt not covet” is several times repeated in the New Testament. (Romans 7:7; 13:9) Grace Link was stolen from her Protestant father at London, Ont., and placed in a convent at Hamilton till she was 18. Meantime the police searched high and low for her. The nuns wanted her mother’s property, and finally got it by that means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And there was Miss Jeanne Lemesneger, daughter of the wine merchant. She was released from her convent vows long enough to claim her father’s $1,500,000 fortune, when she was received back, money and all. It reminds us of the old farmer’s prayer. Nobody had ever been able to understand it, until finally a hired man who had been with the family for years said that what the old man really said was, “Money, money, money, for Christ’s sake. Amen.” We notice that in the Cincinnati archdiocese each parish is taxed 10 percent of its total revenue, which means much to the poor. In the Vatican you have a single painting that is 33 feet wide and 66 feet high, and marble bathtubs of such exquisite materials and workmanship that one of them would equal the cost of a great church building. And in your palace of 11,000 rooms you have many such tubs, Ambrose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other day, when a fire broke out in Cho-lula, Mexico, the dispatches carried the information that though the total population of the city is only 10,000, yet it has 100 churches. The Mexican government, seeing more than is seen in this country, see that your church business is not operated for the benefit of the people, but for the profit of the ones that are in the business. It holds that the people have too large a share of their earnings diverted to the erection and maintenance of useless ecclesiastical buildings, and that time which they should spend in working is given over to too many holy days for their own good.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Sundry and Divers Blessings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">We notice, Ambrose, that you are strong for this “blessing” business. Thus we know of you or your men to have bestowed blessings upon armies, battleships, airplanes, airships, hounds and horses. At Vincennes, France, “holy water” was sprinkled on 60 race horses as they walked in single file in front of the parish priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On February 13,1929, you “blessed” the whole world, while a great crowd was standing in a pouring rain. They knelt bareheaded in response, and since then have been in trouble up to their necks. On January 24, 1933, by direct radio communication, you “blessed” the United States, and on March 6 not a bank in the country was open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We noticed that at the conclusion of the negotiations between Italy and the Vatican, you “blessed” Italy’s negotiator, Domenico Barone, and he died in a few days. You awarded Justice R. C. Flannigan of Chicago the Grand Cross of St. Gregory, and he became very ill, and maybe died. Why award anybody the double cross? We think every plane you ever “blessed” went kerflop and all on board were lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Railsplitter</span><span class="font6"> writes feelingly of the papal blessings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope sent the Golden Rose to Bomba, king of Naples, and in less than twelve months he lost his crown and kingdom. He sent his blessing to Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria, and in less than twelve months he was defeated at Sadowa, and lost his Venetian dominions. He sent it then to Queen Isabella of Spain, and in a short time she lost both crown and dominions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope blessed the French showman Boulanger, and in less than two weeks he had to flee to Germany for refuge. The princess of Brazil, when near her accouchement, requested the interposition of the pope and his blessing on her child. She received it, and the child was born deformed. Maxilian was killed a short time after being blessed by the pope as emperor of Mexico, and his wife became insane after going to Rome and receiving the benediction. The pope neglected some official business in order to give his special blessing to an English steamer laden with Sisters of Charity for South America in 1870, and it never reached its destination. Every soul on board perished. The empress of Brazil was blessed but once; that was enough, she broke her leg three days afterward. It may be remembered that the floating palace delayed its starting from Montevideo to Buenos Aires until it received the assurance of safety in the papal blessing. It then raised its anchor, sailed out to sea, and went down in two days. “The Order of Christ” was conferred by the pope on Dr. Windhorst, his great champion in Germany. He died in less than a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">August, 1895, the archbishop of Damascus, in addressing the Spanish troops at Victoria when about to start for Cuba, declared that the pope, like a new Moses, had raised his hands to heaven and prayed for victory. We know the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Grand Bazaar de Charite in Paris on May 4, 1897, had the papal nuncio to deliver the benediction. It was scarcely five minutes afterward when the building was in flames, and nearly 150 of the society ladies of Paris lost their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At all events, Ambrose, we know for certain that you shall never have cause to bless </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> And for that we feel safe, and are very glad. ‘‘The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; and he addeth no sorrow therewith.”— Proverbs 10:22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>As to Holy Year</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">So then, as to your blessing and sanctifying 1933 as a &quot;holy year”, we are, in view of all the foregoing, reminded of Isaiah G6:3: “He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood: he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ambrose, there are no people on earth that are as truly eager for a truly Holy Year as the readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> They pray for it every time they pray the Lord’s Prayer, and work for it and proclaim it at every opportunity. That Holy Year, Ambrose, will come when the Devil and the Devil religions, of which yours is one of the chief of all, go down in everlasting shame and defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Circus Man Pays His Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">BUDAPEST circus man, unable to pay his taxes otherwise, gave the city seven lions and thirteen apes and they squared the account. Good idea, and suggests a better one. A few' years from now there will be a big demand to see wdiat a man looks like who believes 3 times 1 are 1, and that an infinitely loving God intends to eternally roast almost all humanity in the strangling fumes of burning sulphur for something somebody else did six thousand years ago. Why couldn’t such men earn something traveling with the side show’ of a circus, and w’hen the show got hard up they could be sw’apped with some city administration to liquidate the circus’ tax bill? Many of them believe that their ancestors W’ere monkeys and should therefore be quite ready to go in the cages W’ith their putative relatives. Now, isn’t that the truth? They are certainly of no good for anything else.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Distress and Perplexity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">have gripped the peoples of earth for the past five years. Conditions continue to go from bad to worse. Amidst an abundance of material wealth, food and raiment, millions have no opportunity to earn and enjoy the necessities of life. The farmers and laborers are crying out against this miserable condition. Fear has laid hold upon men everywhere and, sensing greater calamities approaching, their hearts fail them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let it be conceded that the rulers have done their best according to human knowledge to alleviate these miserable conditions. They have failed and will continue to fail. Almost all the nations are now ruled by dictators, and the people stand helpless, looking to hands to help them which are powerless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everywhere the questions are now being asked: Cannot something be done ? What are we going to do </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> What will be the end of these miserable times ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries good people have believed that the Bible is Jehovah God’s Word of truth, given for man’s instruction. Centuries ago God foreknew and foretold that the present time of distress would come upon the world exactly as it has come. God is in no way responsible for it, but He has a complete remedy, and the only means of escape.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>The Crisis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">is here! The people need comfort, that they may know what to do. Why longer give car to the abortive plans and schemes of men? Why not give heed to the Word of God and learn the certain way of relief ? This knowledge is of most vital importance to you just now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The books listed here point out the facts in the light of divine prophecy so that you can see and readily understand the cause and the remedy for the world’s ills. There is no desire to get the people to join something. The books are not put out by a commercial arrangement. To be sure, it costs money to publish them. The sole purpose in publishing them is to help the people. In the language of Jesus, ‘‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.” The small amount of money taken for these books is used in supplying other books that more people may learn what now they greatly need to know.

<p><span class="font0">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all tilings; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world: that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Act of March 3, 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY STUDIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company should select the issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">the majority desire to study. We suggest the current issue, that all may keep up to date. The better method of study is to have some one in the company who can read well to read a paragraph or two and then have questions propounded and briefly discussed in order that the substance of the paragraph may be clearly ascertained. Questions should always be confined to the subject matter under consideration in the paragraph read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REMITTANCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosing coin or currency with an order for books or other publications often results in disappointment when the sender is notified that neither order nor remittance has been received by us. In this day of disturbed financial conditions even the use of checks involves a needless risk. We suggest that every one use the money order (either postal or express). Keep each money order receipt for reference. For all remittances the money order should be made payable to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, with a memorandum attached as to how much is desired for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> or for anything else. Make no remittances to International Bible Students Association, as that only causes more work and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO AND THE PRINTED WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All witnessing parties and all individuals who engage in the witness work should mention the radio station in their vicinity that is broadcasting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font2"> programs. This often proves a means of opening the way to place the books in the hands of the people. Have in mind that the chief purpose of the radio is to call the people’s attention to the truth and then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding of the message concerning the government of Jehovah by reading what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every one who now participates in the field work in territory served by broadcasts of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">watchtower</span><span class="font2"> program may have a share in telling the people that this unique service is available each week. Workers report that distribution of the radio folder (supplied by the Society) is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font2"> public notice of this program while engaging in the house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNOUNCING MEETING PLACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where the radio is used to broadcast the Truth, it would be well to announce the local meeting place of the company for Bible study. Consent to so announce should be obtained from the manager of the station, and, since the time is paid for, it is presumed that this may be done. This will enable the interested to find a place for study and further consideration of the Lord’s Word.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>WHO IS FOR JEHOVAH?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“So Moses took his stand in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is for Jehovah? To me! Then gathered unto him all the sons of Levi.”—Exodus 32:26, Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH caused many prophetic pictures to be made and a record thereof kept and preserved for the special benefit of his people who are on the earth at the end of the world. Now it pleases Jehovah to permit his children to understand these pictures for their aid and comfort. Jehovah sent Moses as his messenger, prophet and deliverer to lead the Israelites out of Egypt that they might know and worship God in a proper manner. While Moses was in the mountain receiving the tables of the law at the hand of Jehovah, the Israelites, yielding to the influence of their tribal leaders, employed an idol in their worship. Jehovah sent Moses back to the Israelites, who were encamped at the base of the mountain; and when Moses learned what had taken place in his absence he, with righteous indignation and positive declaration, took his stand at the gate of the camp and called upon all to show where they stood, using the words in the text above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In this prophetic picture Moses represented Christ Jesus, the great Prophet. The Levites represented those who have entered into a covenant to do the will of God, and from which company the priestly class is taken; while the other Israelites in this picture represented all who hear the Word of God and who take their stand either for or against Jehovah. In this picture the Levites were the only ones shown to have taken their stand with Moses. This prophetic picture is at least a striking illustration of what takes place at the end of the world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah used Joshua, after Moses had concluded his service, to lead the Israelites into Canaan. The time came when Joshua put the question squarely before the Israelites that they might determine whom they would serve. To them he said: “Now therefore fear [Jehovah], and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell • but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Josh.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">24:14,15) This is another striking illustration that applies particularly at the present day. Joshua pictured Christ Jesus, while his house pictured those who are of the house of the Lord God, that is to say, the remnant who must be wholly and completely devoted to Jehovah and serve him in sincerity and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah requires obedience of his sons, and a failure or refusal to obey is rebellion and the sin of witchcraft. “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is 5s iniquity and idolatry.” (1 Sam. 15:23) That which the divine record discloses concerning Moses and Joshua, as stated in the above text, announces a fixed principle or rule of action of Jehovah, to wit, that those who are pleasing to God, and who receive his favor and maintain their integrity toward him, must take their stand on the side of the Lord God and serve him unequivocally and without compromise and in sincerity and in truth. Such rule or fixed principle never changes, and what was true in the day of Moses and Joshua is equally true now. The only difference so far as the people are concerned is that now they have a greater amount of knowledge concerning Jehovah and his purposes and therefore the greater is their responsibility. Since 1918 the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Moses, Ihe Prophet, Priest and Judge, is at the temple, and he affords the opportunity to the people to take their stand against or on the side of Jehovah. “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2:20) “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” (Ps. 11: 4) The “sons of Levi” stand before the Lord at the temple for trial and purging, and those who come through the fire and are approved are made a part of the house of the Lord that they may offer unto Jehovah an offering of sacrifice and praise in righteousness. (Mal. 3:1-4) It is certain that no one would be permitted to remain in the house or temple of the Lord who wavers or compromises in any manner with the enemy and about whose devotion and service to Jehovah there is any question. All of the temple company are now un-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">der the immediate command of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, and every soul that does not obey him must suffer the fixed penalty. (Acts 3: 22, 23) To be for Jehovah means nothing less than complete devotion to him and to render unconditional service to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Since coming to the temple the Greater Moses, as Jehovah’s official representative, gives commandment to God’s covenant people, to wit: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. ’ ’ (Matt. 24:14) “This gospel of the kingdom” means that the time limit for Satan to rule the world without hindrance has come to an end; that Christ the rightful Ruler of the world is present and has begun his reign; and that Jehovah is the only true God, and that the time has come for the expression of his vengeance against the enemy, and for the vindication of his holy name, and that hence the opportunity must be given to the people to know that Jehovah is God. The temple class, thus commanded to preach, constitute the people whom Jehovah has taken out of the world for his name and therefore must make known his name to others. (Acts 15:14) These are the ones into whose mouth God has put his Word that they might use it as he has commanded. (Isa. 51:16) These are the ones whom Jehovah has made his witnesses to tell the people that he is God. (Isa. 43: 9-12) They must be on Jehovah’s side and remain there steadfastly and thus maintain their integrity, if they would live and abide for ever in his house. There is no alternative. They must obey implicitly the commandments of the Lord and do so joyfully.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS VENGEANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The commission which God has given to his anointed people contains these words: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: ... to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isa. 61:1,2) The vengeance of Jehovah is against every part of Satan’s organization because that organization has defamed God’s name and has deceived the people and turned them away from God. The offenders must have notice served upon them; and those who have been deceived, and who may desire to know the truth, must have an opportunity to hear the truth, that they may take their stand on the side of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> There are those who claim to be followers of Christ Jesus and who not only fail to obey the commandments of the Lord to preach the truth concerning the day of vengeance of our God, and his kingdom, but who severely criticize those who are diligent in their endeavors to obey the divinely-given commission. In Canada the clergy and their allies have prevented the kingdom message from being broadcast by radio, assigning as a reason therefor that the spoken message criticized the clergy and public officials of the worldly organization. One who signs himself as “Bible Student” caused to be published in the Toronto </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font3"> recently a letter which in substance says: “While the organization [Bible Students] was founded by Pastor Russell in the 70’s, yet the real followers of the teachings of Pastor Russell left the Society some years ago. . . . Real International Bible Students resent being coupled with what is being put forth nowadays by the Society as the teachings of the Bible Students. Pastor Russell clearly outlined his position as regards the attitude to be adopted towards the churches and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">worldly institutions.</span><span class="font3"> He condemned harshness of language and intolerant bearing. If Doctor Hague has the last book published by Pastor Russell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The, New Creation,</span><span class="font3"> let him turn to page 607 and the contrast between Judge Rutherford and Pastor Russell’s instructions will be emphatically shown.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Here is further evidence of the complete blindness of those who once claimed to follow the Lord but who rejected the truth of the coming of the Lord to his temple, and which shows that they are not of the temple class, and that they are in the dark. Volume Six of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font3"> page 607 above mentioned, reads:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> ‘ ‘ Some, we believe, have gone to an extreme in denouncing present institutions in a manner that the Lord and the apostles neither commanded nor sanctioned, nor illustrated in their words and conduct. We should remember that the world as a whole is living up to as high a standard as it appreciates, and that simply to find fault with matters which others are as powerless to correct as ourselves is worse than useless, because it merely produces unhappiness, vexation, etc., without accomplishing desired results.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The writer of that letter did not ask the reader to look further. The very next page, to wit, page 608, same book, shows that the writer of that book saw that the time would come when the Lord would cause his vengeance to be declared. (Take note that Brother Russell wrote the quoted words in 1904.) He there said:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> “ In such matters we may well follow the example of Michael the archangel, who did not even bring a railing accusation against Satan, but said, ‘The Lord rebuke thee!’—in his own time and manner. (Jude 9) So with us. Realizing that the Lord will rebuke present institutions in his own time and manner, we can say to ourselves, with the Apostle, ‘Be patient, brethren; the coming of the Lord draweth nigh’—the establishment of his Kingdom, near at hand, will rectify all these difficulties. The agitation of these matters IN ADVANCE WILL be not only unavailing, but worse—disadvantageous, injurious.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Since the writing of the above-mentioned book the Lord has come to his temple, his kingdom is begun, he is at the temple for judgment, and since then he calls upon those who hear, saying as did Moses: “Who is on the side of Jehovah?” and who will be faithful in proclaiming the truth? No man could be faithful to Jehovah now and fail or refuse to declare God’s vengeance against every part of Satan’s organization. The foregoing letter of the so-called “Bible Student” shows that all such persons went completely blind when they rejected the coming of the Lord to his temple. They did not love his appearing. (2 Tim. 4: 7, 8) This ought to be an encouragement to those who are wavering and to show them that they must quickly take their stand on the side of Jehovah and stay there, if they would live.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Those who fear man or who desire to please men, or who, to avoid the criticism of men, fail or refuse to obey the Lord in declaring his vengeance against Satan and his wicked organization, cut themselves off from Jehovah’s organization and, as shown by the Scriptures, are gathered out and set aside. Until God sent forth his beloved Son to reign, even Christ Jesus was commanded to say nothing and do nothing against Satan; but when the due time came Jesus began his vigorous action against Satan the enemy, and the Lord declares that ‘in that day all the faithful must willingly do the same thing’. (Ps. 110:1-3) The so-called “Bible Student” above mentioned shows he has taken his stand on the side of Satan’s organization and made himself an ally with the clergy who are of Satan’s organization and who bitterly oppose the kingdom. Let every one do as he desires, but as for the remnant, they are on the Lord’s side and will obey his commandment, by his grace, without fear and without compromise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Jerusalem was a type of “Christendom”, and Jehovah sent his witnesses to that wicked city to give warning and testimony against them and to tell of his purpose to destroy the city because of the unfaithfulness on the part of the Jews. Suppose these witnesses whom Jehovah sent to the Israelites had said in substance, like the “Bible Student”: “We cannot afford to say anything in criticism of Ahab and Jezebel, and the priests of Baal, and the false prophets, and clergy, because that might offend someone and thus disclose the fact that we are not kind and considerate with all persons. Therefore we will go easy and see to it that with our soft speech and honeyed words we do not offend and that we have developed a beautiful character. ’ ’ Such a course would have been taking sides with the wicked crowd of the Devil, and hence taking their stand against Jehovah, and Jehovah would have at once rejected such and no longer used them as his witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Suppose, when Ezekiel was commanded to carry Jehovah’s message of denunciation to Jerusalem, he had said: “Those clergymen at Jerusalem are very honorable men, and the principal ones of the synagogues are wealthy merchants, and doctors and politicians, and I cannot afford to offend them.” Such a course on the part of Ezekiel would have been disloyalty to God and would have brought about Ezekiel’s death. The day was approaching when God would destroy Jerusalem because of unfaithfulness of that people. Correspondingly the day is now rapidly approaching when Jehovah will destroy “Christendom” and all of Satan’s organization because of rebellion and unfaithfulness. Jehovah sent his servant Ezekiel to bear his message of truth to the people, and now Jehovah sends his witnesses to bear a like message to “Christendom”. When Ezekiel went to Jerusalem the Jews blustered and bluffed and tried to frighten him, just as the clergy and their allies of “Christendom” now attempt to do with Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. God foreknew this, of course, and his commandment to Ezekiel, and which commandment applies with stronger force to Jehovah’s witnesses now, was couched in these words: “But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted. Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. As an adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. Moreover, he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.” (Ezek. 3: 7-10,17,18) Let everyone who claims to be in the covenant with Jehovah now take the responsibility of refusing to obey God or choose to take his stand on Jehovah’s side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> It is wholly untrue that Pastor Russell founded the organization of Jehovah’s people and taught them what to say and do. No man has any authority to establish an organization for Jehovah God and then tell them what to say. Those who are the anointed witnesses of Jehovah do not heed the message from any man, but as long as they are faithful they will be on Jehovah’s side, be taught by him, and obey his Word in sincerity and in truth. Those who follow the teachings of any man and disregard the plain teachings of the Lord God show conclusively that they are not of God’s organization. What Pastor Russell said on page 607, above quoted, was correct when applied in the right period of the church; but he saw at that time that sometime in the near future there must be a more strenuous witness given, and the presumption is that if he were on the earth today he would be faithful to the Lord and therefore would be giving forth the strong message from the Lord. To declare the day of the vengeance of our God is as vitally a part of the divine commission as any other part thereof, and in due time that vengeance must be declared; and the due time has now come. This declaration of vengeance must be made between the time of the coming of the Lord to his temple and Armageddon. There would be no occasion to so declare his vengeance after Armageddon is fought. Only those who are the sons of Jehovah, bom of his woman or organization, are now taught of God and understand and appreciate the fact that they cannot side-step any part of the commission given by Jehovah to his anointed ones. They do not desire to side-step it, but in joy and in peace they declare it. (Isa. 54:13) Jehovah God is not pleased with those who worship and serve him through the teachings of some man, any more than he was with the Israelites worshiping him by and through the image of a golden calf. Such was shown to be the sin of Samaria, and the so-called “Bible Students” above mentioned are exactly in that class. (Amos 8:14) The question now is: “Who is for Jehovah?” Who is worshiping and serving him in sincerity and in truth? Those who please him will now obey his commandments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMISSION TO PREACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1T</sup> No man or man-made government can grant to one of Jehovah’s witnesses the privilege to preach the gospel; and for the same reason no man or man-made government can censor or abridge or forbid the message of the gospel that is to be preached. Recently the Radio Commission of Canada, at the request of certain clergymen of the Anglo-American empire system, ordered and forbade any of the Watchtower programs to be broadcast until first a copy thereof was submitted to and approved by such commission. Immediately after such order was issued someone supposed to be of God’s organization, acting in an ill-advised manner and without proper authority, delivered to the Radio Commission a number of the transcription records in accordance with the order of such Commission. Such action in submitting the transcription records was equivalent to saying to the Radio Commission: “You are privileged to examine these records as you request and pass upon them and determine our right to use them. We want to show you that we are obedient to the laws of the land.” Such action in thus delivering these transcription records to the Radio Commission was an insult to the Lord and therefore a gross sin. The message contained in those transcription records is not the message of any man, but it is the message or gospel of the kingdom, which the Lord has commanded must be preached as a witness; and no man or commission composed of men can rightfully exercise censorship over that message or prevent the people from hearing. The objection raised by the Commission and hireling clergy to the message is that the speech criticizes the clergy and men in public office. It is true that God’s Word expresses his disapproval and his indignation against the false prophets or clergymen who have defamed his name and misled the people, and against the commercial power that has oppressed and is yet oppressing the people, and against the unfaithful men in public office who have ruled and have used their office to fraudulently deceive the people and to oppress them, and against all who have oppressed and still oppress and oppose Jehovah’s witnesses. The combined power of these nations has broken the everlasting covenant time and again. God has given commandment that these ruling powers shall be informed of his purpose to destroy completely Satan’s organization, of which they are a part, and that the people must be advised of his purpose, that they may know that he is the Most High, and that they may be given an opportunity to take their stand on Satan’s side and go down, or on Jehovah God’s side and live. This is Jehovah God’s message, not that of any man. No human organization has any right or authority to censor or stop the proclamation of that message, and those who do so will do so at their own peril.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Some of God’s people have shown timidity or fear in carrying out the commandments of Jehovah God and have hesitated to deliver the message. Some say, “I fear not man or devil,” while complying with man’s request. Fear is not confined to a morbid dread of suffering personal injury. Fear also means willingness to appear as being fair to men or organizations; for instance, to say to the Radio Commission: “We wish to show you that we are eminently fair, and that our message is all right, and we submit it for your examination.” The inducement for such speech and action is clearly a desire to please men, and that is an element of fear of man, and the fear of man leads into the snare of the Devil. (Prov. 29:25) The Devil set the snare through his agents, and the one delivering the transcription records walked into the snare. To his anointed Jehovah says: “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary,” for you.—Isa. 8:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah sent Jeremiah the prophet as his witness to Jerusalem, and thus he foreshadowed the anointed remnant being now sent forth as witnesses in the name of Jehovah to “Christendom”. Jeremiah at first was timid, and God spoke to him: “But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.” (Jer. 1:7-9) Likewise Jehovah now says to his remnant: “I have put my words in thy mouth.” (Isa. 51:16) This is the day of God’s vengeance and the vindication of his name; and as he said to Jeremiah, so now he says to the people taken out for his name, the remnant : ‘ ‘ See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.” (Jer. 1:10) At the command of Jehovah Jeremiah went to Jerusalem and said to the Israelites: “For my [covenant] people have committed two evils; they [the clergymen and the principal of the flock] have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns [their own cisterns, man-made doctrines], broken cisterns, that can hold no water [truth].” (Jer. 2:13) In fulfilment of this prophecy “Christendom” has substituted the League of Nations for God’s kingdom, and its clergy have substituted higher criticism and other man-made doctrines for the Word of God; and God commands his witnesses to tell them so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Suppose that after Jeremiah had prepared his speech and had appeared in Jerusalem to deliver it the officers or rulers or commissioners had said to him: “You cannot deliver that speech until you first submit it to us for our approval; and if we see anything in it about the priests or clergymen, we will not permit you to speak.” Had Jeremiah handed over his speech to them and said, “All right, look at it and let me know what you think of it,” he would have thus been insulting Jehovah and committing a gross sin. But Jeremiah did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he kept in mind that God had said to him: “A prophet to the nations I appointed thee. . . . And whatsoever I command thee shalt thou speak; be not afraid of their faces.” (Jer. 1:5-8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> Did Jeremiah “put on the soft pedal” or hesitate to state the truth of and concerning the clergy and their allies ? He did not! The major portion of his prophecy is a message from the Lord excoriating the false prophets, the pastors, clergymen and principal of their flocks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Not only have ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, her clergy and the principal of the flock departed from their obligation to God, but they have broken the everlasting covenant and treated as a common thing the blood of Christ Jesus, the only means of salvation for man. Jeremiah therefore represented Jehovah’s witnesses now on the earth, and his message is a sample of the message Jehovah’s witnesses must tell to “Christendom”. At God’s commandment Jeremiah, among other things, said to the clergy, and said it publicly and in the hearing of the people: “For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done; thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways; a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jer. 2: 22-24, 34) What would the Canadian Radio Commission say about that message? If Jeremiah were there they would not let him speak it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The clergy of the present time, exactly as the clergy of the Jews, associated themselves with the giants of commerce and the professional politicians, whom they make the principal ones of their flock; and God commands that this message shall be delivered to them, even as he commanded Jeremiah: “For among my people are found wicked men; they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. They are waxen fat, they shine i yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper: and the right of the needy do they not judge. Shall I not visit for these things ? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets [clergy] prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof ? ’ ’ (Jer. 5:26-31) “Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets [clergymen], and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the Lord; I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.” (Jer. 13:13,14) At the command of the Lord Jeremiah continued to warn the people of the approaching disaster coming upon Jerusalem, even as Jehovah’s witnesses are now commanded to warn “Christendom”. The clergy tell the people that no trouble is coming but that “everything will be all right soon”, and that “we are just entering a period of great prosperity, and that ‘organized Christendom’ will make the world a fit place in which to live”. As Jeremiah said, so now the Lord says concerning them: “Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets [clergymen] prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets [clergymen] that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets [clergymen] be consumed.”—Jer. 14:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The clergy have scattered God’s people, and now Jehovah has selected out humble men and women to carry the truth to the people who desire to hear, and the clergy and their allies try to prevent the people from hearing the truth as spoken by Jehovah’s witnesses, even as they did in Jeremiah’s day. God directed Jeremiah, and likewise now his witnesses, to say: “Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord.” (Jer. 23:1) The clergy have turned millions away from the Lord by their false prophesies or preachings, and concerning them Jehovah says: “I have not sent these prophets [clergymen], yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. Behold, I am against the prophets [clergy], saith the Lord, that use their tongues and say, He saith. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.” (Jer. 23:21,22,31,40) These pastors or clergymen are false shepherds, and the commercial giants and professional politicians are the chief ones in their congregations, and to them Jehovah says: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. ’ ’—Jer. 25: 34-36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Had Jeremiah submitted his message to the Radio Commission of Canada he would not have made any progress in delivering it to the people as he was commanded by Jehovah to do, and he would certainly then have been in a nice mess. Even so are Jehovah’s witnesses in a bad mess when they submit God’s message to the censors for them to pass upon. Jesus must have had this very thing in mind when he said: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.” (Matt. 7:6) The Lord repeatedly likens the clergy to dogs, even dumb dogs, and the principal of their flock as unclean, which is symbolized by the swine, and when such are known to be opponents of the truth the submitting to them of the message for censorship merely gives them an opportunity to ‘turn and rend you’, as Jesus said they would do. Does any faithful witness of Jehovah suppose for one moment that the men of the Radio Commission would look over the message of truth and approve it and say, Speak on? They would not; but, on the contrary, they would turn on Jehovah’s witnesses and denounce them. Why then insult the Lord by disobeying his commandments? Shall God ask the Devil or any one of his representatives if his message shall be delivered to the people? Jehovah’s witnesses represent the Lord, and they stand in his strength and by his grace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2S</sup> Jehovah has taken out from amongst the world a people for his name, and these he has constituted his witnesses and commanded them what message they must deliver. The message is not man’s message, but God’s. No witness of Jehovah could properly use harsh words against individuals, but his business is to deliver God’s message of vengeance against every part of Satan’s organization; and he cannot maintain his integrity unless he faithfully does so in obedience to God’s commandment. God’s Word of truth does the cutting, and it should be spoken plainly, firmly and yet without harshness. For this reason Jehovah’s witnesses cannot go to the police officers and ask permission to preach the gospel of the kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses are law-abiding and obey every law that is not in conflict with God’s law; but when there is a conflict, then the faithful will be obedient to God and not to man. The apostles went about preaching Christ and him crucified. The clergy, the police officers, “strong-arm squad” and magistrates called these faithful men before them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John said unto them: “We ought to obey God rather than man.” (Acts 4:18,19; 5:29) Jehovah’s witnesses follow the same course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> Jehovah sent Jesus to deliver his testimony; and how far would he have progressed with it if the priests, the clergymen and their allies had been permitted to censor that message? It was not then the time to declare the day of the vengeance of our God, but it was time for Jesus to tell the hypocritical clergymen the truth; and he told them plainly that they were the children of the Devil. (John 8:44) Did Jesus put on the soft pedal and hand in his speech to the Pharisees or the Radio Commission and say: “Gentlemen, here is what I expect to say on the sabbath day, and I should be glad to have you look it over and tell me whether it is satisfactory”? On the contrary, Jesus stood before the multitude and told all his hearers about the hypocritical clergy, and never were there more scathing or cutting words uttered than the words of Jesus appearing in Matthew 23:13-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> Now we are in the day when Christ has been enthroned as King and has sent forth his faithful remnant to deliver his testimony, a part of which is to declare the day of the vengeance of our God. It is the testimony which Jehovah has commanded shall be given that all may receive warning and notice that his purpose is to destroy Satan’s organization. To submit God’s message of truth to any part of Satan’s organization for censoring or examination that permission might be given to deliver it, or to ask permission to preach the message, is a gross sin before God, rendering the offender unclean because he is thus touching a dead body, that is, Satan’s organization. The only way to be cleansed from such sin, even if committed inadvertently, is by deep humiliation, supplication and prayer before Jehovah, acknowledging the sin, and by the washing of the Word, and then following faithfully the instruction of God’s Word. This was pictured by sprinkling the offender with the ashes of the red heifer mixed with living waters. (Num. 19:1-20; Dan. 9:3; Heb. 10:22; Eph. 5: 26) Those of the temple are specifically commanded to “touch not the unclean” nor to have any ‘agreement with’ Satan’s organization. (2 Cor. 6:15-18) To be sure, the faithful will be misunderstood by many persons; but what does that amount to ? Every faithful man that has maintained his integrity toward God has been misrepresented by the Devil and misunderstood by his blind dupes. The Lord is at his temple, his sanctuary is cleansed, and those who abide therein must be clean. God’s people must hold themselves entirely aloof from Satan’s organization and see to it that they diligently obey the commandments of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> To be faithful to the Lord does not mean that his witnesses need to be unkind or harsh; nor should they single out men and provoke them to anger. Jehovah’s witnesses occupy the most honorable position that could be given to man, and these should deport themselves accordingly. Jehovah God has given this honor to them, and he will give it to none other; and only those who prove themselves faithful and maintain their integrity will continue to have this honor. (Isa. 42:8) They must decline to have anything in common with Satan’s organization or his representatives, being kind, yet firm, in their speech; and they must take a firm stand on the side of Jehovah God and maintain that position without deviation or compromise. They must speak the truth as commanded, regardless of what any creature may say or do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRAYING FOR ALL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> One propounds a question to this effect: “Should the remnant pray for all, including those in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life?” citing 1 Timothy 2:1, 2 in support of an affirmative answer to the question. It is surprising that anyone who really thinks he is taught of God would now ask such a question or have any doubt about the matter. (Isa. 54:13) The Lord having come to his temple, he makes clear to his people what is the will of Jehovah. Even if Paul referred to earthly rulers when he wrote the above text, that was long before the day of the vengeance of our God. Since the coming of the Lord to the temple God’s judgment of wrath must be declared, and God teaches his people the things for which they must pray from that time forward. (Ps. 83:1-18) Even Jesus was not permitted to take action against Satan until due time. (Ps. 110:1,2) Now the judgment of Jehovah must be declared because the time has come when he will search out all of his enemies, and the prayer of the faithful shall always be in harmony with Jehovah’s purposes. (Ps. 149:9; Luke 19:27; Ps. 21: 8-12) God’s kingdom is here, and particularly the rulers of “Christendom” have been so informed; and they have all set themselves up against Jehovah and his kingdom. To pray for such rulers would be in violation of God’s expressed will. Surely no faithful one who has taken his stand on the side of Jehovah could pray for the enemy or any part of the enemy organization when God sends them forth to declare that the enemy organization shall shortly fall. The fact that a man in public office speaks publicly and mentions the name of God and quotes from his Word is no evidence that he is on the side of Jehovah. His actions speak louder than his words. The clergy and the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” quote scriptures and even claim to be on the side of God, and could it be said that it is the will of God that we should pray for them? (1 John 5:16; Ps. 83:16-18; See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> January 15, 1933) When Paul wrote to Timothy, the rulers were wickedly persecuting the followers of Christ and defaming the name of Jehovah; and surely he was not telling him to pray for such men. The words of Paul at 1 Timothy 2:1, 2 must be harmonized with Romans 13:1-3. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> June 1 and June 15, 1929.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> The question is, Who is on the side of Jehovah? Are all men at this time on his side? Most assuredly not! Satan is gathering all the nations to Armageddon to make a final war against God and against his anointed. Can anyone who is in office as a visible ruler in Satan’s organization be on the side of Jehovah at this time? Most assuredly not! Jehovah God is now in his holy temple, and he bids all to be still and hear his message. (Hab. 2:20) If earthly rulers in this day were seeking to obey Jehovah God they would not attempt to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from delivering the message of truth. None of the temple class, who are of the elect, will be deceived by the platitudes of public men or by anyone else or anything else. The elect cannot be deceived now. The faithful remnant will say: “We are of the house of Jehovah God, and Jehovah we will serve.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> This is the day when God sends forth his witnesses to mark in their foreheads the teachable ones who seek to know God and to do right, and also to gather coals of fire and scatter them over “Christendom”. (Ezek. 9:4; Zeph. 2:2,3; Ezek. 10:2-7) No one can faithfully and diligently obey the commandments of God at this time and at the same time ‘ ‘ lead a quiet and peaceable life”. It is a fight from henceforth. The remnant cannot be faithful in delivering the testimony in such places as Bergenfield, New Jersey, and at the same time lead a peaceable and quiet life. The temple class is being prepared for war, and their peace and quietness comes not from earthly rulers, but from Jehovah God. They are at rest, but their rest is in the Lord, while they are fighting for that which is right. (Isa. 26:2-4) Those who are in the temple, and hence on the side of Jehovah, willingly and joyfully sing his praises as they march forth to the war. (2 Chron. 20:1-27) They are good and faithful soldiers following the lead of Christ Jesus, the great Field Marshal, and they are not looking for peace and quietness at the hands of those who rule Satan’s organization. The faithful are proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom to those people of good will pictured by Jehonadab and who desire to be comforted with the message and to leave the Devil’s organization and take their stand on the side of Jehovah. To maintain their integrity Jehovah’s witnesses must stand firmly on his side and continue to joyfully sing the praises of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>EMPIRE BUILDERS REJECT THE HEAD STONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">M</span><span class="font3">ORE than seven centuries before the Christian era there was a prophet who foretold the strange events of our day with reference to that which is styled “Christendom”. This prophet, Isaiah by name, and who is one of the major prophets of the Bible, wrote: ‘ ‘ Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. ’ ’ {Isa. 28:16,17) A prophet still earlier than Isaiah wrote concerning the same symbolic “stone” and said: ’‘The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.” (Ps. 118:22,23) Centuries after these inspired prophecies there arose the greatest prophet ever on earth, Jesus Christ himself, and he declared that these prophecies were fulfilled in himself, and that he, as the one whom God has anointed to be King over earth, is the stone in question.—Matt. 21; 42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the year nineteen hundred and fourteen (A.D.), as all the facts and prophecies involved do clearly show, God placed his anointed King upon his throne and directed him to begin his rule amongst the enemy, the ruling powers of this world, both invisible and visible. (Ps. 2:6; 110:2) Three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in nineteen hundred and eighteen, the Lord came to his temple, God’s spiritual temple. At that time the Lord Jesus presented himself to his professed people in “Christendom” as their King and earth’s rightful Governor. This he did by the message from the Word of God that he caused to be sent forth to “Christendom” and also the fulfilments of prophecy which showed that the end of the world had been reached and that the time for his kingdom had come. At that time, that is, nineteen hundred and eighteen, Jesus Christ was also a “tried” and “ precious ” Stone, according to the words of the prophecies. During the momentous years of the World War, there was not only war on our earth, but also, as the Scriptures show, a tremendous war in heaven. In the great battle fought in heaven between Christ Jesus and the enemy Satan, Christ Jesus was victorious, and was therefore tried, true and faithful, and the Conqueror. (Rev. 12:7-10) When, in the complete fulfilment of the prophecies, he presented himself to earth’s ruling powers as earth’s rightful King, those of his professed people who believed and accepted him rejoiced greatly, and to them he is and ever will be “precious”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At that time the prophecy was fulfilled in completion so far as the laying of the corner stone is concerned. Then followed the revealing and proclaiming of the divine truth, which truth the Lord God has used and is using to sweep away the refuge of lies with which Satan has blinded the minds of the people. In quoting from the prophecy the Apostle Peter says: “Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. ’ ’ —1 Pet. 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus, is both the foundation and the chief corner stone. The foundation stone of the building is that which bears up the weight of the building. There comes a time, as the building progresses, that the proper angle or line of the building must be fixed. The chief stone is placed in the building, and to that the plumb line is dropped and every stone must be made to conform to that chief corner stone. As the material of the house (or temple) of the Lord which King Solomon built in Jerusalem was prepared in advance and the house was erected without noise of hammer or iron, even so the material for the glorious house of the Lord is prepared and brought together without noise or confusion. The chief corner stone is laid and the other stones of the building are made to conform thereto, because they must be in the image and likeness of the chief corner stone, Christ Jesus.—Rom. 8: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s prophet, speaking of the same precious Stone, said: “He shall be . . . for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel.” (Isa. 8:14) There were two parts of the house of Israel in ancient times; first, the ruling class in the south part of Palestine, who claimed to know the law of God, and who heard Jesus and had every reason to believe that he was the Messiah, the Christ; and, second, the common people, more particularly those who resided in the north part of the country. The leaders of Israel drew near to the Lord with their mouths, yet their hearts were far removed from him. It was their duty to teach the people God’s Word of truth; but they did not do so. The common people had been told to expect a king; and when they heard Jesus they would have made him king by force, had he not prevented them. (John 6:15) When he offered himself as King at the time he rode on the ass int-<sup>1 </sup>the city of Jerusalem, the ruling class rejected him. “Both the houses [or parts] of Israel” stumbled over Christ as the Messiah and King. Only a remnant of Israel believed on the Lord Jesus as the Christ and remained faithful. This was a miniature or first fulfilment of the prophecy.—Rom. 9: 32, 33; 11: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the day of Pentecost, when the holy spirit was poured out upon the first members of the church of Christ, to the second coming of the Lord the gospel was preached, and many heard and believed. These divided into two houses or companies. The clergy organized a system of religion called the “Christian religion”, and in that system the politicians, military leaders, and the rich have always been “the principal of the flock”. A great many joined themselves to the church, but, because they were poor and unlearned, they were kept in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, in eighteen hundred and seventy-eight, when the Lord began the work of restoring the fundamental truths of the Bible to his people, many came away from the denominational church systems and came together for the study of the Word of the Lord and to build each other up in the most holy faith. These formed the other spiritual house of Israel. In this house two parts were made manifest: first, the leaders in the church who concluded that by reason of their learning and position in the church they were entitled to more favor and to places of honor; the others, those who loved the truth, looked forward to the time when they would be ready to go to heaven and be taken to the Lord. In both branches there have been some who really loved God and who have therefore stood the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s anointed King, The Stone, was laid in the complete sense in nineteen hundred and eighteen when he came to his temple and offered himself as King. Thereafter the stumbling took place. “Organized Christianity” is called the nominal Christian systems. In nineteen hundred and eighteen those systems rejected Christ as King and substituted the League of Nations arrangement for it. They therefore stumbled over the Stone and fell. To those who had come out of the denominational systems, and who had seen and accepted the evidences of the Lord’s presence, there came a great test or fiery trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of these rejected the proof of the Lord’s invisible presence, that he had begun his reign and that he had come to his temple, and they fell away. Those who withstood the test and came through the fiery trial and were refined, are those who make up “the remnant”. These became a part of the organization of the Lord. The others are turned aside. Therefore the physical facts show the stumbling of both houses of Israel and a remnant remaining. The test of nineteen hundred and eighteen is another proof that the Lord came to his temple and was laid as the chief corner stone in completion at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In prophecy the expression “in that day” is often used, and has particular reference to the period of time when the Lord is building up Zion, his organization, particularly the earthly members of that organization. “That day” is the Lord’s day, because it is the time or period beginning when the Lord God placed his King upon his throne and sent him forth to build up Zion. In proof of this, note the words of God’s prophet in Psalm one hundred and eighteen, verses nineteen and twenty, reading: “Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the Lord Jesus was placed upon his throne in nineteen hundred and fourteen (Ps. 2:6), the kingdom there began to function, and therefore the way of ingress was opened, as represented by ‘ ‘ the gates ’ ’, and through these gates into God’s organization the righteous would enter. In this connection the prophet says: “I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.” (Ps. 118:21) This part of the prophecy particularly applies when the Lord brought his approved ones on earth under the robe of righteousness, and gave them the garments of salvation by which they are identified as a part of God’s organization. Then the prophet proceeds (Ps. 118: 22), saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.” God’s anointed King, Jesus, is presented to the professed people of God, and is rejected by many, but is gladly accepted by the remnant. The latter see and appreciate the great truth that the Lord is now in his holy temple, and therefore they say: “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (Ps. 118:23,24) By this prophecy, which Jesus quoted and applied to himself, “that day” is definitely and certainly fixed. It is “the day” in which the Lord God begins to work through Christ Jesus to vindicate his name, and therefore it is the Lord’s day.—Ps. 110: 2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the examination of prophecy, when the words “in that day” appear in the prophecy, the student may fix the time of the beginning of the fulfilment thereof. Having once fixed the time meant by the expression ‘ ‘ in that day ’ ’, he may know that the prophecy could not be fulfilled until after the beginning of “that day” in nineteen hundred and fourteen, so far as the King is concerned, and that it could not be fulfilled until after nineteen hundred and eighteen so far as the faithful associates of the Lord Jesus are concerned. The temple class then begin to realize that there is a fight between the ‘seed of the woman’ and the ‘seed of the serpent’; and, having a great desire to be faithful to the Lord and be victorious, with zeal and joy they pray in the words of the prophecy (Ps. 118:25,26): “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus merely a remnant out of all the multitudes of professed Christians in “Christendom” accept and advertise God’s precious Stone as King now invisibly present to rule; whereas the self-appointed ‘empire builders’ in “Christendom” reject that true Head Stone of the corner and proceed with their own vain and selfish schemes of world government.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>BEGINNING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">E</span><span class="font3">VENTS without parallel in human history have passed before the eyes of the present generation. Even more unusual things are taking place from day to day. All of these things, as the Scriptures show, are moving toward a majestic climax, foretold centuries ago in prophecies which Jehovah caused to be written and which he has preserved to this day for the instruction and encouragement of those who now live upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When prophecy is written or uttered, seldom if ever is the time of the fulfilment of that prophecy definitely stated or indicated. Prophecy means the foretelling of what will come to pass at some future time. There is a way to definitely determine when that prophecy is fulfilled, and God has provided that way. If events come to pass or facts are made known which fit exactly the terms of the prophecy, then we may know that the time that these events come to pass is the time for the fulfilment of that prophecy. These events thus coming to pass, and fitting the terms of the prophecy, are called the physical facts. Anyone who reads prophecy, and then observes the physical facts which fit exactly with that which is prophesied,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>OF SORROWS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">may properly interpret the prophecy as being fulfilled at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a great prophecy spoken by Jesus only a few days before his crucifixion. That prophecy must have a fulfilment at some future time. Now the physical facts that have come to pass, and which exactly fit the terms of the prophecy, show that the prophecy spoken by him has been fulfilled. Anyone reading that prophecy, and then knowing the physical facts and applying the same to the prophecy, can see the fulfilment of that prophecy. It will be found that the fulfilment of the prophecy spoken by the Lord Jesus exactly corroborates the two lines of testimony concerning the “Gentile times”, and shows that his prophecy began to have its fulfilment in 1914. It also marks that 1914 is the date when he “whose right it is” to reign should take his power and authority and begin his reign and begin his operations to oust Satan from the rule over the world. The beginning of that time is designated by the Lord Jesus as “the beginning of sorrows” upon the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the prophets had foretold the fact of the establishment of God’s kingdom of righteousness. The disciples of Jesus were familiar with those prophecies. In addition thereto Jesus had taught them of the coming government or kingdom of righteousness. He had told them that it would not come until the end of the world over which Satan reigned as prince. He had told them that he would come again and receive them unto himself and that they should share with him his kingdom or government of righteousness. With these things in the minds of his disciples, it is easily to be seen why they were keenly interested concerning his coming and the end of the world. They came to Jesus privately and propounded to him this question: ‘ ‘ Tell us, when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” (Matt. 24:3) The answer of Jesus indicated that there would be a long period of time that would elapse before that day of his coming and the end of the world. Necessarily the end of the world would mark the time when he would take his power and begin his reign. Then he told his disciples what should be observed by his followers on earth at the beginning of that period of time. He did not tell them to look into the skies for some manifestation of visible power. He told them the events that would be coming to pass upon the earth that could be readily seen by all persons. He said: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The year nineteen fourteen (A.D.) saw the opening or beginning of the very events Jesus there mentioned. Many wars had come and gone before that time; but with the war of 1914 nation rose against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, the like of which had never before come to pass. It is important also to notice that the principal ones involved in that war were those nations which claimed to be “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. The nations that had established a religion, and given it the misnomer “Christian religion”, in 1914 became involved in the most deadly conflict of time. What did it mean ? It marked the end of the time when Satan would be permitted to rule the nations of the earth without interference. Of course Jesus knew that the beginning of that time would be marked by a war, because Satan would then become angry and he would cause the nations over which he ruled to become angry. Subsequently Christ Jesus gave to one of his disciples, John, a revelation of what should come to pass at that time. He said: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True to the prophecy of Jesus, 1914 did mark “the beginning of sorrows”. It was the beginning of a sorrowful time for Satan and his rule and the beginning of great sorrows upon the peoples over which he had long been the invisible ruler. The World War brought the greatest sorrow that has ever befallen the nations of earth. It was accompanied, as Jesus foretold, with a great pestilence that really took away in death more people than were killed in the war. Shortly thereafter in the wake of the war came a devastating famine during which millions of people died of starvation. There have been more earthquakes experienced since 1914 than ever before in the history of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that Jesus declared that the things above mentioned would constitute “the beginning of sorrows” shows that other sorrows would follow. It has been even so. The advocates of the World War insisted that the war would so clear the governmental atmosphere that everlasting peace and quiet would follow among the people and that contentment and prosperity would be their lot. That which has actually come to pass has been exactly contrary to those predictions. Jesus said it would be as it is. Instead of the World War’s bringing prosperity and being followed by desirable conditions, Jesus said that then there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth”.—Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some time after the World War the president of the United States, discussing conditions of distress in the world, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“These are days of great perplexity, when a great cloud hangs over the world. It seems as if great blind material forces had been released which had for long been held in leash and restraint.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the war ended distress continues; and now a decade and more after the war every nation of earth is in perplexity, and the people in distress, and fear has taken hold upon them all. They are in trepidation as to what the future holds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In further fulfilment of the prophecy stated by Jesus concerning the end of the world true Christians during the World War were persecuted because they would not violate their conscience and God’s command by engaging in the killing of their fellow man. The hatred of all nations involved in the war was directed against such. (Matt. 24:9) Many who have claimed to be Christians manifested, and continue to manifest, hatred toward each other and to betray their brethren, as the Lord foretold. (Matt. 24:10) These are additional sorrows. Many false prophets have arisen to deceive the people; and particularly among these are the clergy who since 1914 have openly denied God and denied that he would ever establish a righteous government on the earth. (Matt. 24:11) Another part of that prophecy was: “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” (Matt. 24:12) Iniquity means lawlessness. There never has been a time of such lawlessness against God and his righteousness as now, and that in countries claiming to be Christian.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>GOOD HOPES FOR 1933-1934</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God is privileged to participate in this work. Since the organization of the Society the work during the year has always been outlined in proportion as the Lord provided the money through his consecrated children. We continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appreciates the fact that this blessing came to him as a gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privileges of using time, energy, and money in telling the message to others. Some who are doing as much house-to-house witness work as their conditions allow are also blessed with some money which they desire to use in the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls which they cannot personally reach might be fed upon the precious kingdom-gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used in the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much, enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon receipt of this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">kindly write two cards, exactly alike. One of these put aside for your own record of what you have promised; the other send to us. Or, if you prefer, put it in the form of a letter, keeping a copy of the letter for your own convenience. We suggest that it be brief and that nothing be written except the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace I hope to be able to give to his work for spreading the gospel during the ensuing year the amount of $------------- I will remit in such amounts and at</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">such times as I can find convenient, according as the Lord prospers me. (Signed)__</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kindly address this card to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, </span><span class="font3">Financial Department, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren residing outside of the United States should write their respective offices in the countries where they reside, and remit their “Good Hopes” to such offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of our own selves we can do nothing, but we are assured that the prayers of the righteous avail much. Hence we ask the brethren to present us daily before the throne of heavenly grace, that we may be given wisdom and grace to use the money to the best advantage in spreading the gospel to the Lord’s glory, and to do the work entrusted to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 141) </span><span class="font3">given by the great prophecy of Jesus above quoted, the physical facts coming to pass since 1914 would prove beyond a doubt that that year marked the great turning point in the affairs of men. The indisputable testimony establishes beyond a doubt that 1914 marks the beginning of the time mentioned by God’s prophet when he would give the rulership to him “whose right it is”. There is no other explanation of the conditions now existing on earth. God’s purpose is that the people who seek for the truth shall learn from these events that the day of their deliverance is at hand and that soon his righteous government shall be available for their benefit and blessings.—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>

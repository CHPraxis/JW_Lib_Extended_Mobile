<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in. glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has been the custom of the Society for the Bethel home and the factory at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, to close two weeks during each year so as to allow the brethren a change from their steady occupation. The period during which everything will be shut down this year is August 21 to September 4 inclusive. Many are arranging to spend the greater part of their time in the witness work in the vicinity where they are going. During these two weeks no orders will be filled or correspondence answered. All companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters should make a careful check of their stock so that they will ha\e sufficient on hand during this period and for several weeks thereafter. The Society will appreciate it very much if correspondence that is not urgent be not written until sometime after September 4, so that the mail that lias accumulated during the closed-factory period can be dispatched promptly upon reopening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE FOR THE BLIND</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Is God!</span><span class="font2"> is now ready, in Braille, for the blind. This booklet is procurable at a cost of $1.00 a copy, but may be had on loan bv all blind readers. Apply to the Society's branch for the blind, 1210 Spear St., Logansport, Ind. Jehovah’s witnesses may well bring this to the attention of blind persons whom they encounter in their house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gog is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font2"> angry concerning the kingdom message that is being broadcast by radio, and is making a desperate effort to stop the same. It seems clear that Jehovah has provided the transcription machines for the very purpose of checking the enemy’s efforts. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses are now provided with these machines and are using them in halls, parks and other public places with telling effect. Three hundred machines are already provided for America, and Canada and England have a proportionately good number. These are a part of the equipment for making known the kingdom. For particulars, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REMITTANCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosing coin or currency with an order for books or other publications often results in disappointment when the sender is notified that neither order nor remittance has been received by us. In this day of disturbed financial conditions even the use of checks involves a needless risk. We suggest that every one use the money order (either postal or express). Keep each money order receipt for reference. For all remittances the money order should be made payable to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, with a memorandum attached as to how much is desired for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> or for anything else.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS SANCTUARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And Jie said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary he cleansed.” —Dan. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S sanctuary class must be clean; as it is written: ‘ ‘ Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52:11) The context shows beyond all question of doubt that this prophecy above, quoted from Isaiah, applies to the remnant of God now on the earth. These are described therein as ‘the feet of him [The Christ] that bringeth good tidings of good, and publisheth peace’, and who continue to sing out joyfully the message: ‘God reigneth; the kingdom is here.’ They are described as “beautiful” because of their complete devotion to Jehovah and his kingdom. They are designated as Jehovah’s “watchman”, at complete unity, and as that they are continually lifting up the voice in testimony and in singing praises to the Most High. They are commanded to sing because ‘Jehovah hath comforted them’, and this he does by giving them an understanding of his prophecies, which were written aforetime, and are now due to be understood. These are chosen vessels of Jehovah, bearing the message of his kingdom to the people of good will and serving notice upon the rulers of earth that they must get out and stay out for ever. It is a holy work, completely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, and those who have part therein must see to it that they touch no unclean thing. Each one must be clean.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah sent his beloved Son to the temple for judgment in 1918, and the very purpose of that judgment is announced to be to “purify the sons of Levi [the priestly servant class] ” and to “purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto [Jehovah] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font3">offering in righteousness”. (Mal. 3:3) That offering is service of praise to Jehovah God and his King, and which must be done continually: “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” (Heb. 13:15) It follows, then, that before the final testimony of Jehovah is given that sanctuary must be cleansed. All things that defile must be removed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEANING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> All honest persons should be clean of body and mind, and their course of action should be clean and virtuous. There are some in the world who earnestly strive to be that very thing, yet who make no pretense of being the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Then there are others who have made a consecration to do the will of God who think to bring themselves to the point of perfection by doing what they call “character development”. The ‘cleansing of the sanctuary’ has a far deeper meaning than that. It is written: “Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Cor. 7:1) That kind of cleansing each one of the consecrated must do for himself, whereas the cleansing of the sanctuary is done by Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s executive agent. The cleansing of the sanctuary relates to the body of Christ collectively. Israel, being the covenant people of Jehovah, pictured those who are in covenant with Jehovah now by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. It is written in the law: “Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him.” (Num. 19:13) Satan’s organization is a dead body, and every part of it is under judgment of destruction. Anyone in the covenant with Jehovah and having responded to the call for the kingdom must be completely separated from Satan 's organization and remain separate in order to be clean, and must be wholly devoted to Jehovah God. There can be no compromise with Satan’s organization, nor can anyone of God’s approved ones have anything in common with that organization. (2 Cor. 6:15-18) The cleansing of the sanctuary, therefore, must mean the complete separation of all of God’s people from those of Satan’s organization. Only the cleansed can offer an acceptable sacrifice unto Jehovah. (Mal. 3: 3) Therefore the cleansing of the sanctuary must mean the removing from that company once in line for the kingdom every one who is not wholly devoted to God. It is the shaking out of the disapproved, that the approved ones may be manifest.—Heb. 12:27.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">211</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">‘When Jesus Christ appeared first at the typical temple in Jerusalem he “cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple(Matt. 21:12) When he appears at the real temple for judgment all those who are amongst the commercial element, and who claim to be consecrated, and who use the gospel of God’s Word for commercial purposes, either directly or indirectly, would necessarily be gathered out or driven out. This would include all the clergymen and the principal ones of their flock who use the Word of God for selfish purposes. It would also include the “man of sin” and all those who seek personal gain by the use of the message of the kingdom. All who refuse to boldly take their stand against Satan’s organization </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font3">who put on the soft pedal and sanctimoniously refuse to speak against the Devil's organization would necessarily be taken out. Also those who murmur against the Lord and his work, finding fault, and who are in opposition thereto, do so for selfish reasons, having a desire for personal gain; and all such would necessarily be gathered out. All who seek men to follow them and who set snares to catch men in, and those who pursue a course contrary to God’s commandments, are moved so to do for selfish gain, and they would be gathered out. Also those “having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage” are gathered out. (Jude 16) All abominable ones are gathered out, because Jesus says: “That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” (Luke 16:15) “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” (Rev. 21:8,27) Only those who are cleansed are permitted to enter the temple. “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Rev. 22:14) Jehovah’s purpose is to have for himself a people who are wholly and unselfishly devoted to him and who serve him with joy in connection with the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">END</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The last preceding issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> dealing with the prophecy of Daniel, chapters seven and eight, clearly establish the fact, beyond all question of doubt, that it is the “little horn”, meaning the seventh world power, which had its beginning with little England and which is now more particularly known under the title of Anglo-American imperialistic system, which is “Christendom”, that is the instrument that the Devil uses to oppose the kingdom, to take away the “continual sacrifice” and to tread down the people of God. It also shows that this taking away of the continual offering takes place after the beginning of the “time of the end”; and it is in connection with the taking away of the “daily sacrifice”, and the abomination of desolation, and the treading down of the sanctuary class, that the matter concerning the cleansing of the sanctuary is discussed, and as to when it must take place. It would therefore be entirely foreign to the prophecy to conclude that the cleansing of the sanctuary took place in A.D. 18-13 by the formation of the Evangelical Alliance, which alliance was a part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The cleansing of the temple means the complete separating work, that the ones approved by the Lord may be made to appear and to perform service in righteousness. When, then, is such separating work done ? All the scriptures show that this is done by the Lord Jesus after he comes to the temple for judgment, at which time he is accompanied by his holy angels. (Matt. 25:31) It is then that his words apply: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.” (Matt. 13:41) This work takes place at the time of judgment at the temple; therefore it was impossible for it to have been fulfilled prior to that time. The Lord Jesus appeared at his temple in 1918, and the cleansing of the temple could not begin before that time, and necessarily would be accomplished after that time. The explanation of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the time of the cleansing of the temple, and which was published prior to 1918, is therefore merely a guess and could not be correct, for the reason that man does not interpret prophecy. In the year 1929 the Lord gave to his people an understanding of the “days of Daniel” as set forth in the twelfth chapter of that prophecy, and at that time an effort was made earnestly to ascertain the meaning of the twenty-three hundred days of Daniel 8:14; but it v as found to be impossible to get an understanding of it then, and the manifest reason is that God’s due time to understand it had not then arrived. The facts now well known to exist are here submitted in connection with the prophecy as explained in this and preceding issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and the readers are invited to apply these facts to the Scriptures and to determine for themselves whether or not the explanation here published is correct and in harmony with the will of God. The people of God have the assurance that all who are born of his organization are taught of God and have great peace. (Isa. 54:13) This text could have its application only after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. We may with confidence therefore expect that those who are devoted to Jehovah, and who are his children, will receive from his gracious hands an understanding of the prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2300 DAYS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> According to the proof set forth in the December 15 (1929) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> the “days”, or time, clearly appear to be literal, and not symbolic; hence the reader is referred to that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font3"> for the proof that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">“days of Daniel” are literal and are to be calculated as such, and are not symbolic. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1929, page 372, paragraph 9) The prophecy of Daniel does not say that the cleansing of the sanctuary will be completed twenty-three hundred days after it begins, but that it is to be accomplished twenty-three hundred days after a certain fixed time, which is to be determined, of course, from the prophecy itself. The question propounded by one saint to another was this: “How long shall be the vision concerning the daily [continual] sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?” (Dan. 8:13) The question propounded did not ask, How long until the sanctuary shall be cleansed? There is nothing in the question about the cleansing of the sanctuary, but the question asked is, “How long shall be the vision concerning the [continual] sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation [making desolate, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin], </span><span class="font3">to give both the sanctuary and the host to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trodden urder foot?”</span><span class="font3"> Only part of the question is answered in verse fourteen, and that answer relates specifically to the time that must elapse from the existence of two things simultaneously, to wit, the taking away of the continual sacrifice and the transgression of desolation; and the answer in substance is that <sup>1</sup> from the taking away of the continual sacrifice and [committing of] the transgression that maketh desolate shall be 2,300 days’. The emphasis here must be on the words “transgression of desolation”, because both the act of taking away of the continual sacrifice and the act of transgression must exist at the time of the beginning of the twenty-three-hundred-day period, at the end of which the cleansing is accomplished. The important matter now to do, therefore, is to determine what is meant by the words ‘the transgression that maketh desolate’, and when did that “transgression” begin or take place; and from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that time the </span><span class="font3">twenty-three-hundred-day period must begin to count. Otherwise stated, the abomination that maketh desolate </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and the transgression</span><span class="font3"> must both exist at the time the twenty-three-hundred-day period begins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> “Transgression” means a ‘revolt, or rebellion’, that is to say, a willful violation of God’s law. The willful disobedience of God’s law is sin. Paul, a member of the supreme court of Palestine, and a strict Pharisee, wrote under inspiration of God’s spirit after he had become a true follower of Christ Jesus these words: “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” (Rom. 7:7) That means that the responsibility for rebellion or transgression attaches to the wrongdoer completely from the time that the wrong is committed and the wrongdoer receives knowledge that the wrongful act so committed is a violation of God’s law. One might do wrong and not know that it was a violation of God’s law at the time; but when this knowledge is brought home to him the responsibility particularly attaches from that time forward. The Devil has made the rule that ignorance of the law excuses no man; but God’s law is more liberal, and he holds men responsible only after they have received knowledge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> The Anglo-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, so called, and which had its beginning with the “little horn” in little England, is that power that did set up the League of Nations in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ and which is “the abomination” in the sight of Jehovah God. The spiritual advisers of that world-power system, to wit, the clergy, had advised the ruling powers of “Christendom” that the League of Nations is “the political expression of God's kingdom on earth”. The commercial and political elements of the world-power organization, without receiving further knowledge, might have raised the point, and earnestly contended for it, that they relied upon the clergymen to advise them; and that since they had been advised that the League of Nations is the political expression of God’s kingdom they had every reason to believe that God approved that League, and hence in setting it up there was no willful violation of God’s law, or rebellion. Jehovah will not permit these agents of the Devil to make any such argument and be able to rely upon it. Both prophecy and the facts show that Jehovah ,vould afford them no such excuse, but that he would bring knowledge directly home to the ruling factors, that their mouths might be for ever estopped to say that they acted innocently. It was in 1919, the end of January, that the abominable League of Nations was set up by the Anglo-American empire system. It was earlier than that, to wit, 1918, that Jehovah’s sanctuary class or devoted people were “cast down” and the “continual sacrifice” of service was taken away. What came to pass after the taking away of the continual sacrifice, and after the setting up of the League of Nations, that brought notice to the seventh world power that the League was and is an abomination in the sight of Jehovah God? Was there any notice given to that world power concerning this abominable thing which had been set up, and that would fix the responsibility completely upon that part of Satan’s organization ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The answer to that question appears in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> issue of July 15, 1926, beginning on page 211. Jehovah uses his covenant people, and then lets them know why they were so used. He used his covenant people to serve notice on the seventh world power in fulfilment of this prophecy of Daniel, and none of his anointed people knew at the time that they had anything to do with the fulfilment of the prophecy here considered; nor could they know it until later, because the facts had not entirely come to pass fulfilling the prophecy. At the time above mentioned </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font3">assembled in the city of London, England, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">convention of Jehovah’s people, at which time a resolution was adopted at the head of which appears this: &quot;A TESTIMONY TO THE RULERS OF THE WORLD”; and which testimony was notice served upon the seventh-world-power rulers and setting forth that the League of Nations is not the expression of God’s kingdom on earth, and that therefore the clergy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">“Christendom” were liars, had deceived their allies, the rulers of the world, and hence were then and now are the agents of Satan. From that time forward the rulers could have no excuse to say that they had no knowledge that the League of Nations is an abomination in the sight of God. That resolution, together with the address publicly delivered at the earthly headquarters, or “seat”, of government of the seventh world power and within the walls of the 'Royal Hall’, so named, brought to the attention of the rulers of “Christendom” that Satan is the god of this world, that the world had ended, that the League of Nations is Satan’s makeshift and is a fraud, and that it and all “Christendom” would soon fall in the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and that Jehovah’s kingdom is the only hope of the world.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Among other things in that notice this appeared: “And contrary to the Word of God the commercial, political and ecclesiastical rulers attempted to stabilize the world and keep the peoples under control by adopting that makeshift which is called the League </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Nations and which was wrongfully and blasphemously hailed as the political expression of God’s king</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dom </span><span class="font3">on earth; that the real author and father of the League of Nations compact is Satan the Devil, the god of this evil world, and it was put forward by him as his last desperate effort to deceive the peoples, turn them away from the true God, and hold them under his own wicked control. ...

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">” The </span><span class="font3">day following the reading of this resolution to the public and the delivery of the supporting address </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily News</span><span class="font3"> of London, one of the leading newspapers, carried a full report of both the resolution and the public address; the regular circulation of that paper at that time was 800,000 copies per day, and in addition thereto many extra copies were printed and distributed. That convention therefore was notice to the rulers of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, and that fixes the time of the beginning of “the transgression” mentioned by the prophet Daniel in 8:13, because from that time the rulers had notice in their own place of operation. Printing the notice in their own press for ever precludes them from denying that they had received service. “Christendom,” meaning the Anglo-American empire imperialism, not only failed to give heed to that testimony and notice, but treated the same with contempt and continued to tread down Jehovah’s anointed people and to set itself up in opposition to God and to his kingdom. Be it noted that the prophecy does not say that the abomination that maketh desolate and the treading down of the host and the sanctuary will end at the end of the twenty-three hundred days. The only thing it does say is that the sanctuary will be cleansed at that time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The London convention of Jehovah’s witnesses began on the 25th day of May, 1926, at and during which convention the resolution was brought forward and adopted and published. Since the Lord acts by and through his devoted people on earth who serve as his witnesses, the resolution should properly be considered as a notification from the Lord to the rulers of the world. In the absence of specific directions to the contrary the Bible method of calculating the time of the twenty-three hundred days should be followed, which method is by lunar time. Other methods of calculating time are according to the organization of this world, Satan’s organization. According to the Bible method of counting the twenty-three hundred days the actual time is six years, four months, and twenty days. Beginning to count from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">transgression</span><span class="font3"> resulting by reason of the League of Nations, and the giving of notice, which must begin May 25, 1926, the twenty-three hundred days, or six years, four months, and twenty days, would end October 15, 1932. Shall we find any evidence showing that the cleansing of the sanctuary took place at that time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> It is certain that the cleansing of the temple, which is the house of God, began when Christ Jesus appeared at the temple and began judgment. (1 Pet. 4:17) Those who at that time and during judgment were found disqualified would then be set aside and cast out. (Matt. 24:48-51) All this cleansing work is done by the Lord, the great Judge, his orders being carried out by his angels who stand guard at the entrance of the temple. Those who by reason of their course of action placed themselves in the “man of sin” class would be separated and turned away from the temple as workers of iniquity and offenders. All the professed followers of Christ Jesus, particularly the clergy of “Christendom” and the principal ones of their flock, by reason of their rebellion following the service of notice aforegoing would be for ever barred from the sanctuary class. The time must come when all who used the temple or organization of God to accomplish any selfish or personal service for personal gain must be gathered out, for the reason that the sanctuary class must be clean at the end of the fixed time in order that a strenuous, positive righteous offering of sacrifice and praise might be presented before Jehovah God. What, then, took place at the end of the twenty-three-hundred-day period?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup> The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> issues of August 15 and September 1,1932, brought before God’s people the Scriptural proof that the office of “elective elder’’, chosen or selected by vote of creatures, does not Scripturally exist, and that therefore the selection of elders by such means should end. As soon as this information got to the companies action was taken to organize their work and'exclude all “elective” offices such as elder and deacon. It is well known that during the history of the church almost all the trouble arising amongst God’s people has been due to the influence of “heady men” in the church who held the elective position of elder and who insisted on lording it over God’s people. It has been this class of men who have hindered the remnant and have opposed their “continual sacrifice”, that is to say, the daily service unto Jehovah and his kingdom. (Heb. 13:15) It has been that class who have opposed in the various companies the organization that the Lord is using, and have denounced the Society as a book-selling scheme. Most of these men have insisted that because of their office as elected elder they were entitled to special consideration and to them exclusively belonged the right to direct what should be done in the class or company. They have desired to receive the plaudits of other creatures and thus for selfish gain have insisted on occupying a more honorable position than others. Surely the sanctuary could not be wholly clean until all such are removed and until there is a complete unity amongst all the members of the sanctuary class. The issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in 1932, above mentioned, suggested a method of organization for service. Many of the companies immediately began organization for service according to the manner suggested. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of October 15, 1932. there is published a resolution which had been adopted and which is therefore the official announcement of the Lord through his channel of communication of the proper method of organization. Between September and the fifteenth of October practically all the companies of God’s people throughout the land had organized along this line. This, then, is the authoritative announcement from the people of the Lord, and therefore from the Lord through his people, that the elective office of elder has ended and that all who are in the temple, and therefore in full unity with the Lord Jesus, and anointed are by virtue of their maturity in Christ elders, within the meaning of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Scriptures. The above resolution appearing in the publication October 15, 1932, marks exactly the end of the twenty-three-hundred-day period. Now let each one of the anointed consider the prophecy and the facts and determine for himself whether or not the foregoing is the Scriptural explanation of the twenty-three-hundred-day period. If such is found to be correct, then this is an additional reason why God’s people should continue to rejoice and be glad, having this further evidence that the Lord is guiding their every action so long as they are faithful and true to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRODDEN DOWN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> The “abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet”, still stands in the “holy place”, that is to say, still claims to be the Lord’s way of ruling the world, and will so stand until destroyed by the power of Jehovah. The question propounded to Daniel, in chapter 8:13, makes mention of the ‘ ‘ sanctuary and the host” being trodden under foot. Manifestly the words “sanctuary” and “host” there used are limited to those of the faithful remnant yet on earth and who are continually opposed by Satan and his organization because of their faithfulness in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17) The Scriptures do not indicate that the class “trodden under foot” will be released and freed at the end of the twenty-three hundred days; and there is no reason to conclude that their freedom from persecution would exist at the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary. The very opposite is to be expected. Jesus explains the reason why the answer, given in Daniel 8:14, to the question propounded is limited to the cleansing of the sanctuary. That part of the sanctuary class on earth is composed of the faithful remnant ; and Satan’s organization, particularly that part of it known as the Anglo-American empire system, or “Christendom”, will continue to oppose these faithful witnesses of Jehovah until the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Then it is that Jehovah, as the Scriptures declare, goes forth and fights against the nations, in which fight Jehovah will be victorious; and at that time the faithful remnant, who previously “shall not be cut off” from his organization, will thereafter be completely freed, and for ever delivered by the hand of God’s great executive officer, Christ Jesus, who leads in that fight.—Zech. 14: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The Hebrew word translated “cleanse” in Daniel 8:14 is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tsadaq,</span><span class="font3"> and this text is the only place where the word is so translated. Other places the same word is rendered “be just”, “be justified,” “be righteous,” “justify,” “do justice/’ “turn to righteousness,” “clear selves.” Thus the word means vindication and victory for the right. That proves that the remnant takes a positive and unequivocal position on the side of Jehovah and is wholly devoted to him and his kingdom and is thus proved right. It follows that Jehovah would permit no one to be of that class who is in any wise out of harmony with the kingdom and its work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The cleansing takes place at the time the temple class is brought into the temple and into full unity with Christ Jesus. It is this faithful remnant class that Jehovah makes his witnesses and that must thereafter give a clear and unequivocal testimony to the name and honor of Jehovah God. It is this class that he uses to serve notice upon Satan’s organization before he destroys it. The time must come to finally and for ever settle the great issue, and Jehovah God will have notice plainly served upon all who make any claim to or pretend to have any scheme for the welfare of man, or who hold to any god besides Jehovah, that he is God. He uses his witnesses to serve such notice, and therefore says to them: “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things [things yet before us] ? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[tsadaq,</span><span class="font3"> Hebrew] : or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.” (Isa. 43:9,10) “Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come: and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel [God’s chosen people] be justified, and shall glory.”—Isa. 45: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Daniel the prophet did not understand the full meaning of the vision and he bemoaned the fact that ‘the sanctuary is desolate’. “Now, therefore, 0 our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.” (Dan. 9:17) God told Daniel that the word of the prophecy could not be understood “till the time of the end”, at which time there shall stand up the “great Prince”, which is Christ Jesus the King. (Dan. 12:1, 9) The date of the “time of the end” begins with October, 1914, when Christ Jesus was installed as King on Mount Zion, or God’s organization. Then the Lord told Daniel that at the time of the end “many shall be purified, and made white, and tried”. (Dan. 12: 10) This corresponds exactly with the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment in 1918. (Mal. 3:1-3) That marks the beginning of the separating work, or the beginning of the cleansing of the temple, and the promise is that “none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand” the prophecy. The cleansing of the sanctuary class shall be completed twenty-three hundred days after “the transgression”, and not twenty-three hundred days after the beginning of judgment. The reason given by Jesus for a certain class’ not understanding is that they are workers of iniquity, that is to say, lawless, and hence they would'be gathered out and cast into outer darkness and have their portion with the hypocrites.—Matt. 13:41; 24:51; 25: 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The wise are those who hear and obey the Lord and receive his approval. The prophet of God inquired: “How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?” (Dan. 12:6) Daniel was then told that it would be “for a time, times, and an half”, which is equivalent to three and one-half years, or 1,260 days, according to the Biblical method of counting time; and that the end of that period of time or “the end of these wonders” would be marked by ‘scattering of the holy people of God’. (Dan. 12:7) The end of Satan’s rule without interruption and the beginning of the rule of Christ Jesus mark definitely the time of the end, which time was October 1, 1914. Just three and one-half years, or 1,260 days, thereafter Jehovah’s holy people were scattered, to wit, in the beginning of April, 1918. That marks the time of the end of strange things, or “wonders”, and the time for the beginning of the understanding, because the Lord Jesus had now come to the temple. Clearly this means that an understanding of the prophecy of Daniel could not be had before 1918, and the facts show that no man on earth did understand it untd after that time. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1929, pages 371-373.) Since that date only “the wise” have understood the beginning of the kingdom and other like great truths, which Jehovah has taught his people. It was these who did understand that were first tried, purified and made white, and thus proved; and this must be done before they could understand and before they could offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Further showing the time for the fulfilment of this prophecy Jehovah’s messenger informed Daniel: “And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (Dan. 12:11) The 1,290-day period is equal to three years and seven months and the beginning is marked by two things’ existing at the same time, to wit, ‘The taking away of the continual sacrifice, and the setting up of the abomination that maketh desolate. ’ As herein shown the taking away of the continual offering or sacrifice was accomplished by the seventh world power, or “Christendom”, in the spring of 1918; and the setting up of the League of Nations, “the abomination that maketh desolate” because it stands in the place or stead of God’s kingdom, occurred at the end of January, 1919; therefore the latter date marks the beginning of the 1,290-day period; and counting three years and seven months from that time would necessarily bring the end thereof to the beginning of September, 1922. At this latter date the angel of the Lord sounded the first “trumpet” and poured out the first “vial” upon the earth, and in which “the holy people” of God on earth had a part. It was at that time that God’s faithful people announced the King at the temple, and this was done by a resolution declaring that Jehovah is the only true God, that Christ Jesus is the King, and the kingdom has begun, and that the League of Nations is the product of the Devil. That resolution and the accompanying argument adopted at the Cedar Point convention in 1922 was published and sent forth by millions to the people all over “Christendom”. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1922, pages 324, 331; 1929, page 374; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 106.) These facts appear clearly to be in fulfilment of the prophecy of Daniel 12:11 with relation to the 1,290 days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Then Jehovah’s Messenger said to Daniel: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. ’ ’ (Dan. 12:12) The end of the 1,290-day period marks the time of great encouragement to the people of God, and with new energy they move forward in the service of Jehovah. The words of the above prophecy show that the end of the 1,335-day period must mark the beginning of a time of special blessings to the anointed people of God on earth. From September, 1922, onward there were many truths revealed to God’s people, which truths revealed give great encouragement to the faithful to push forward with the work; and exactly 1,335 days thereafter, to wit, in the latter part of May, 1926, and to be exact, the 25th day of May that year, Jehovah poured out his blessings upon his people at the London convention, and also at the same time the angel of the Lord poured out the fifth “vial”. (Rev. 16:10; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 137; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 31) That marked the beginning of the time of blessedness to the people of God, and which time shall never end. It also marked the beginning of the time of the counting of the 2,300 days. It was at that time that God’s people saw as never before the fallacy of the doctrine that men, by character development and appearing to be sanctimonious, could thus fit themselves for the kingdom; and they began to put aside all such things said to appear before the Lord honestly and frankly and to depend upon the Lord to make them fit for his kingdom, their part being to faithfully perform their covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The pouring out of the fifth “vial”, and which </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font3">the Testimony to the nations of the world, marked the beginning of the “transgression of desolation” (Dan. 8:13); therefore such was the beginning of the 2,300-day period at the end of which the sanctuary must be cleansed, which fact has been accomplished, as above set forth. The Scriptures and the facts prove that the four periods of time named by Daniel’s prophecy, as above mentioned herein, are literal periods of time, and not symbolic. Furthermore, it is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">shown </span><span class="font3">that these prophecies could not be understood until after the appearing of the Lord Jesus at the temple in 1918 and that then they would be understood only by those completely devoted to and approved by Jehovah and his great Judge, Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> It is to be expected that when the sanctuary is entirely cleansed there would be some claiming to be of God’s organization and yet who oppose the sanctuary class. Since the October 15 (1932) issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> some who were prior to that time associated with God’s anointed people have come out openly in opposition to the Society and its work that is being carried on at the command of the Lord. The leaders in such opposition are those who until recently were holding the position of “elective elder” in companies of God’s people. Only a few, however, have thus manifested themselves. These opposers at no time have shown any real zeal for the Lord and his kingdom. They have preferred to make speeches and appear wise and let others carry the message of the kingdom to the people. Now they murmur and complain against the Society and the work it carries on in the name of the Lord. This was foretold in God’s Word at Jude 16. This is evidence that such mur-murers and complainers were not approved and taken into the temple and therefore not born of God’s organization, and hence are not taught of God and are not at peace. The leaders in such opposition may influence the weaker ones to follow them; hence mention is made here of such opposition and what should be the attitude of God’s people toward them. (Jude 20-22) The cleansing of the temple necessarily means the setting of the disapproved ones on the side; and there of necessity must be some who are not approved, otherwise there would have been no cleansing work to do. The fact that the church is now at unity means that all must, of course, work together and that those who oppose are out of harmony with Christ and the work of giving testimony concerning God and his kingdom.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1932, pages 259-261.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> To oppose the united action of the remnant in giving testimony of Jehovah and thereby declaring the vengeance of God against the enemy means that such opposers are not in the sanctuary. The very purpose of bringing the church to unity the Scriptures declare to be for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry. (Eph. 4:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Another rendering of this same text is: “In order fully to equip his people for the work of serving.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(.Weymouth)</span><span class="font3"> The cleansing of the temple or sanctuary class prepares a people for this very work. The time rapidly approaches when God will vindicate his name. Before that is done at the battle of the great day of God Almighty he will have a company of true and faithful witnesses to work in full unity and in harmony in giving his testimony. The facts show that there is now just such a company of faithful ones continuing to do such work, and this should greatly encourage them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Some of the Lord’s people have been disturbed because of a falling away of some and the opposition manifested by them, and have been inclined to try to bring back into harmony those who have thus fallen. Such a course is wrong. When Ezekiel’s wife died he was told by the Lord not to mourn. (Ezek. 24:18) This shows that the faithful are not to mourn for the unfaithful, nor to try to get them back into the temple. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, pages 332,333) Those who remain in the sanctuary will appreciate these truths, and no others will. The psalmist saw such, and it troubled him that they could not understand: “When I thought to know this, it was too painful </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> labour in mine eyes] for me, until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.” (Ps. 73:16,17) Let none of the faithful engage in controversies with those who oppose. Let the opposers alone, and let the faithful go on diligently in giving the testimony and doing the work whieh the Lord has put in your hands. Let it be borne in mind that all of God’s children, born of his “woman”, are in his sanctuary and members of his holy family, and all of these are taught of God and have great peace. No others have this blessed privilege, and no </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font3">can give it to them. It is of greatest importance that everyone of the temple class now give close heed to the commandments of Jehovah God’s Great Prophet, Christ Jesus, and be ready at all times to joyfully obey. Those who remain in the sanctuary will at all times be praising and serving Jehovah: “The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discover</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font3">the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 29: 9) “Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.” (Ps. 96: 6) “Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord. The Lord, that made heaven and earth, bless thee out of Zion.” (Ps. 134: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2-, 3) </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s sanctuary is his palace or dwelling place. All those who are in the sanctuary will give </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">heed </span><span class="font3">to his commandment. “Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.” (Ps. 150:1) The Lord has cleansed his sanctuary that his anointed ones may offer unto him continually an offering in righteousness, and by so doing these will maintain their integrity towards Jehovah and have a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> It is to be expected that ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ will continue its cruel opposition to the Lord’s anointed, but this should not in the least discourage them. They now see that it has been this unholy power of Satan that took away their “continual sacrifice”, set up the abomination that maketh desolate, and has trodden down God’s holy people, and that soon Jehovah will take vengeance upon these enemies by completely and for ever destroying that wicked organization. His little handful of cleansed children now on the earth, cleansed by virtue of the fact that they are in Christ and under his leadership, and wholly and unreservedly devoted to him, will go on faithfully proclaiming the testimony, having complete faith and confidence in Jehovah and knowing that in due time he will give complete victory through Christ Jesus, and that his kingdom will for ever vindicate his holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Since the publication of the resolution in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of October 15, 1932, there are some who have for years held the position of “elective elder”, and who still claim to be of the Lord, yet who strenuously oppose the witness work of the Society and object generally to what is being done by the Lord’s organization. Some of these continue in the company of those who are devoted to the work. Does this indicate that the sanctuary was cleansed by October 15, 1932? or that there is yet some cleansing work to be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> Preliminary to the answer to this question, just as this article is being written a letter is received which is similar to other letters received from a few. The writer of the letter has for years been an “elective elder” in a company of the Lord’s people, but has insisted on following his own course. He has objected to every regional service director sent to the company by the Society, and has opposed the local service director, and has done no really zealous active ■work himself; and now since the publication of the resolution above referred to he continues to quote scripture in justification of himself and his course and raises a great noise about the course the Society takes. The earnest and unselfish witnesses of Jehovah of that company have recently organized, as suggested by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and gone forward with the work, leaving this “elective elder” on the side. Following this he wails and gnashes his teeth against the local service director and against the Society and its work. This is mentioned here in order that the answer to the above question, as given by the Lord Jesus Christ, may be understood and appreciated. Concerning the sanctuary and its cleansing Jesus said that he would send forth his angels and gather out the offenders and lawless ones, “and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13:42) It thus appears that after the sanctuary is cleansed those on the outside of the temple will weep, wail and gnash their teeth. Concerning such Jesus says they have been slothful and unprofitable, and he takes away their “talent”. “And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 25: 28-30; Rev. 22:15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> It is then, after the cleansing, that the faithful ones of the temple shine forth as Jehovah’s witnesses, and concerning which Jesus says: “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” (Matt. 13:43) Those of the temple have no occasion or time to weep, but with them it is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">time of joyful service to the praise of Jehovah. (Isa. 12:2-6; Ps. 29:9) Being in the temple, they are taught of God and appreciate the food he gives them.

The faithful, abiding in the temple, shall have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ACTION AGAINST THE ENEMIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">C</span><span class="font3">OMPLETE and permanent relief from the worldwide condition of unrest that now afflicts every nation has been provided for all order-loving peoples of earth by the great Creator, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures make it clear that Satan, although the enemy of God, was permitted to continue in heaven until God’s due time to oust him. It is written, in Job 1, verse six: “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also.” That was written after the flood, and the circumstances seem to indicate beyond doubt that Satan had access to heaven at that time. Associated with Satan in his wicked rule in heaven there has been a host of evil spirits or angels. (Eph. 6:12) Those evil ones together with the Devil have constituted the invisible part of the world exercising power and influence over men and which in his due time God, through Christ, will destroy.—2 Pet. 7-13; 1 John 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long ago God fixed the time at which he would oust Satan from heaven. He knew just when that time would be, and whether he disclosed it to anyone or not is not revealed. The indications from the Scriptures are that he told not even the Lord Jesus; but God himself knew all about it, of course. “Known unto God are all his works, from the b-ginning.” {Acts 15:18) After his resurrection and appearance in heaven Jesus presented himself to Jehovah and God said to him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1) This proves conclusively that God then had determined to throw Satan out of heaven and that Satan for some time thereafter would be at the earth. The earth is God’s footstool. This is plainly stated in Isaiah 66, verse one. The making of Satan the footstool of Jesus meant that God would put him under his feet. Until that time should arrive Jesus must wait. Christ Jesus was at that time clothed with authority and power, and this is indicated by the fact that God said to him: ‘Sit down upon my throne, and at my right hand,’ which meant the position of favor. Jesus himself said that he sat down with his Father on the throne when he ascended on high. Whatever else Christ Jesus did from that time forward he did noth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font3">toward ousting Satan the enemy from heaven until God’s due time arrived. Then we should expect him </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">act exactly in harmony with Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan </span><span class="font3">the enemy was permitted to continue in his nefarious work, and that without let or hindrance, God well knowing that in his own due time he would completely destroy all the wicked works of Satan. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font3">centuries Jesus Christ beheld the arrogance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan and </span><span class="font3">his defiant wickedness against God. He </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">saw </span><span class="font3">him exercising Iris evil influence over the governments, nations and peoples of the earth and turning </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">them away </span><span class="font3">from God. He must have taken note that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan </span><span class="font3">slandered and misrepresented Jehovah and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">persecuted </span><span class="font3">Christians on earth who were faithfully </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">obeying </span><span class="font3">Jehovah’s command; yet amidst all this he must wait. God had a well-defined purpose in having Jesus wait until his own due time before taking action. Paul corroborates the statement of the waiting of Jesus when he says: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; . . . till his enemies be made his foot</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">stool. ’ ’—Heb. 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Manifestly in due time God would call upon his beloved Son to act, and the time of beginning of action would be at the end of the world and at the time when ‘he whose right it is should come’, as God had foretold by his prophet. The proof submitted shows conclusively that that due time was in 1914. When the due time did arrive, the Scriptures show that Jehovah gave command to his beloved Son as Prince and Priest to begin action against Satan, and that marked the “beginning of sorrows”. It is written: “The Lord [Jehovah] shall send the rod [scepter of authority and rightful power reposed in his Son] of thy strength out of Zion [God’s organization] [saying]: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110: 2) At that time Christ Jesus stood up, that is to say, he assumed his power and authority and began action against the enemy; and the action still continues against the enemy, since Satan’s right to exercise power has expired. That time marked the beginning of the battle in heaven by the King of glory, the Son of Jehovah, and his angels on one side, and Satan, otherwise called the old dragon, God’s disloyal son, and his angels on the other side. God would have it understood that it is his fight and that Christ Jesus was leading the fight against the enemy and therefore in due time Jehovah God would make the enemy his footstool. In substance, Jehovah says: ‘This is my fight; I will accomplish this work through my beloved Son.’ Of course the arrogant Satan would not abdicate in heaven; therefore the fight followed. This is corroborated by the prophecy of Daniel wherein it is stated that Michael began his activities against Satan. “Michael” means the ‘Anointed One of God’, which is Christ Jesus. The prophet said: “And at that time [to wit, at the end of the world, in 1914, or the ‘beginning of sorrows’] shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.” (Dan. 12:1) There the time of trouble began in heaven; and at the same time the trouble broke out in the earth. In the heavenly trouble Satan was completely ousted, and the trouble in earth will continue until it culminates in the greatest tribulation ever known, resulting in the complete destruction of Satan’s governments invisible as well as visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Corroborative proof is found in chapter twelve of Revelation. That book is written in symbolic phrase. There the word “woman” is used to symbolize Zion, which is God’s organization and which gives birth to the righteous government, which government is pictured under the symbol “man child”. In the prophecy it is written: “Before she travailed, she brought forth ... a man child.” (Isa. 66:7) This being properly interpreted means that the government was born before the fight began. Necessarily that must be, because the new government must come into existence before it could fight against Satan’s government. In the Revelation picture there appeared unto the true and faithful followers of Christ “a great wonder in heaven”. That does not mean that the Christians saw with their natural eyes; but the faithful students of divine prophecy discerned the great wonder represented by the woman, to wit, God’s organization. The “woman” represents Zion and is “clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars”. This symbolic language means that Zion has the sunlight of God’s Word and truth and walks according to the light, which is symbolized by “the moon”; and “a crown upon her head” symbolizes that Zion, God’s organization, is like a heavenly queen and therefore is fit to bring forth the offspring of Jehovah. Her husband is Jehovah, the King of Eternity. He has made her fruitful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At the same time “another wonder” appeared in </span><span class="font3">heaven, “a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.” (Rev. 12:3) The “great red dragon” is the Devil’s organization. (Rev. 20:1-3) The “seven heads” represent that the evil one has exercised complete invisible power over the nations of earth; -while the “ten horns” symbolically represent that he controls all the governments and nations of the earth. “Seven” is a symbol of things complete, of things that are invisible, while “ten” is a symbol of the completeness of things visible. Therefore the two together show that before the beginning of the fight and at the birth of The Government the Devil exercised complete power in heaven (invisible) and in earth over the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The birth of the “man child” symbolically represents The Government and marks the time when Christ’s government began its activity against Satan. The first act of that new government was to oust Satan from heaven. The war in heaven began, and Satan was thrown out into the earth. “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was east out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”—Rev. 12: 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font3">are enabled to interpret this prophecy as to time, because of what happened in the earth; and that being “the beginning of sorrows”, marked by the beginning of the World War in 1914, fixes the time; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">those sorrows must continue until the great battle of God Almighty against the Devil, which will result in the destruction of all his earthly power. (Rev. 16:13-16) The battle in heaven ended, the operations were transferred to the earth. “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabited of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.”—Rev. 12:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan at that time and since, seeing that his time is short for the preparation for the great battle of Armageddon, continues to influence the nations of the world to prepare for another great war while he, through Gog, his chief officer invisible, and his devoted sons the clergy, launches a wicked persecution against those who faithfully represent the Most High God on earth. This terrible persecution continues. This explains why the clergy and their organized system of religion throughout the earth today are opposed to the proclamation of the truth concerning God’s righteous government being established on earth. Jesus not only stated that (1914) the World War would be the beginning of sorrows, but further stated that the final end would be marked by the greatest tribulation ever known in the earth and that that would be the last. “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” (Matt. 24:21,22) These words of the Master explain the feverish and desperate effort being put forth by the rulers of the various governments of earth to prepare for trouble. Undoubtedly the rulers of these governments do not know that Satan is really instigating the preparation. The purpose of calling attention to it here is, not to hold up the rulers to shame and disgrace, but to point out the facts that the rulers, as well as the people, may know that Satan is the great enemy of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In that great battle in heaven the fight was led by Jesus and he was successful. The prophet shows that Jehovah, addressing his beloved Son at that time, said: “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchize-dek.” (Ps. 110:4) This proves that Christ Jesus is the antitype of Melehizedek and leads the fight against Satan the enemy as the great Field Marshal of Jehovah. Then the prophet represents Jehovah God on the right hand of his beloved Son, which means that Jehovah is his chief support: “My Lord on thy right hand hath shattered in the day of his anger kings; he will judge among the nations, full of dead bodies! He hath shattered the head over a land far extended. ’ ’ —Ps. 110: 5, 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In further corroboration upon this point God’s prophet speaks of Christ Jesus taking his authority to lead the forces of righteousness against the evil one and to victory: “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.”—Ps. 45:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God through his prophet Daniel gave an outline of the world powers, to wit, Babylon, when it became a world power, and those that followed, including the British Empire and the League of Nations. The League is a combination of more than fifty nations and is an organization of what is called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. The real author of the League of Nations is Satan the Devil. He is the master mind that brought about this confederacy of nations for the purpose of ruling the world. But that confederacy God declares shall completely fail and shall be broken to pieces. Read the words of God, if you will, in the prophecy of Isaiah, chapter eight, verses 9 to 12. It is approximately at that time that the prophecy written by Daniel begins its fulfilment. It is written: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.’’— Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, mark that it was in 1914 that the nations of earth began to assemble in war or tumult and the people began to imagine a foolish thing, to wit, that the World War would make the nations of earth safe for democracy; and further, that this could be brought about by a confederacy of nations. It was at that time that the prophecy was fulfilled by Jehovah’s placing upon the throne his beloved Son. Then the earthly rulers met together by appointment and the statesmen, financiers, and the clergy of the world agreed that they would not heed the fulfilment of prophecy, as set forth in God’s Word, but they would set up a rule on earth themselves and call it ‘the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’. This they did, calling it the League of Nations. They took counsel together against God and against his Anointed. The Lord holds them in derision and will exercise his power against them in due time. Mark how Jehovah through his prophet foretold exactly what has been taking place in this regard beginning in 1914: “Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult? Or should peoples mutter an empty thing? The kings of earth take their station, and grave men have met by appointment together, against Jehovah and against his Anointed One (saying): Let us break asunder their bonds, and cast from us their cords! He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh, My Lord will mock at them: then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his wrath confound them: yet I have installed my king, on Zion my holy mountain. ’ ’—Ps. 2:1-6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These scriptures establish beyond a doubt the fact that God is now proceeding to set in the earth his everlasting government of righteousness and that in setting it up no ambitious politician, conscienceless profiteer or clergyman will have anything to do with it. Christ is the invisible ruler of the government of righteousness and he will have his representatives on earth in God’s due time to conduct earth’s affairs aright. The setting up of his kingdom, which began in 1914, now progresses.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE KING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">NE of the most unusual characters mentioned in the Bible is Melchizedek, who is identified as the King of Salem, which means King of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Peace. He occupied a very high office, the meaning of which is only now clear to the careful student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Jehovah’s record that was provided by him many centuries ago, and which he has preserved to this day for the enlightenment of the people, there is an account of a remarkable occurrence in the life of the patriarch Abraham, who in the Bible is called the friend of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Abraham’s kinsman Lot was captured and carried away by enemies. Abraham went to his rescue and delivered Lot. On his return Melchizedek, the king of Salem, met Abraham and served him with bread and wine and caused Abraham to be comforted and blessed. In the record of Genesis fourteen, verses eighteen to twenty, it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On this occasion was made another great picture. Melchizedek there pictured the great executive officer of Jehovah God appointed to carry out God’s purposes, including the blessings that God had promised</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>OF PEACE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">to bestow upon mankind through the seed of Abraham. Melchizedek pictured the Logos, and Jesus, and Jesus Christ, the same mighty officer of Jehovah who bore all these titles. This is made clear from the Scriptures. It is written concerning Jesus: “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. ’ ’—Ps. 110:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a reason, of course, why Abraham came in contact with Melchizedek. Concerning this Paul writes: ‘ ‘ For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him ■ to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace. . . . Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: but he, whose descent is not counted from them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.”—Heb. 7:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the covenant God made with Abraham he said: “In blessing I will bless thee”; and again, “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” It follows then that Abraham himself must receive a blessing, and that which is related in the above scripture con-corning him and Melchizedek shows that it is the Priest whom Melchizedek foreshadowed that bestows the blessing upon all, including Abraham himself. This proves that Abraham personally is subordinate to the covenant and to God’s royal Priest of the order of Melehizcdek. This also makes it clear that in relation to the covenant Abraham is purely a figure representing God, who is the real source of all blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is observed that there is no mediator in the Abra-hamic covenant. Not all covenants must have a mediator. If the covenant is made in which only one binds himself, no mediator is required. If both parties to the covenant are competent to contract, a mediator is unnecessary. There are two good reasons why a mediator is not required in the Abrahamic covenant: (1) God obligated himself to bless all the families of the earth, and this he would do regardless of what anyone else might do. The covenant therefore was a one-sided or unilateral one and required no mediator. Therein Abraham is used as a figure representing Jehovah God. (2) Abraham had, at the time the covenant was made effective and binding, demonstrated his faith in God and therefore received God’s approval. His faith was counted unto him for righteousness or justification. Being counted righteous or justified he was competent to enter into a covenant with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A mediator is a go-between, intercessor, or reconciler. The entire human race must be .reconciled to God by and through Jesus Christ. There is no other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved and reconciled, as we read in .Acts four, verse twelve. Jesus himself said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) The apostle declares: “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” (1 Tim. 2:5.6) These scriptures do not have reference to a covenant, but undoubtedly refer to Jesus as the go-between or reconciler between God and men. The members of the church are not brought into Christ by the mediator of a covenant, but they come by virtue of faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. The people of earth who are restored will get their restitution blessings through the ministration of the promises of a new covenant, and the “seed” of the Abrahamic covenant will be the instrument to bring these blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In course of time Abraham died without having received the blessings that had been promised. Long thereafter Stephen, moved by the power of the holy spirit, testified concerning Abraham and said: “And he gave him none inheritance in [the land], no not so much as to set his foot on: yet he [God] promised that he would give it to him [Abraham] for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.” (Acts 7:5) Paul, after making mention of the faith of Abraham and others, under the direction of the Lord wrote: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” (Hob. 11:39,40) It is manifest from these words that in God’s due time Abraham shall be brought forth from the tomb and fully receive the blessings himself that were promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s prophet writes: “lie will ever be mindful of his covenant. . . . He hath commanded his covenant for ever.” (Ps. Ill: 5, 9) This is an assurance that Abraham shall return from the tomb when the time is due to receive his personal blessings according to the promise of the covenant God promised to bless him and he will ever be mindful of this his covenant. Abraham’s restoration is aho implied by the words written: “Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham.” (Exod. 3:6) Jesus placed an interpretation upon this statement of Jehovah when he said: “Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” (Luke 20: 37) Because the covenant guarantees a future life to the dead Abraham, is manifestly the reason why Jehovah called himself “the God of Abraham”. Also that Abraham was the type of the everlasting God suggests that Abraham shall live again and never die any more. “Thou wilt perform . . . the mercy to Abraham.” (Mic. 7:20) As a further guarantee, Jesus said: “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 8:11) The kingdom will be that of the Messiah, which constitutes the Priesthood of the Melchizedek order. Abraham will have a position in the kingdom of Messiah as a representative on the earth. This is shown by God's covenant promise to Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ is the instrument or royal Priest whom God will use during his thousand-year reign to bring all mankind who obey back into harmony with himself. Then wdl be fully accomplished the terms of the covenant because all the nations of earth will then have an opportunity to be reconciled to God. Those who obey God will be reconciled and fully restored. That will mark the complete fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant. The other covenants mentioned, namely, the law covenant, the covenant by sacrifice, and the new covenant, arc ancillary to the Abrahamic covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the wonderful work of carrying out the Abia-hamic promise to bless all the families of the earth the body members of Chiist, first participating in the blessing, are privileged to participate in the bestowing of the blessing upon others. The first ones selected as a part of the “seed” were Jews. Thereafterward the members of the body were selected from the Gentiles, or heathen. These are the ones God has specially taken out as a people for his name.—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the parables taught by Jesus bears upon this same matter. A parable is a symbolic or figurative statement that pictures some reality. Jesus spoke a parable concerning a certain rich man called Dives and a beggar named Lazarus. (Luke 16:19-31) “Dives,” meaning “rich man”, represented the Jewish people who had received the special favor of Jehovah God. Lazarus pictured the non-Jews who had received no favor, therefore were in the attitude of beggars. “And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. ’ ’—Luke 16: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The dying of Dives and Lazarus represents a complete change of their respective conditions. Abraham, being a representative of the Lord, pictured God; Abraham’s bosom figuratively represented the place of God’s favor. God through Christ cast the Jews away, thereby completely withdrawing from them. The Gentiles or non-Jews then in due time were brought into the favor of God, and during the Christian era these have had the privilege of becoming members of the “seed” according to the promise made to Abraham. Those who have thus been brought into God’s favor and who have proved faithful to their privileges of serving the Lord will in due time have a part in the work of reconciliation which God will do through Christ for the benefit of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At this particular time in the outworking of the divine purpose those who are thus favored, called and chosen of the Lord, have the great privilege of being God’s witnesses in the earth and thereby proving their loving devotion unto God. (1 John 4:17,18) Faithfulness unto the end will assure such of being made fully and completely a part of the “seed” of Abraham, according to the promise.</span></p>

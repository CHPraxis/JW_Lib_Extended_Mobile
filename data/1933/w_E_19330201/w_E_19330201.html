<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTABLE TRANSCRIPTION RECORD MACHINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a demand for a portable transcription machine for use to reproduce for the public the radio lectures made by the president of the Society. There are many such machines on the market which are cheap and wholly unsatisfactory and could not be depended upon. The Society has arranged for the building of a special machine that promises complete satisfaction. The cost of manufacturing this machine is slightly above that of the cheaper grades, but its value is far greater. The machine approved by the Society’s experts will be assembled at Cleveland, Ohio, by men fully equipped to make it, and will be shipped from there to any part of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One machine is electrically operated and can be used wherever there is 110-volt AC electrical current available. In most of the towns there is electric current. The cost of this machine delivered to companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, pioneers or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers will be $140. To meet a demand for reproducing these lectures in rural territory where there is no electrical current available a specially built machine operated by an extra strong spring is being made. This machine is guaranteed to give results and is dependable. The cost of this machine to pioneers and companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers, is $120, delivered to any part of the United States. Prices to foreign countries will be increased</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BROTHER RUTHERFORD’S MAIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Readers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will please note that Brother Rutherford is at Beth-Sarim, San Diego, during the winter. Mail sent to him for the next three or four months should be addressed as follows: J. F. Rutherford, 4440 Braeburn Road, Kensington Heights, San Diego, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ORDERING FOREIGN-LANGUAGE LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some brethren in the United States and other countries sometimes believe it advisable to ship literature direct from themselves to parties in other countries. This is a very unwise practice, for the reason that it causes much trouble in getting the literature into the other countries and in many cases it is confiscated. We earnestly request that all the brethren refrain from this practice. If you desire some individual in another country to have the literature in a certain language, please send your order with remittance to the Brooklyn office, or to a branch office, so that it can be properly filled. Large supplies of literature in different languages are kept in all countries where there is a branch, and it is better for the branch office to fill orders for people residing in that country.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SPIRITUALLY MINDED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Have, this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”—Phil. 2: 5, R.V.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the great Spirit, “the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity.” (2 Cor. 3: 17; Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">57: 15) He is invisible and ever will be invisible to human eyes. (1 Tim. 6: 16) To have an understanding and appreciation of the meaning of the term “spiritually minded” we must have a knowledge of Jehovah God, that great Spirit, and what is his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah is supreme, and his power is irresistible. For him to think of a thing to be done, and will that it be done, means that such thing shall be done. Jehovah puts his spirit upon his obedient creatures. That means the power of Jehovah moving his creatures in the way of righteousness. Such power or spirit is invisible to human eyes; yet the result of its operation is often visible to human eyes. The creature may be entirely without power to accomplish anything; but when Jehovah puts his spirit on that creature and wills that he shall accomplish something, the creature can accomplish that which God wills for him to accomplish. “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.” (Phil. 2: 13) “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.” (Eph. 3: 20) Therefore those who are in Christ can with the apostle say: “I can do all things through Christ which strength-eneth me.” (Phil. 4:13) It is the spirit of God working through Christ that makes the faithful followers of Christ strong and able to say: “Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.”—2 Cor. 12: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Christ Jesus is the express image of the Father Jehovah. At all times Christ Jesus has had his mind in harmony with Jehovah. All who are in Christ Jesus, and who continue to please Jehovah, must be in full accord with the mind of Jehovah. Hence it is of greatest importance to ascertain what is the mind of God and what is the mind of Christ Jesus. Understanding this the creature can begin to appreciate the meaning of the apostle’s words when he says: “Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Jehovah is righteous, and with him all things are right; that is to say, he always does that which is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">right. “The law of the Lord is perfect,... the statutes of the Lord are right,... the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous [always].” (Ps. 19: 7-9) “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth. He loveth righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.” (Ps. 33: 4, 5) The mind of Jehovah is disclosed by these words of the prophet: “For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.” (Ps. 11: 7) “The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.”— Ps. 34:15,16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Furthermore Jehovah’s mind is reflected in this, that he provides light for those who have a mind attuned to righteousness. “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (Ps. 97: 11) “Righteous art thou, 0 Lord, and upright are thy judgments. Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful. Thy word is true from the beginning; and every one of thv righteous judgments endureth for ever.”—Ps. 119: 137,138,160.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> It is from the Word of God that man learns what is the true mind of Jehovah. (John 17: 17) Men learn of God and of Christ Jesus through the Word, and this they must do in order to live. (John 17: 3) Those who love God, and who call upon him in truth and in sincerity, he hears because he loves righteousness and those who seek to know the way to do right. “The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous.” (Ps. 146: 8) “He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.” (Prov. 2:7) Jehovah makes known his purposes to those who have a mind like unto his. “His secret is with the righteous.” (Prov. 3: 32) “The thoughts of the righteous are right.” (Prov. 12: 5) Thoughts proceed from the mind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’ Jehovah is holy. ‘ ‘ But thou art holy, 0 thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.” (Ps. 22: 3) To his brethren Peter by the will of God wrote: “But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” (1 Pet. 1: 15,16) Jehovah God is wholly and completely devoted to righteousness. “The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Ps. 145:17,18) The creature that would be holy must devote himself entirely and completely to God and his righteous cause. In no other way could he become holy. All human creatures are imperfect; but when such creature, relying upon the blood of Christ Jesus as his redemptive price, is brought into the covenant with Jehovah and brought forth by the spirit of God, he is counted a new creature, even though in an imperfect organism. He can become holy then by entirely and completely devoting himself to Jehovah, and to do this he must have the mind of the Lord. Having such mind he exalts Jehovah and worships him in truth and in spirit. “Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy.”—Ps. 99: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WICKEDNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The very opposite of righteousness is wickedness. We must assume that Lucifer when he was anointed and placed in Jehovah’s organization was righteous and holy, otherwise Jehovah would not have placed him in that position of trust. He was perfect at the beginning, but after he was installed in office he became wicked. Concerning him it is written: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” -(Ezek. 28: 15) Lucifer set his mind against Jehovah and determined to do contrary to the will of Jehovah. He was enlightened and knew the way of right; but he chose to walk in the wrong way, and from that time he was and is wicked. He has led both men and angels in the way of unrighteousness; hence the mind of all such is to do that which is contrary to the will of God. Jehovah expresses his mind concerning those who love him, and also those who turn away from him and disobey him, when he says: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.” (Ps. 145: 20) The mind of one who is against God and the mind of the Lord is thus clearly distinguished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MIND OF CHRIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• There has never been a moment when the mind of Christ Jesus was out of tune with the mind of Jehovah. He is “the beginning of the creation of God” and has always been the delight of Jehovah because always with him. (Rev. 3: 14) He is the one that leads the creation of God in the way of righteousness. Concerning himself he said: “I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth; when he established the clouds above; when he strengthened the fountains of the deep; when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment; when he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.”—Prov. 8:20-30.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> By the exercise of his mind the beloved Son of God ascertained the will of Jehovah, and then with delight proceeded to act accordingly. “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8) The words of the prophet that immediately follow the above quotation show that the chief purpose of Christ Jesus at all times has been to make known to others the righteousness and glorious name of Jehovah: “I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, 0 Lord, thou knowest. I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.” (Ps. 40: 9,10) The name of Jehovah his Father, Christ Jesus has at all times exalted. Before he came to earth it is written of and concerning Jesus that he said: “I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.” (Ps. 22:22) When he had finished his work on the earth, and just before going to Calvary, Jesus said: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.”—John 17: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> It was Satan who challenged the word of Jehovah God, defamed his great and holy name, and put at issue the question of the supremacy of the Most High. For centuries Jehovah has permitted Satan to pursue his course of wickedness, and to the limit. In all that time of wickedness among creation Jesus Christ has boldly upheld and exalted the name of Jehovah. At all times he has maintained his integrity toward Jehovah. That action on his part makes manifest the mind of Christ. The Scriptures disclose that the greatest thing before the mind of Christ Jesus has ever been the vindication of his Father’s holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Seeing that the Lord Jesus from the beginning was ‘daily the delight of Jehovah’, we must conclude that there has been at all times a confidential relationship between God and his beloved Son; hence Jehovah would disclose to his Son each successive step of the outworking of his great purpose. The Son would early learn that the redemption of man from death, in which Satan had plunged the race, the setting up of the government of righteousness, and the bringing of man into harmony with God, in which men would then maintain their integrity toward God, would be a vindication of his Father’s name. Knowing this he joyfully undertook to carry out his Father’s will. He determined to do his Father’s will at any cost. Being in the form of God and daily associated with the Most High the Son did not even think of being on an equality with God. Therefore he “emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death ’ ’, even the most ignominious death. He died upon the tree, which, under God’s announced law, branded him in the eyes of all creation as a sinner. (Phil. 2: 6-8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.;</span><span class="font4"> Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13) The all-important thing with Christ Jesus was and is to do the will of his. Father, the doing of which he knows will vindicate his Father’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>xa</sup> When the man Jesus reached the age required to qualify a man for the priesthood he immediately began to do his Father’s will concerning the priestly office. The most severe temptation to which man was ever subjected was placed before him by the enemy, but he drove that tempter from his presence and declared his purpose to worship Jehovah God and to serve him only. (Matt. 4: 10) Immediately thereafter Jehovah anointed Jesus as King of the world, and from that time forward he has never missed an opportunity to declare the name of Jehovah and his kingdom that shall entirely vindicate his Father’s great name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> There has been a tendency on the part of all men to receive honor of other men. Almost all men when assigned to a position of trust delight to keep their own name before others, that they may receive honor of men. Such was not the mind of Christ Jesus. Mark his speech which proves beyond all doubt that he was never selfish. He told those about him that his Father had appointed him to judge the world, and had given him authority to execute judgment, and then added: “I can of mine own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.” (John 5: 30, 31) He magnified his Father’s Word by saying to his hearers: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.” (John 6:38,45) Thus he shows how his own mind was fixed and the only proper means by which a man can ascertain the will of God. Jesus had come to the earth to do honor to his Father’s name, and not to receive the approval of men. “I receive not honour from men. I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?” —John 5: 41,43,44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah had sent his beloved Son to proceed to do a specific work, and his mind was set on doing that work according to the will of his Father. To his disciples he said: “My meat is to do the will of [my Father] that sent me, and to finish his work.” (John 4: 34) He knew what Jehovah had done and was doing toward him and what he had sent Jesus to do. He had learned how his Father had exercised his own mind, and he was determined to do the same thing in the same manner. This is proved by the words recorded concerning him, to wit: “Many, 0 Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward; they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.” (Ps. 40:5) “How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!” (Ps. 139: 17) Such is the mind of Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FALSE CONCEPTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> As the Scriptures disclose, Satan is a wily and subtle foe. Many persons have entered into a covenant with God by and through faith in Christ Jesus and have then fallen under the blandishments of the Devil. Since the days of the apostles on earth the great majority of professed followers of Christ Jesus have thought that their chief work was and is to prepare themselves to be taken to heaven and there aid Jehovah in governing the universe. They have concluded that in order to do this they must shine amongst men. The vindication of Jehovah’s Word and name has not been in all their thoughts. Such have reasoned in this manner: “Now I am a new creature and a follower of Christ and I must deport myself before men as becomes a Christian. I must appear to be very sedate, and my speech must be soft, and my words well chosen, that I may show that ‘I have walked with Jesus and been with him’. I must be solemn in the presence of others and never give way to any hilarity or even enjoy a hearty laugh. On Sundays particularly I must be observed as having a Bible in my hand and must always let others understand how much I know about the contents of the Scriptures. This course I must take that those who see me will always say, That man is a real saint. If I pursue this course, then others will know and say, Surely he is spiritually minded.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> If there be a man in the organization of the church to whom the duty has been assigned, for instance, to manufacture books containing an explanation of the Scriptures, and that man consistently goes about the work and constantly sticks to it, seldom discusses scriptures or Scriptural questions with others, and declines at times to appear before a company of the Lord’s people to give a discourse on the Scriptures, then it has not been unusual for the “more holy than thou” to say of that man: “Well, surely he is not spiritually minded, because he does not act like the rest of us who are real Christians.” If, in addition to what is above related, this same man, who is used here as an illustration, sometimes would indulge in a harmless pastime amusement, such as listening to the announcement of the baseball score or occasionally attending a musical concert, and once in a while take a glass of wine, and would refuse to wear a long black garb, usually worn by clergymen, but instead wore bright colors, then the class known as “character developers” would say of that man: “Surely he is not spiritually minded.” Satan has induced many men to adopt just the false standard here mentioned and to conclude that they must develop what others would call “a sweet character” in order to have a spiritual mind. They have persuaded themselves to believe that such they must do in order to attract others to the truth and thus use their influence toward the Lord’s kingdom. Let it here be said that he who must be induced by imperfect man to serve Jehovah God will never serve the Most High in truth and in spirit and faithfully continue so to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What, then, is meant by the term “spiritually minded”, as the Scriptures use that term? (Rom. 8: 6) The proper definition of the term is: The mind of the creature that is diligent in ascertaining the will of God, that is set upon doing and maintaining an unbending determination to do the will of the great Spirit, and then doing it regardless of what any creature might think or say. The mind of the creature is that faculty with which God has endowed him for searching out the truth and reaching a conclusion thereupon, and which conclusion leads him to act. The will is the fixed determination of the man to act and which is reached by the exercise of his thoughts. Having his mind set on ascertaining God’s will, and having an unbending determination to do that will when ascertained, he never willingly deviates therefrom. Paul said to his brethren that the reasonable service of the follower of Christ Jesus is to devote himself wholly to God, and then adds: “And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom. 12: 2) This proves that a man cannot be conformed to this world if he would have the mind of Christ Jesus perfected in him. He must get away from the world by the renewing of his mind, which is accomplished by feeding the mind upon the Word of God. Thus he ascertains the will of God and then must do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Many have concluded that they must pursue a course of action among their fellows that would bring the approval of their fellow creatures and thus cause themselves to be honored by men. Having that mind they have sought the best positions in the church and have endeavored to exhibit their natural ability and their knowledge of the Scriptures, and this they have called ‘spirituality’. Many such have gotten themselves elected to the office of elder but have failed to become elders in fact according to the Scriptures. Convincing themselves that they are better than their weaker brethren they have declined to participate in what appeared to them to be the more ordinary service, such as going from house to house preaching the gospel by means of exhibiting that message in printed form. It is manifest that such creatures, regardless of their position amongst men, have not had the mind of Christ. To be spiritually minded or have the mind of Christ is not to seek or to receive honor from men, nor to think more highly of oneself than one ought to think. A man must think sanely, and he can be sane only when he thinks in harmony with God’s Word. —John 5: 41; Rom. 12: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STABILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> It has been said that every one begotten of the spirit is “spiritually minded”. But the Scriptures do not support that conclusion. Neither the “great multitude” class nor those who end in the “evil servant” class are spiritually minded. The Scriptures are specifically addressed to those brought into a covenant with God by faith in the blood of Christ Jesus. Writing to the spirit-begotten ones the apostle says: “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.” (Jas. 1: 8) What is a double-minded man, within the meaning of this text? Manifestly one who desires to please God and at the same time to please and receive the approval of man. No man can serve two masters, and no man can receive the approval of the world and at the same time have the approval of God. If he seeks the honor of men he is God’s enemy. (Jas. 4: 3, 4) Christ Jesus had nothing to do with the world and did not receive honor of men. (John 18: 36; 5: 41) To be spiritually minded means to have the mind of Christ; and that would mean to walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Those who are called to the kingdom are called to take exactly that course. (1 Pet. 2: 21) The apostle shows that an unstable mind leads one into the “evil servant” class, or “man of sin” class, because they think more highly of themselves than they ought to think and exalt themselves, which is an abomination in God’s sight. They are not established in every good work as every one must be who has the mind of Christ.—2 Thess. 2: 1-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Addressing the consecrated the apostle says: “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit.” (Rom. 8: 5) The visible creatures of Satan’s world are flesh, hence called “carnal”. If one who is in a covenant with God to walk in the footsteps of Jesus has his mind divided between the things of Satan’s organization and the things of Jehovah’s organization, he is unstable; and unless he takes his stand wholly on the side of Jehovah, and sets his mind and affections on the things of God’s kingdom, he cannot live, but must die. This the apostle makes clear when he says: “For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.” —Rom. 8: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The refraining from the beastly practices in which fallen men indulge, and pursuing what the world calls a clean life, and using soft speech and talking about the Scriptures, are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the Scriptures concerning the spiritually minded. Many decent men do that much and yet are seeking wholly the approval of the world. One who is pleasing to God must do much more than merely lead what is called “a clean life”. Christ Jesus devoted himself wholly and entirely to Jehovah, took his instructions from God, and still does only the will of Jehovah. He was perfect, pure and clean in his organism, and in every other way. It is not his perfection in organism, but his full and complete devotion to Jehovah, that received Jehovah’s approval. He was not beset by temptations such as depraved men have. The great temptation before him was whether or not he would yield in the slightest to the will of Satan. Never for one instant did he hesitate, but he pushed Satan aside and declared his purpose to do God’s will. Those who are now in Christ Jesus must do likewise, in order to be spiritually minded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The mind of humankind is set upon doing the things of this world, which means to support the religious systems and to be a part of the political and commercial element that rule and control the world, all of which are under Satan and all of which are against God. Such worldly creatures laud and praise men and exalt men and tell of the great achievements of men, but they do not honor the name of Jehovah. If a man who has made a covenant to do God’s will fails or refuses to obey the commandments of Jehovah in order that he may thus save himself from the criticism or persecution of the world, then he is a follower after the flesh and is carnally minded and against God and his kingdom. “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”—Rom. 8: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> If the new creature in Christ has his mind set upon God and his kingdom and his heart devotion is wholly to God, even though his organism is flesh and he is very imperfect yet in the sight of God he is not in the flesh. This the apostle makes clear when he says: “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” (Rom. 8:9) Such is the requirement of one who will be pleasing to God, and no others receive the anointing of Jehovah. He who has the spirit of Christ has the mind of Christ, and is therefore spiritually minded. He is devoted to God’s kingdom and is not at all lifted up or disturbed by the things of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Discussing the warfare to which the followers of Chrisr are subjected the apostle says: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Eph. 6: 12) This shows that Satan the invisible one and his wicked host are warring against the new creatures in Christ Jesus, the same as they did against Christ himself; and that the follower of Christ, in order to be spiritually minded, must be against Satan and his organization and wholly and completely for Jehovah God and his organization. There can be no compromise. There is nothing in common between the two. There is a deadly conflict between the two. To have the mind of Christ, then, means to be against the world, which is the Devil’s organization. The words of James are easily understood in the light of this truth, that to be a friend of the world is to be God’s enemy, and to seek the approval of men makes one the enemy of God.—Luke 16: 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SAFETY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> One who has the mind of Christ, and who is therefore spiritually minded, can appreciate what is meant by the words of the text: “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” (Prov. 18: 10) With Jesus the great and important part of his work was and is the vindication of the name of Jehovah, which Satan has defamed. With those who have the mind of Christ the great and important work of theirs is to have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah has made this matter clearly to appear in these latter days because the time has arrived to vindicate his name. Up until now he has permitted Satan to remain and to continue to pursue his course of wickedness, and the climax is now reached. Now he has enthroned his beloved Son as King and sent him forth to rule. Jehovah’s judgment is that Satan and his organization must be destroyed, which work Christ Jesus will shortly do. All those who are in Christ and hence have the mind of Christ now rejoice that God has made it possible for them to have some part in the execution of his judgments. Their part, of course, is to announce the judgments of the Lord. The kingdom has been born and has begun, hence we are now in the morning and in the freshness of youth of that kingdom. Therefore it is written concerning those who have the mind of Christ: “Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power, in holy array.” (Ps. 110: 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Such have but one thing in mind, and that is to do the will of Jehovah. Having their mind set upon ascertaining his will they have searched the Scriptures and have learned therefrom what is the will of God concerning them; and now they are determined to do his holy will, and they will not be turned away from doing it by anything of the world or by anything else.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The wicked men are those who have once known God and who have then refused to do his will by associating themselves with the world, and hence are carnally minded. Jehovah’s judgment is that all the wicked shall be destroyed. (Ps. 145: 20) In harmony therewith the apostle says: &quot;To be carnally minded is death.” Those who have the mind of Christ are safe because they see that the name of Jehovah is now to be vindicated and that his name is above all and of supreme importance. They take their stand on the side of Jehovah and joyfully in obedience to his expressed will become his witnesses and delight to proclaim his name. Therefore to them the name of Jehovah is a strong tower or fortress, and because they are in Christ they are righteous and they take their place in this tower and are safe.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIGHER POWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The &quot;higher powers” are those of Jehovah’s organization to whom Jehovah has delegated authority to do work in his name. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the &quot;higher powers”, while Jehovah himself is the supreme power. In the invisible part of Jehovah’s organization are the faithful saints who have been raised to glory with Christ Jesus; while on the earth there is a visible part of his organization made up of those who are wholly devoted to God and to his kingdom. These latter ones are called &quot;the remnant” and must have the mind of Christ if they will receive God’s final approval. With such all instruction from God’s organization must be carried out, not to please men, but to honor and please God. These faithful ones constitute the &quot;faithful and wise servant” class now on the earth to whom the Lord has committed certain interests of his kingdom. The servant keeps his mind set upon knowing and doing the will of God; hence it is written concerning him: &quot;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.” (Isa. 26: 3) All m Christ have now come to the unity of the spirit, and all such are of one mind. The church is at the time concerning which the apostle wrote: &quot;Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.” (Phil. 2: 2,3) Each one, therefore, who has the mind of Christ is seeking to do with his might what is committed to him to do. If his work be to produce &quot;better and more books” that the name of Jehovah might be made known, and he diligently and faithfully pursues that work, then it is truly said of that man that he has the mind of Christ and is therefore spiritually minded. He is obedient to the &quot;higher powers”. That which is pleasing to God is faithfulness in the performance of assigned duty. It is to such that the words of the Lord Jesus are addressed: &quot;Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” (Rev. 2: 10) The remnant are specifically commanded now to be obedient to the &quot;higher powers”, to wit, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, which includes the orders that are sent to them through Jehovah God’s organization. They are to do this regardless of what the world may say; and doing it faithfully unto God is evidence of spiritual mindedness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGLENESS OF DEVOTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The mind of Christ is expressed by the words of Jehovah’s prophet who said: &quot;Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant?” (Isa. 42: 19) It is God’s ‘elect servant’ that is here mentioned, and that servant is blind to everything of the world, has nothing whatsoever to do with it, but is against it; and that servant is wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, hence is of singleness of devotion. The same thought was expressed by the apostle when he said: &quot;This one thing I do.” Those who are of the remnant class now have their affections set upon Jehovah and his kingdom, and upon nothing else. Their devotion is entirely thereto. Being of the servant, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, these have the mind of Christ Jesus. These do not engage in service as &quot;men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God”. They delight to follow the admonition of the apostle, to wit: &quot;And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ.” (Col. 3:23,24) Each one of the remnant will now have these scriptures in mind and will be diligent to do what the Lord has put in his hand to do. Some have been delegated to prepare the message in readable form, others to carry that message of the kingdom to the people that the name of Jehovah may be known. All are in unity because all doing one thing, and that thing the making known and exalting the name of Jehovah. All in Christ now must be at unity. Because of their imperfections in their organism they may not be able to please each other, but their hearts’ devotion must be to the Lord and his kingdom and wholly bent upon pleasing him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The spiritually minded will not indulge in hypocrisy by pretending to be what they are not and could not be. Like the kingdom to which they are called, these must be four-square at all times, sincerely representing Jehovah and his kingdom. They will be wholly deaf to the flatteries of men and to the harsh criticisms of men. They will refuse to make common cause with anything of this world. They know that Jehovah is always right and his ways are holy and righteous. They know that Christ Jesus is the express image of Jehovah and entirely and wholly devoted to righteousness. They know that in order for them to be holy they too must be entirely and completely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, which is righteous and true. Each one of the remnant now knows the will of God, because it is made clear. Each one will now have his mind set upon doing it, and with an unbending determination to do God’s will he will proceed in the right way. With the mind and heart devotion like Christ Jesus’ the remnant now press forward in the battle, looking to that happy day when they may be associated with their faithful brethren in the kingdom, who have been faithful in their devotion to God, and who have kept his commandments, and who are now for ever with Christ Jesus. Continuing in this way to the end, the faithful remnant in due time will be for ever in Jehovah's service, and together with Christ Jesus will for ever be exalting the name of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ONENESS OF FATHER AND SON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font4">HEN Jesus said, “I and my Father are one,” did he refer to the “trinity” that is taught in the “Apostles’ Creed”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What did Jesus mean when he prayed, just before his crucifixion, that his disciples might be made perfect in one, even as the Father and he were one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus neared the time of the end of his earthly ministry he said to his disciples: “If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.” (John 14: 15-17) In these words he clearly set forth the distinction between himself, his Father, and the holy spirit. He plainly said that he would pray to his Father that his Father would send the comforter and that the comforter is the holy spirit, and that the holy spirit would dwell in his disciples because they were his and because God had chosen them to be his. He then pointed out to them that there were yet things that they cculd not fully understand but that they were yet to be baptized with the holy spirit and that then they would understand. He said: ‘ When the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth. ’ (John 16:13) The holy spirit was given to the disciples at Pentecost, as the Scriptures plainly set forth, and then the disciples spoke as the holy spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:4) That is the time that the disciples received the anointing of the Lord God through the Head, Christ Jesus, and were clothed with power and authority to speak, and thereafter they spoke the truth with boldness and without fear.—Acts 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time came for Jesus to finish his work, which the Father had put into his hands. Jesus knew that he was shortly to be crucified. He knew that he should stand before men as the enemy of his Father; that is to say, that men would regard him as a sinner and that he would die as a sinner. This was a great trial of suffering to him. He prayed unto God his Father in heaven: “Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. ’ ’ He had manifested his Father’s name unto men. He was not seeking exaltation, but his great desire was to be restored to the sweet fellowship and communion he had had with his Father. Therefore he prayed: “And now, 0 Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. ’ ’—John 17:1, 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Jesus was then God, as the clergy insist, why should he be praying to himself such a prayer? Either he did pray to himself or else he was practicing a fraud. Whichever horn of the dilemma the preachers take they find themselves without support in the Word of God. Had Jesus been equal to his Father in power and in eternity there would have been no occasion for him to pray on this or any other occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to that time Jesus had said to his disciples: “I and my Father are one. . . . Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.” (John 10: 30; 14:10,11) These texts have been seized upon by the trinity preachers to prove that God and Jesus are one. Jesus himself makes clear what is meant by the oneness of himself and the Father. In his prayer uttered on the last night he was on earth before his crucifixion, among other things he said to his Father: “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one. ’ ’ (John 17: 20-22) Here Jesus was praying for those who would believe on him and who should be anointed as members of his body, which is the church. God gave him to be the head over the church, that he and the church might be one. This was what he taught the disciples, and this is what afterward the disciples taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul wrote: “As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12) Paul gave an illustration of this, using the husband and the wife for that purpose. “But I would have you know, that . . . the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.” (1 Cor. 11:3) “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.” (Eph. 5: 23) With this illumination of the matter by the apostle we can see clearly what Jesus meant. As the man is the head of his wife, even so Christ is the head of the church. As the man and wife are regarded as one, even so Christ and his church are regarded as one. As Christ is over the church, even so God is over Christ; therefore they are all one in organization. The wife recognizes her husband as head, the church recognizes Jesus as the head, and Jesus recognizes God as the head. This is the thought the apostle further expresses when he says: “Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.” (Eph. 1: 21-23) Thus is proven the complete uniting of God, Christ, and the church. By one invisible power are they united and therefore are said to be one in spirit. There is complete harmony between God the Father and Christ Jesus the Son of God and the church, the members of his body. This is another absolute contradiction of the trinity and incarnation dogmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus was in Gethsemane, and knowing that he was facing an ignominious death, he offered prayers and supplications unto God his Father. He was not praying to himself at that time. If the trinitarians are correct he was praying to himself and committing a fraud. If they are wrong and the Scripture is right, he was praying to God in sincerity and in truth. It is much better to trust the Lord God than to trust men. God tells the truth, and his Word is true. (Ps. 118: 8, 9) Paul testifies that he prayed to his Father and that he was heard. “Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. ’ ’—Heb. 5:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the mob came to arrest Jesus one of his disciples, in attempting the defense of his Master, smote off the ear of the high priest’s servant. “Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matt. 26: 52, 53) If Jesus was then God himself incarnate, as the clergy have told the people, and if he was equal with God in power and eternity, why should he give utterance to these words? Why would he say that he could pray to his Father for help? Why not exercise that power himself? Jesus always told the truth, and if he had been God he would not have there stated that he could pray to his Father and get immediate aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why have the clergy ignored all these statements of Jesus and the apostles ? Why have they seized upon a dogma or doctrine which they themselves cannot explain and which no one can understand, and why do they insist on teaching a doctrine that dishonors God and destroys the value of the great ransom sacrifice? There is but one answer: They are willingly or unwillingly the instruments in the hands of the god of this world, Satan the Devil, who has used them to blind the minds of the people, to prevent the people from understanding God’s great purpose of salvation and reconciliation.—2 Cor. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great array of Scriptural testimony proves beyond a doubt that the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation; that it was the will of God that man should be ransomed from death and the grave; that God’s love prompted him to make this provision for man’s reconciliation; that there could be no reconciliation except this be done in perfect accord with justice; that justice could be met only by the sacrifice of a perfect human life; that if Adam and his race were to be released another perfect man must take Adam’s place as a substitute in death; that in the earth there was no perfect man; that God transferred the life of the Logos from the spirit to the human plane and made him a man and nothing more than a man; that Jesus was born of a woman but not begotten of a man, but was begotten by the power of God, the holy spirit; that he was therefore perfect, holy, harmless and separate from sinners, and that God made him thus in order that he might become the Ransomer and Redeemer of mankind, to the end that the people might have life.—Matt. 20: 28; John 10:10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE THREE PATRIARCHS, MEN OF FAITH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE beginning of God’s typical organization on earth was Abraham, who at first was called Abram. He was the grandfather of Jacob, afterwards called Israel. He is known as the father of the faithful. (Gal. 3:9) He was counted a righteous man and “the Friend of God”. (Jas. 2:23; Isa. 41:8) As a man he was imperfect, of course, being one of the descendants of Adam; but his heart was right and he believed on and served God. and therefore his faith was counted for righteousness. As it is written in Genesis, chapter fifteen, verse six: “And he believed in the Lord; and he [the Lord] counted it to him [Abraham] for righteousness.”—Rom. 4: 9, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abram resided with his father Terah in Ur of the Chaldees. Only two generations had passed since Adam’s death, and by tradition from his fathers Abram would learn of Adam’s wrongful course. He would learn about Abel, and also how God rewarded the faith of Enoch. He would learn, too, that it was the faith of Noah that caused God to save him from the flood and to use him to begin again to people the earth. The twelfth chapter of Genesis shows that the young man Abram chose the way of faith and trust in the Lord God. In obedience to God’s command Abram left the land of his nativity and journeyed to the strange land then occupied by the Canaanites and hence known as the land of Canaan. (Gen. 12: 7) Then Abram journeyed on to the south part of the country. There was a famine in that land, and Abram went on down into Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To Abram God had made the promise that he should have a seed or offspring, and that through him and his seed the blessings of all the families of the earth should come. The Devil hated that seed, in harmony with God’s words to the serpent in Eden: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Gen. 3:15) Doubtless “that old Serpent, which is the Devil”, knew of the promise made to Abram. Therefore he began to devise a scheme to have the wife of Abram debauched by Pharaoh, one of Satan’s own servants, and thus compel God either to accept this unholy offspring as the seed or else to repudiate his own word. Satan so arranged it that the princes of Pharaoh would see the beautiful wife of Abram, and then go to Pharaoh and commend her to the king who, to gratify his lust, would be an easy tool to carry out the Devil’s scheme. (Gen. 12:15-17) Accordingly Pharaoh had Sarah, the beautiful wife of Abram, brought into his palace, intending to gratify himself. But the Lord God protected Abram and Sarah by bringing great plagues upon the house of Pharaoh; and the king, becoming alarmed, sent Sarah away undefiled. Thus failed another wicked scheme of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abram then returned to the land of Canaan, and God again made promise to him that he should have that land for himself and for his seed after him. (Gen. 13:15) When Abram was ninety-nine years old God appeared unto him and said: “I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be thou perfect. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”—Gen. 17:1, 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ever on the alert to thwart the purposes of the Lord, again Satan made an attempt to have Sarah, the wife of Abraham, debauched that the promised seed might be defiled. This time Satan’s attempt was through King Abimelech, the ruler of the Philistines. Again God thwarted the wicked one’s purpose.—Gen. 20: 1-7; 21:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Sarah had passed the time according to women, and Abraham was one hundred years old, God overruled these seemingly unfavorable conditions and caused Sarah to conceive and bear a son; and he was named Isaac. The Lord made the promise then to Abraham: “In Isaac shall thy seed be called.’’ (Gen. 21:1,12) That Isaac foreshadowed ‘the seed of promise’ through whom the blessings must come to mankind is clearly stated by the divine record.—Gal. 3: 8,16; 4:22-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point God made a living picture which foreshadowed the unfolding of a part of his purpose. In this picture Abraham was used to represent God, while Isaac was used to represent the only begotten and beloved Son of God, who was afterwards called by the name Jesus. Abraham’s offering of Isaac upon the altar foreshadowed that the Son of God would be offered as a great sacrifice to provide a sin-offering for the benefit of the world, to the end that in God’s due time the peoples of the earth might be delivered from the enemy, from his wicked influence and from his wrongful acts which had brought death upon the human race. Abraham did not understand what the picture meant. With him it was purely a matter of faith. God commanded him what to do, and that he did. It was a test of Abraham’s faith, but he bravely met the test and God rewarded his faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In making this picture the Lord God directed Abraham to take Isaac, his only son, whom he loved dearly and in whom he had all his hopes centered, and to go to Mount Moriah and there offer up his son as a burnt offering. Because God had told Abraham that “in Isaac shall thy seed be called’’ and that the blessings shall come through him, this was a crucial test to offer up as a sacrifice this only son. In obedience to the Lord’s command Abraham provided wood for the altar, fire, and a knife; and with this provision he and his son journeyed to Mount Moriah. Abraham built the altar, laid the wood in order, bound his son Isaac and laid him upon the altar upon the wood, and then stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. In another instant the knife would fall and his son would be dead. God’s purpose here was to test and prove Abraham’s faith. Abraham having met the test, the Lord God arrested the hand that would have slain the son. The record in Genesis, chapter twenty-two, verses eleven to eighteen, reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And Abra&lt;-ham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies : and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.” The prophetic shadow made by this picture was afterwards carried out in every particular. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”—John 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Afterward Rebecca became the wife of Isaac, and Rebecca was barren. Then Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, and Rebecca conceived. Twin sons were born and were named Esau and Jacob. God made it clear that Jacob should succeed to the promise, and that through him should the seed for the blessing of mankind come. Satan, alert to acts of wickedness and following his usual course, devised a scheme to have Esau kill his brother Jacob. (Gen. 27:42,43) Jacob fled into the land of Haran. On the way he slept on a hill, afterwards called Bethel. For a pillow he used a stone, for a mattress the bare ground, and for a covering the canopy of heaven above. While he slept the Lord appeared unto him in a dream and said to him: “I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.”—Gen. 28:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was this same Jacob whose son Joseph was sold into Egypt and later became the ruler of that land, and gave a witness in the name of the Lord God. It was this same Jacob who was the father of the great multitude of Israelites whom God miraculously delivered from Egypt. From that day to this God caused a chain of events to picture and foreshadow the gradual unfolding of his great purpose, pointing to the Savior of the world who shall deliver from the enemy and from his wicked influence every one of the human race who will show faithfulness unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jacob had twelve sons, and they became the heads of the twelve tribes or divisions of the nation of Israel. Jacob grew old, and the time came for him to die. He called before him his sons and, his mind being moved upon by the invisible power of God, he uttered this great prophecy: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. ” (Gen. 49:10) “ Sceptre ’ ’ means the right to rule. “Lawgiver” means one who shall guide the people in the way that they shall go, who shall shield and protect them and teach them the way to life. “Shiloh” means the Messiah, or great Deliverer. “Unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” Thus the Lord God caused a prophecy to be uttered by Jacob, foretelling the coming of him who would undo the wicked work of the Devil and who would do also that which the unfaithful Lucifer should have done when he was perfect, before iniquity was found in him and he became Satan the Devil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GRATITUDE TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For a long time we have felt constrained to write and tell you of our heartfelt gratitude to Jehovah for the wonderful way in which you are being used to dispense to the remnant at this time the marvelous unfolding of prophecy. Words fail to express our great delight and joy on reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Books One, Two and Three, and even more so in having the privilege of passing same on to the people, who are in real need of this message, not knowing for what they crave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the words of the Apostle Paul, “We give thanks to God always for you . . . , making mention of you in our prayers; remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With much Christian love,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COMFORT, STRENGTH, COURAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> came in yesterday while we were out in the service, and we wish to thank you for it, and not only for this book, but for others sent me. I have many, many times wished to write you, expressing my appreciation for the many good things that the Lord has permitted you to make clear to us. I know you are very busy, and no doubt often weary; so have refrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The remnant is now feasting on this further manifestation of His love and tender care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> One and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> Two. came out I was too happy for words. After reading a few chapters in Book One I put it down and commenced walking the floor. One of my sons said: “Mother, what is the matter with you?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To which I replied: “I am so happy. Just think, the Lord let me have a little part in pouring out those seven vials, and I am just learning what it means. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the articles on Mordecai and Esther came out I experienced a wonderful calm; said to others, “Oh, how I wish that would come to us in book form; it is a gem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It gave me comfort, strength and courage to know if we continue faithful we will have protection, no matter what trials await us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two days this week I was not physically able to get out; so gathered all four articles on “Ruth” to read. Had a great time; no one around to interrupt; thoroughly enjoyed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I came in yesterday and found </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> immediately I turned to the first paragraph on page 276 and finished the subject on “Ruth”, and am now ready to begin at first of book, and anticipate great pleasure and profit in rereading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I call attention, many times each day, to the goodness of Jehovah in giving us an understanding of Ezekiel at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Twas a surprise, and like an answer to a prayer, when “Esther” and “Ruth” came in under one cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the dear Father continue to use you in </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">makin</span><span class="font3">g known to his children the steps before us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please accept my thanks for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Books One, Two and Three, and for the precious </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> book. It is most wonderful How it encourages us to faithfulness and makes us more determined to press on in this most wonderful work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a privilege to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses at this time! There are many things we could tell you, but, knowing how valuable your time is, will not take any more of it than just enough to tell you how much we enjoy the blessed truths that are coming from Jehovah by your pen, and knowing Jehovah is able to keep all who are obedient to him makes us able to press the battle to the gates more each day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THANKFUL FOR PART IN KING’S WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in the name of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I can no longer resist the temptation to write you a few words in a feeble attempt to express my sincere Christian love and admiration for you as a faithful witness and worker for our heavenly Father and his dear Son our </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">g. How your dear heart must throb in its intense desire to see the word and name of our heavenly Father vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The consecrated and faithful spirit manifested by you in performing the work assigned you by our heavenly Father should be, and is, a great inspiration to the faithful remnant in these troublous times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am thankful beyond expression for the great privilege of having even a small part in the King’s work, and of feasting at his table on food that he causes his faithful, tried and true servant to prepare so splendidly for the encouragement, maintenance and preservation of the earthly part of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> One proved to be an appetizer to prepare the way for Two and Three, which settle for all the question of their standing in Jehovah’s organization. Each of the remnant may now know exactly what his standing is, and where. It is as though a flood-light were turned into a room lighted by a candle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now comes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> which should for ever dispel any doubts or fears or feelings of uncertainty that might in unguarded moments creep into the minds of Jehovah’s witnesses, who by reason of human frailties may be subjected to perplexities by Satan and his “henchmen”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the grace of the heavenly Father, I shall go militantly forward, constantly endeavoring to sing forth his praise with fever increasing volume m a manner pleasing to him, fearing nothing except that of displeasing Jehovah by a lack of zeal. I assure you, dear Brother Rutherford, I am with you to the limit of my ability; if I die, I die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the peace of Jehovah constantly enshroud you, giving you that sense of security which Satan and all his agents cannot pierce, is the humble supplication of your fellow servant and witness,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE WAR!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I received </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> a week or more ago, but every minute has been so fully occupied that I have not to date sent acknowledgment. I can use a Portable on the train and must send a word of gratitude for the blessing of the Lord through your faithful service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This morning’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> lesson recalled page 150 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> and its clear statement that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It may therefore be expected that every part of Satan’s wicked organization will continue to march on to Armageddon with the full determination to completely destroy God’s remnant and to stop all witness work to Jehovah’s name upon the earth. There is no alternative left for the remnant. They must take the course which God has pointed out for them, knowing that their continuous unselfish devotion to the Most High will insure his preservation and deliverance of them. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This states the keynote of the present-hour work and the substance of the instruction that so stirred the friends at Houston and San Antonio and which leaves such a stimulus to activity and zeal for the service visits that I have been privileged to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Coaching the workers now that the instruction that the assemblies so effectively prompted means a score of details that must have been measurably overlooked before. The attitude of mind that these assemblies leave with the friends is remarkably favorable for effective results, and these results are in evidence as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even in the conservative south a zest and stimulus is awakened that is sure to be in evidence in results, and it never was such a joy to have a share in the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The months of September, October and November have overflowed with blessing as had no previous time in the service work, and I am grateful to the Lord for the privileges and opportunities he has accorded to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The friends catch the thought that they must </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prepare for war</span><span class="font3"> and grasp the import of Joel 3:9,12, the meaning of which we quite overlooked before </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> informed us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a work of joy to see the “mighty men” respond and really </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wake up,</span><span class="font3"> and they are surely doing it here in southern Texas as they probably are doing everywhere under the stimulus of the call of Jehovah’s Gideon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grateful to our great Chief Commander for the battle-call, and thankful that it is ours to hear the “shout”, I am more than anxious to be in the battle until the victory is proclaimed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s grace and peace, which passeth all understanding, be unto you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the name of Jehovah I greet you. I am very poor to express in any way my appreciation, and to tell you that I am thankful to the great Jehovah God, also to thank you and the Society, for the various and many gifts which Jehovah has served his people through his organization at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Truly it is Jehovah’s power that has enabled me to see the great blessings which he has for his people in the future. During the visit by Brother Koerber, from the 9th to the 11th of December, at Day ton, Ohio, Jehovah had proof for anyone who loves him as to the necessity of unity for the purpose of the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Truly this is the very time when we have the opportunity from Jehovah God to express our love to him by proclaiming to the people that the only hope for mankind is the kingdom of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dear brother, I ask you to remember me in your prayers, and I will remember all before the throne of grace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">These words of heartfelt appreciation unto the Most High are called forth as a result of feeding upon the gracious things found in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span><span class="font3"> Surely it’s the Lord’s doing, and “it is marvelous in our eyes’’; for I find it ‘<sup>1</sup> food convenient” upon the table of the Lord our God m this day of battle, and it brings joy and strength and comfort in a time of need that we may go forth as Jehovah’s witnesses to declare his name and purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This book furnishes the evidence, not only that the battle of the great day is near, but also that the Lord has provided this very need to enable us to be bold and courageous in pressing the battle to the very gates of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Easton company, who now stand as a unit m the army of the Lord, feed upon many precious truths and promises found in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> as they prepare to go forth in the * ‘ besiege” of the cities. And it awakens in the heart this song: “The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. ’ ’—Ps. 118: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And while I give thanks unto God, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Giver</span><span class="font3"> of all these blessings through Christ the Lord, still I desire, also, to extend my gratitude to you, Brother Rutheiford, tor your work and labor of love, and your example to the remnant m loyalty, obedience and loving devotion to our great Jehovah God, m thus bringing forth the fruit of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, Jehovah’s name be praised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lovingly, your fellow soldier in the King’s army,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hiram</span><span class="font3"> P. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kleinhans, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THRILLED TO GREATER ACTIVITY AND ZEAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Kentucky quartette of Jehovah’s witnesses, with happy hearts, are singing, ‘ ‘ Gre't is our God and greatly to be praised.” Never was there such great cause to praise his holy name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindications</span><span class="font3"> thrilled the heart of the remnant to greater activity and zeal in obeying the commands of the Lord; and while we were still ‘ ‘ chewing our cud ’ ’ from these, the thirteen booklets and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> appeared. Truly the “windows of heaven ’ ’ are opened, and the showers of blessing have become regular cloud-bursts this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our hearts rejoice in thankfulness and praise in the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> God’s gift of encouragement to the church, in which Jehovah in his divine wisdom hid his precious promise to preserve his faithful remnant and now discloses his secret just preceding the crucial hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We rejoice, also, in the mobilizing of the troops for more concerted action against the Devil’s crowd, and could shout for joy as the reports come to us of the boldness of the Lord’s army in attacking the enemy in aggressive warfare.—Acts 4: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We wish to express our deep appreciation of your loyal devotion to Jehovah and your boldness in declaring the Truth that will exalt and glorify Jehovah’s name before all his enemies, and which comforts and encourages his anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are with you heart and soul in this great work of bearing the Kingdom fruits to the people, and rejoice to be used in full-time service in the vindication of his glorious name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We remember you continually before the throne of grace that the Lord’s blessing may be yours and that he may continue to use you to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in the joyful service of our King,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Praise to Jehovah tor using you in the giving of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font3"> such a precious gift, just at the right time. It surely thrilled me and filled me with increased faith in the God whom we serve. The kingdom witness work is indeed a privilege, the greatest privilege ever granted any creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My many thanks and Christian love to the Bethel family in sharing their mite with those who labor with them in love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Because of the large output of money for the manufacture of these machines in quantity, and which money must be advanced by the Society, we ask that the money accompany the order for each machine. The price barely covers the cost of production and delivery. There will be no financial profit to the Society or anyone handling the machine. In addition thereto the Society supplies the transcription records in the way of a loan and each one used will be passed on to someone else. These transcription records will be supplied to those purchasing machines for public proclamation of the kingdom message. The machines may be used in halls, schoolhouses or homes. It will be an accommodation if you send your order immediately, that we may know just how many machines to order manufactured. If you are unable to send the money now with your order please state how soon the purchase price will be remitted. By having this information in advance, if the number of orders received is sufficient the cost price may be slightly reduced, and whatever reduction there is the purchaser will receive the benefit therefrom. The only purpose of producing these machines is to give a wider witness to the kingdom message. Address all correspondence to Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Latin America—The Question Mark of the 20th Century</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>In Three Parts—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">F ONE takes the map of South America, mounts it on a board, and cuts out the great country of Brazil, what he has left is a huge question mark. It is in the order indicated by that question mark that we hope to give some consideration to this interesting portion of our planet. And we shall find questions a plenty, some of which we shall find it hard to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bulk of Africa lies above the equator, but the bulk of South America lies below the equator. Until the Panama Canal was opened South America was in a corner by itself. Being in the opposite hemisphere from the principal land masses of the world, it has tended to develop along lines peculiar to itself. Other factors have favored that tendency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The northernmost part of South America is altogether south of the latitude of the Sahara Desert. The mouths of the Amazon and the Congo are in nearly the same latitude. Sydney, in Australia, Auckland, in New Zealand, and Cape Town, in South Africa, are in the same latitude as Buenos Aires. South America extends 1,500 miles nearer the south pole than does Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The west coast of South America, most of it, is straight south of New York city. Brazil extends east of that line twenty-six hundred miles. South America, most of it, is in the tropics. People in the tropics must live and do live at a different pace than is usual in the temperate zones. The bulk of Mexico, with all that intervenes down to Argentina, is subject to the range of direct solar rays, i.e., tropical weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Altitude has an important bearing upon life in South America. Each ascent of 330 feet causes a variation of one degree Fahrenheit in temperature. There are places on the equator that are uncomfortably chilly. Thus in the tropics altitude tends to offset latitude. A point at 5,000 feet altitude on the equator has the same climate as one fifteen hundred miles north or south, at sea level. Mexico city is in the torrid zone, but as it is at an elevation of 7,500 feet the climate is that of eternal spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Andes and the Amazon</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Andes mountain system is much more rugged than anything found in North America. Between Tolima, a Colombian peak eighteen thousand feet high, and Aconcagua, in Argentina, twenty-three thousand feet high, there are several peaks in Ecuador and Bolivia which are well over twenty thousand feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Throughout the Andes system there are active volcanoes, many of which are constantly in a steaming condition, with frequent eruptions. Earthquakes are frequent. For more than three thousand miles the Andes offer very few passes as low as twelve thousand feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In very many places, even near the equator, the summits of the Andes are covered with eternal snows. Though usually comparatively narrow, in Bolivia the chain widens out so that it is four hundred miles across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At places in Peru the summits are so near the Pacific ocean that branches of the Amazon river rise within fifty miles or thereabouts from that body of water. The Amazon is navigable for the greater part of its 3,400 miles of length, so that it practically bisects South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of its two hundred tributaries, a hundred are navigable. One of these tributaries is 2,300 miles in length. The Casiquiare, which flows into the Rio Negro, one of the branches of the Amazon, is also connected with the Orinoco. The Amazon contains one-tenth of all the running water of the globe, and is incontestably the world’s largest river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tides run up the Amazon four hundred miles. At a thousand miles from the ocean it is two hundred feet deep. At spring tide the bore, or pororoca, as it is called, rushes into the Amazon in the form of huge waves ten to fifteen feet in perpendicular height, three or four of which follow each other with irresistible force. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">mouth of the Amazon was discovered by Yanez Pinzon, in 1500; the river was descended by Francisco Orellana in 1540.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Amazon river system as a whole affords some 16,000 miles of river suitable for navigation. The forests along its banks are the largest in the world. The main stream flows almost along the equator.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The South American People</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Suppose you Avere asked to describe the people that go to make up the inhabitants of the United States. How would you begin? Would you describe the New England Yankee? the New York State Yankee? the Vermonter? the Knickerbockers? the Jersey Dutch? the Pennsylvania Dutch? the Michiganders? the Hoosiers? the Southerners? the North American Indians? and if so what tribe? the Negroes? the Irish-Americans? the German-Americans? the Italo-Americans ? Or how about the Japanese-Americans, or the Chinese-Americans, of whom we now have many thousands of actual bona fide citizens, born in this country and not knowing any other land? And don’t forget that we have Poles and Russians and Slavs and Hungarians and Greeks and French and Portuguese and Spanish, and their descendants, not a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best you could do would be to analyze the situation, pick out some of the leading groups, tell something about them, point to what they have accomplished collectively, and to the present situation, and there let it rest. That is what we hope to do in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Latin American is not one; he is many. Something over a hundred years ago Baron von Humboldt, one of the most discerning and thoughtful men the earth has produced, estimated that in Latin America there were 3,500,000 whites, 7,500,000 aborigines, 5,333,333 mestizos (persons of mixed blood), and 750,000 Negroes. It will be apparent that at that time the proportion of whites was about one-fifth, or 20 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the 1930 census there were then in the United States 108,864,207 whites, 2,019,696 aborigines and mestizos (including Asiatics), and 11,891,143 Negroes. The proportion of whites in the United States is 88.7 percent. North America is predominantly white; South America is predominantly dark. North America has always been inevitably governed by whites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The government of a country in which the whites constitute but one in five of the population is manifestly a very different proposition from one in which they make up seven-eighths of it. The whites usually govern in Latin America, but they do not always do so, and could hardly expect to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Governing Class</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Spanish Inquisition, by which 31,000 persons were put to death, was set up by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1481. In that same year began the Avar Avhich resulted, November 25, 1491, in the overthrow of the Moslem empire. On March 30, 1492, an order was issued for the expulsion from the realm of all Jcavs and Moors Avho did not submit to be baptized. On August 3,1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Palos on his first A’oyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the foregoing facts are kept in mind, one will readily discern the kind of immigrants that first found their way to Latin America. They Avere, first of all, Roman Catholics. The State took particular pains to see to it that none but the “orthodox” should go to the new Avorld. Thus North America Avas settled mainly by Protestants; South America exclusively by Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the second place, the first immigrants were soldiers by trade as xvell as soldiers of fortune. They had been engaged for ten years in the subjugation and expulsion of all persons not of the Roman Catholic faith, and their sovereigns Avere enthusiastic for the Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the third place, most of the skilled artisans in Spain had been Moors and much of the trading Avas in JeAvish hands, so that Avhen Moors and JeAvs Avere expelled, the country from which the adventurers set out Avas ill-fitted to provide the industry and skill needed to get on in a neAv Avorld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are thus forced to see that bigotry, cruelty, militarism and lack of industry Avere inevitable, at least at the start. But no sooner had Columbus made his discoveries than Ferdinand and Isabella Avanted gold, and in order to satisfy their demands he started the system of robbing the Indians of their treasures, Avhich has cursed Latin America from then till noAv. Greed was not limited to the sovereigns, hoxvever. It is a common enough trait of fallen man, no matter Avhere Ave find him. And the tropics promote laziness in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Trying to Understand the Spaniard</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No one can deny that the Spanish are possessed of great physical courage. They are chivalrous, and they are proud. They love beauty for its own sake. They admire the artistic. They love oratory and are adepts at it. Their language is filled with niceties of expression that can hardly be mastered in a lifetime. Etiquette is taken seriously and practiced assiduously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Spanish are musicians and dreamers. They love color and romance. In their semiseclusion of their women, they suggest to some minds the people of the Orient. It is thought, indeed, that Moorish customs, which prevailed on the Iberian peninsula for more than seven hundred years, have left an indelible impression upon the Spanish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The men love politics, but they do not love business. They place great emphasis on politeness, the fine arts, pleasures and the emotions. The balmy nights stir the emotions and the imagination. The color bar is not as great a handicap as in North America, but aristocrats and the descendants of aristocrats are liable to be arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Home life among the Spaniards is on a high plane, but the sexual morals of the cavaliers that first came to America were low, as may be judged from the great number of mestizos. Deeds of violence were common in the early days in Latin America as they were in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The aristocrats looked to the government to help them through this life and to the church to make it as comfortable as possible for them in the next. It was the Devil’s old game of Big Business, Big Politics and Big Church all over again. The only chance the common man had to get along was to be or pretend to be “loyal” to the people that had everything in their control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Extravagance is common. A Chilean or Peruvian thinks nothing of mortgaging his place for every dollar he can obtain and then will take his wife and six or eight children and go to Paris or to the Riviera for two or three years until he has used it all up. The Latins love luxury, elegance, refinement and ostentation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>The Hapless Aborigines</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">As the North American Indians are certainly descendants of the Japanese, so among the South American Indians there are distinct traces of Mongolian and Malaysian features. Photographs of life among the lowly resemble those taken in China. One can hardly tell them apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Spanish discoverers and conquerors gained control of the new world they wanted gold. The old Spanish law was that all treasures of the subsoil belonged to the monarch. Those who would engage in mining were granted villages of Indians, the inhabitants of which they were at liberty to compel to enter the mines and do the actual work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now having said many good things, many kind things of the Spaniards, we are forced to say that no other subject peoples have ever been treated as badly as the South American Indians were treated by the Spanish cavaliers. It is of record that only one out of ten forced into slavery ever returned alive. You can blame the spirit of the Inquisition for that. In instances obstinate Indians were dragged to the mines by tying their hair to the tail of the rider’s horse. Can you wonder that the Indian now distrusts the white?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Indians Have Made No Progress</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">The claim is put forth that in more than four hundred years of Spanish rule the South American Indians have made no progress, and that, as a matter of fact, they are less advanced now than they were in the days of Cortez and Pizarro. Today they are the indispensable hewers of wood and drawers of water without which Latin-American civilization could not go on. But they have not been rewarded. They have been kept in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An Indian, though he understands Spanish perfectly, will not answer a stranger, in that tongue, because he has come to fear it means some further plan to deprive him of that which is rightfully his. Nominally a citizen, actually the Indian is a sheep without a shepherd. What a blessing Jehovah’s kingdom will be to these poor unfortunates!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An item not to be overlooked is that the South American Indians, the Spanish and the Portuguese were all accustomed to be ruled by monarchs. Another is that for centuries Spain insisted upon ruling Latin America by men that were born in Spain. Even if a man was of pure Spanish ancestry, if he was born on this side of the water it militated against his chances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the caste system was really in effect: the Spanish-born at the top, next their American-born descendants, third the mestizos, and fourth the aborigines and Negroes, always at the bottom of the social ladder. The Spanish monarchs encouraged these four classes to feel contempt or envy for one another, according as they were up or down in the social scale, on the Devil's principle, “Divide and rule.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the reasons why there are so many political disturbances in South America is that this Roman Catholic policy of “Divide and rule” has been so persistently maintained. It is impossible to maintain a stable government where the various component parts of the population are studiously kept at loggerheads with one another. In the year 1930 there were seven major political disturbances in the twenty countries that go to make up Latin America.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Many Restrictions of Trade</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of following a policy that would develop the new world, Ferdinand and Isabella adopted one calculated to prevent its development. By the year 1501, only nine years after Columbus’ first voyage, royal licenses were required of all who wished to sail to the new world. These restrictions were continued for three hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By 1503 a law was in effect that all supplies for the Indies and all products from there must pass through the one port of Seville. By 1543, and for two hundred years thereafter, sailings took place only once a year in each direction, when a whole fleet sailed at one time, escorted by an armed convoy. On arrival at their destinations lively fairs were held to exchange Old World products for the new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to better collect the export and import duties at both ends of the line, the ports were restricted to three which were allowed to trade with Seville: namely, Vera Cruz, Cartagena and Porto Bello. No better system for stifling trade could have been devised. Wherever goods of any kind moved, fresh imposts were piled upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Spanish rulers forbade the trade in native products between various parts of Latin America, and for some inscrutable reason would not permit goods from the Philippines to enter Peru even as gifts. The Spanish sovereigns looked upon the whole country as theii' </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda,</span><span class="font7"> or private estate, and their major ambition seems to have been to make it pay and pay well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For two centuries their income was colossal, but much of it was squandered on foolish European wars. Firearms and superior organization enabled them to impose their will on a continent and a half. Piggishness caused them to lose it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thinking to remain more firmly in the saddle, the Spanish monarchs encouraged jealousies between the clergy and the lay rulers, and were always ready to listen to tales of the one against the other. Reactions to this policy of “Divide and rule” are to be seen in the instability of South American republics to this day.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>An Empire Easily Won and Lost</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">It was an easy thing for the Spanish cavalry, clad in armor, and possessing firearms, to crush or eliminate the aborigines, first in the islands, and then in Mexico and Peru. The natives had never seen horses, and were terrified at the appearance of warriors mounted, armor-clad, and able to kill at great distances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the lands seized were assumed to belong to the crown. They were parceled out to the whites. The great landed estates and the system of forced labor which they created has continued until today. The effort of the Spanish sovereigns to control all trade led to much smuggling and gradually the colonies lost most of their respect for the mother country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At first the sovereigns demanded a two-thirds share of all the output of the mines. This was too great to be borne. It was finally reduced to one-fifth, and on that basis yielded the rulers an average of something like $2,500,000 a year for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The merchants of Cadiz, by a handsome gift to the royal treasury, finally got the monopoly away from Seville, and thereafter all vessels to and from the Indies, as Latin America was called, went through the better harbor which for almost two hundred years had been coveting the trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The South American revolution, when it finally came, lasted twenty years. It resulted, toward the close of the year 1824, in the breaking of the Spanish power in South America. Oddly enough, it had its start in an uprising against Joseph Bonaparte, who had been placed on the throne of Spain by Napoleon in lieu of the supposedly legitimate king, Ferdinand VII.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fifty years before the Spanish colonies gained their independence Britain is said to have frequently agitated the idea of revolutionizing them and separating them from Spain, with the avowed object of opening up the continent to British commerce. The plans which Britain made for enlarging her trade with South America proved a success. Before the World War British interests constructed and controlled eighty-live percent of South America’s railroads, harbors and public works, fifty percent of the shipping, commerce and finance, and a large part of the industrial and agricultural activity. But the Germans were making inroads into British trade as the great war broke out in 1914.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Soft Berths for the Clergy</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">As a rule, if a father has a son who he feels will never make a success at anything in life, he makes a clergyman out of him, and boys of that kind easily and naturally fall into that line of occupation or lack of occupation. The prophet sizes the whole class of the clergy up so faithfully, in Isaiah 56:10,11, that we do not see how anybody could miss the point. They just naturally love to eat and drink and sleep and pamper their bodies; but when it comes to lifting the weights they have placed on the people, the Lord says, they will not put forth a finger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy that set out to make a soft living in the New World were no better and no worse than the clergy in general. At the start they had it so soft that almost everybody wanted to be a clergyman rather than have to do work of any kind. Who wants to work up callouses on his hands if he can strut up and down beside a &quot;church”, with a long-tailed robe on, learning Latin pages of “Eenie, meenie, minie, moe”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the year 1600 at least four hundred convents existed in New Spain alone. In 1620 the convents in Lima covered more ground than all the rest of the city. In the year 1644 the civic authorities of Lima petitioned the king to forbid the establishment of any more monastic orders, and to limit the revenues of the existing ones, as otherwise they would soon own all the property in the country. At that time there were more than 6,000 of the clergy that had no charges and were hoboing it through life. If any hoboes read this issue we trust they will forgive us for this comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1501 Alexander VI gave Ferdinand and Isabella the right to collect tithes for the propagation of the “faith”, and in a few years they had the incomes from annates and indulgences, and the right to make all ecclesiastical appointments. This was because they were such zealots for the Inquisition.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The “Reduction” of the Heretics</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">It is not such a nice business, burning people at the stake. We sometimes do it here in the United States, but it is not popular. There are nice, refined people that object when a Negro screams in the vicinity of their home as some white gentleman bores through his abdomen with a white-hot crowbar. It never just got to be considered the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so the regular Ferdinand and Isabella system of dealing with “heretics” never got a really good foothold in the New World. Only 41 were reported as having been burned alive in Mexico, and 59 in Peru, but this total of exactly 100 looks suspicious. It looks as if the figures had been doctored. There may have been several times that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The usual milder punishments were inflicted, of flogging, work in the galleys, banishment, imprisonment, or death by some relatively humane method. Confiscation of property took place in all of these cases, as it enabled the clergy to go that much longer without doing any work. The Dominicans were specially entrusted with the “reduccion” of the “heretics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “reduccion” of the natives, i.e., their reduction or restoration to the supposed religion of their ancestors, was accomplished by less violent means. The images of the gods of the Aztecs and Incas were renamed or replaced by representations of Jesus, Mary, and the “saints”. The eagle on the Mexican coat of arms was replaced by the dove, so that the “Holy Ghost” would not be left out. The natives were already familiar with “religious” processions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twelve friars accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, and the work of the “reduccion” of the natives began at once. Their records were destroyed and great pains were taken to sec that they should be taught nothing but the ‘purest’ Roman Catholic doctrine. The missions were sometimes called “reducciones”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Apportionment of the Lands</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">As the Spanish soldiers overran the New World, they<sup>7</sup> and the priests that went along with them were granted the lands of the conquered aborigines and were given the “right” to wholly or partially enslave the natives. This “right” awarded by the crown was called a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">repartimiento.</span><span class="font7"> After the person who held the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">repartimiento</span><span class="font7"> died or was banished, his heirs or successors came into possession of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">en-comienda</span><span class="font7"> which he left behind. They could levy tribute and “evangelize”, but were restrained from going to as great length as the original holder of the “right”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It thus came about that the aborigines lost their lands to the Spanish aristocracy. The New World became a paradise for priests, friars and nuns, but assuredly not for the poor aborigines. Force, bribery, intrigue, cruelty and treachery bolstered up the union of church and state and left all the burdens of militarism, aristocracy and churchianity piled upon the backs of the simple-hearted natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As early as 1516 a Spanish priest Bartolome de las Casas, who happened to have a heart and a conscience, protested against the branding of the natives and the forcing of them into bondage. As neither the soldiers nor the priests would work, and the natives were unaccustomed to bondage, Las Casas visited Spain, urging the Spanish government to import Negroes into the New World on a large scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In later years, after his advice had been taken and great numbers of blacks had been shanghaied from their African homes and transported to America, Las Casas bitterly regretted that he had not earlier seen that the Negro has as much right to be free as the Indian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One would not expect soldiers or priests to be good teachers of how to perform the labors of the Held and forest, and so the ox came to be the animal generally used for agricultural labor. Wooden plows, often made from the forked branches of a tree, were used. Grain crops were cut with knives. The mills on the sugar plantations were worked by hand, oxen or water power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">General Education Neglected</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As early as 1523 Pedro de Gante had a school in Mexico in which he taught a thousand Indian boys reading, writing, arithmetic, drawing, music, trades and mechanical arts, but the good example which he set was not followed, and the Indians today, after four hundred years of Roman Catholic “teaching”, are less advanced than they were when Cortez landed in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first Catholic University in Latin America was opened in Mexico city in 1551, eighty-five years before the founding of Harvard University, the oldest university in the United States. By that time (1636) there were several well established universities in Latin America. But they were only for the education of priests and the children of the aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the Roman Catholic church retains its control of the men through its control of the women, every effort was made to keep the women in ignorance. The few schools for girls were in the hands of nuns, and education beyond the barest rudiments was frowned upon. It is of record that one priest in Chile refused absolution to a girl who had confessed to the sin of studying French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic church looks upon woman as a means by which great numbers may be ultimately added to the church. Whether the poor woman knows how to take care of her brood does not matter, only so long as she brings them into the world. The priest makes a good thing out of it in baptism fees, masses and what not, whether the children live or die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The women of South America are good mothers, in the sense that they love their children dearly, but among the poor their knowledge is so slight, kept that way by the “church”, that from forty to ninety percent die under two years of age. The children are often “spoiled”, though externally most polite to father and mother. The daily confession of the woman of the home makes the priest the real head of the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most men wish to have their sons educated away from the influence of the priests, but the pressure brought to bear upon them by their wives is so strong as to usually prevent this. The men generally feel that the church is outmoded, belongs to the past. But they do not see how to get aw’ay from it. And, indeed, only the great Jehovah God could bring the deceptive and oppressive institution to an end.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Brighter People Nowhere</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Nowhere will you find brighter people than in Latin America; and, given equal opportunities, they make their mark every time. By inheritance and training they incline more toward the literary and artistic than toward the mechanical and commercial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is of the nature of the South American that he will receive a North American, with utmost politeness and elegance of language, in a room that for ornateness and elegance of furnishings could scarcely be surpassed, and yet the room may be so cold that everybody has to wear an overcoat to keep from freezing. The first thing a Yankee would do under such circumstances would be to say, “Gee whiz! it is cold in here; can’t you give us a little heat ?” And it would be the last thing the Latin American would think of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It takes a North American a long time to learn that the more leisurely and courteously he does a thing, the sooner and more pleasantly he attains his end. If he tries to rush things, they just don’t rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the credit of the Roman Catholic church it must be said that though they did encourage the making of slaves of the aborigines, yet they did not encourage the breaking up of their families, as was done often in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were only eight printing presses in Spanish America up to 1810. Throughout the inquisitional period book dealers were required to furnish lists of all books they had on sale and to take oath that no others were sold. They had to keep on hand lists of the books that were under ban. They might not buy a library without obtaining permission from the censors for every book it contained. No books could be imported without their consent. The officials of the Inquisition had the “right” at any time to enter any home in search of condemned publications, the same as any other regular jail.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>In the Good Old Yellow-Fever Days</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">In the good old yellow-fever days there was no sanitation. The garbage was thrown out into the streets, to be carried away by the buzzards, as was also the case in some of the cities of North America. Since then we have sewers, paved streets, and garbage disposal, and thus no more yellow fever. The oft-repeated yarn that vaccination has made the change is pure fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The artistic sense of the people made the town square an attractive place. In it was usually a fountain from which the poor secured water for household uses. Some of the streets were lined with trees, and many of them were fairly wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At night, in the early days, the streets were dark and deserted and deeds of violence were common, but in the latter part of the eighteenth century oil lamps were set up along the most important streets and police patrols were instituted. Mexico city set an unusually high precedent and early established the reputation of being one of the cleanest, safest and most beautiful cities in the world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Monroe Doctrine</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">We do not feel called upon at this time to make any further statement of the history and purposes of the Monroe Doctrine than is contained in the following, taken from Judge Rutherford's book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font7"> (Book One, pages 287-289). It covers the ground completely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The imperialism of America dates from December 2, 1823, with the “Monroe Doctrine”. In substance that doctrine is that European monarchies or governments must not by conquest acquire territory and rulership over the countries of North and South America and make them colonies and thereby enlarge the territory of the European nations. The doctrine, however, does not declare against the United States’ enlarging her territory on the Western Continent at the expense of minor American republics. America did make war with Mexico and took over Texas. She made war with Spain and established a protectorate over Cuba and Porto Rico. She also acquired title to the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and Samoa and Guam, and thereby enlarged her territory. She has established a protectorate over Santo Domingo, Haiti, and has recently put in operation a military policy in Nicaragua. She has acquired the Canal Zone and Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True to the traditional policy (to wit, diplomatic hypocrisy) of the two-horned beast, the ostensible reason for the Monroe Doctrine was to protect the infant republics of the American continent. The real reason was in the interest of Britain and America; and in support of this conclusion the following historical fact is related: “The European power commonly called the ‘Holy Alliance’ [the chief amongst which was Germany, the head of the sixth beast] . . . turned its attention to Spain and to the Spanish colonies. The United States feared that France would undertake this commission also and would claim Cuba as the price of service to Spain, thereby securing a broader foothold in America.” To show that Great Britain was deeply interested in the policy of the Monroe Doctrine, and that Britain and America were working in conjunction with each other, the following historical fact is cited:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The time seemed to have come in 1823 for some sort of action that would head off the threatened invasion of Latin America by third parties in behalf of Spain. Something was also needed to check the Russian advance into North America ; and the opportunity was convenient for expressing the undying love of Americans for the popular government that they had chosen. At this moment George Canning, Foreign Minister of Great Britain, stepped into tho controversy. England was interested in unrestricted trade with the Spanish-American countries and was extremely opposed to the constricting policy of the Holy Alliance, both in Europe and America. Hence, in August and September 1823, Canning four times proposed to Richard Rush, our Minister in London, that the United States join England in a declaration against intervention, and Monroe was inclined to accept the proposal. After long Cabinet discussions John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, convinced the President that it would be better to make an independent declaration. Adams’ papers show that he not only suggested but formulated most of the important presidential message of 2 Dec. 1823, several passages in which, construed together, constitute the original and genuine Monroe Doctrine.'’—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font6"> Vol. 19, p. 374.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As with the League of Nations compact, an American president got the credit for writing the Monroe Doctrine, but it really emanated from a fertile British mind. In support of this conclusion the following historical fact is important:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The original Monroe Doctrine was at once effective. Canning was so much interested in the result that he claimed it for himself and said (21 Dec. 1826) : ‘I looked another way ... I sought for compensation in another hemisphere. ... I called the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old.’ ”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font6"> Vol. 19, p. 374.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same authority further says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“During the Spanish War of 1898 Great Britain made it clear that other European powers must not interfere with the American policy of the United States.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font6"> Vol. 19, p. 375.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Latin America Resentful</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Latin America is resentful and suspicious of the purpose of the Monroe Doctrine; and who can blame her? By the time you have been robbed a dozen times by the same man you get to discount his professions of friendship and wish he would put up his gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">La Prensa</span><span class="font7"> gracefully but forcefully phrased it: ‘'The gracious benevolence with which one State would guarantee the independence of others is strictly outside international law and engenders the danger that there may arise a false vision of the possibility of tutelage and protection, which is absolutely inadmissible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yankees and Spaniards do not naturally mix very well together. The Yankee is blunt, cold, content to wait on the law and will take and give a substitute; and he is a Protestant. The Spaniard is the opposite of all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Pan-American Union at Havana, in 1928, thirteen of the Latin-American countries made it clear that they do not want any government to intervene at any time in the affairs of any American state. While they did not mention the American Government, yet all knew what they had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The munition manufacturers of North America have been and are a curse to South America. The fratricidal conflicts of Latin-American nations are fought with North American weapons and financed sometimes, too, in the great nation that has more than half of the population of the Western Hemisphere and vastly more than half of its capital. Our tariffs have made us unlovely and unloved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brigadier General Smedley D. Butler says he has been on fifteen debt-collecting expeditions with United States battleships, but it seems that the North American State Department says it shall never be done so again. We shall be good now; so we shall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both North America and South America are sore because South American bonds have lost some 80 percent of their value. But what can be done about it? Not a thing. The phantom of prosperity is just around the corner, the big corner, Armageddon. Meantime we have to be content with oui’ “rugged individuality”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The polite language of South America is French. Travel is almost entirely to Europe. There is in Latin America little if any feeling that the United States has any real interest in its welfare. That was a nice speech by the new Peruvian ambassador wherein, with true Latin-American courtesy and nicety of expression, he said: “You have changed from indifference to mild interest, but we want it to be converted into friendly interest. We have changed from hostile distrust to hopeful expectancy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Mr. Hoover was president of the United States the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> represented him as saying on one occasion: “We are not attempting in any way to develop a super-state or- to interfere with the ‘greedom’ of action of any of the States.” “Greedom,” Mr. Hoover, “greed-om”? How come?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Good Relations Essential</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">It is essential that good relations should be established and maintained between North America and South America, even if there were no other motive on the part of each than pure selfishness. The South Americans are learning that by hooking up with North American firms they make money; so today many who in bygone years would have learned French are learning, not English, but the language we speak in the L’nited States, whatever that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The direct investment of United States capital in all Latin-American countries is estimated as around $5,500,000,000. Cuba, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil have been the largest borrowers. Colombia, Peru and Bolivia follow in the order named. Peru and Bolivia have already defaulted on their bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One thing that holds back South American progress is that most of the countries have but few tilings they can export; it is coffee, sugar, copper, lead, tin, nitrates, wheat or corn or it is nothing. If the export prices of these are down, then the country is down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">South Americans complain that they should not have borrowed as much as they did, and would not have done it, but that the loans were pushed on them and they were told to sign on the dotted line. That is all true. That is the way North Americans do business. The North Americans could see that South America has fabulous natural resources, only needing to be linanced to be an El Dorado. And it is that and will be that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tourist traffic between the United States and Latin America is on the increase, even in the midst of the great depression. That is a favorable sign. South America is still taking automobiles, electric equipment for the home, office appliances, machinery and motion pictures made in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">North Americans have learned that South American revolutions are not such serious affairs as they were once considered to be. Often thev arise from the fact that commanding officers come to feel that their regiments belong to them personally. They get out of focus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is acknowledged that governmental favors are distributed too generously, for much the same reason. But in the long run the republics to the South, even if they do have shake-ups, manage to jog along as smoothly as the rest of the world. Personal greed is prevalent in every corner of Satan's kingdom; it is not peculiar to Latin America.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>“The Mimic God”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font7">OW kind but how plain was Judge Rutherford’s address on “The Mimic God&quot;, broadcast October 8, 1933, from the same great chain of over one hundred stations that carried the address the week previous on ‘‘The True God’’, of which mention was made in our last issue. Due provision will be made for putting these two addresses, together with the concluding one of the series, “Why Serve Jehovah,’’ in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We say just a few words here, reflections of the message that came in from WEBL of Syracuse, eighty miles away. One would have thought Judge Rutherford was in the room. Every word was as clear and distinct as could be. In the early morning it seemingly threatened rain, but the witnesses said, “It will not rain; it never does; there will be no static until after the address,” which was scheduled for the noon hour. And sure enough, the skies cleared and at the hour of broadcast conditions for perfect reception were ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford started his address with a definition of the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mimic</span><span class="font7"> as he expected to use it in his delineation of the one that has deceived and blinded and oppressed the whole world. We do not have it by us at the moment; it was excellent. As shown by the dictionary, a mimic copies or imitates something that he feebly or remotely resembles, but the copy that he makes is ridiculously small or insignificant as compared with what is imitated. That is a good word to describe the conditions set up in the visible and the invisible world by the one who made merchandise of man in the garden of Eden, the one whose ambition was to be like the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of selling mankind into slavery and death Lucifer's name was changed by Jehovah God to the names Satan, Devil, Serpent and Dragon, and he has been all of these. He challenged Jehovah God to put on the earth a man that would maintain his integrity; Jehovah accepted the challenge. All the sufferings that have come upon man have come from Satan.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Religion Ever the Devil's Tool</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Strange to say, religion has ever been the means by which the people have been turned against Jehovah God. The first religions in the earth were sketched by Judge Rutherford in his address. They all had creatures as their object of worship. Israel alone of all the nations of the earth had the opportunity to know the truth. God commanded them that they should have no other gods before Him. All bowing down to man is an insult to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Israel was untrue to her opportunities and in COG B.C. was cast away, and from that time the whole world has lain in the wicked one. Because it did lie in the wicked one, Jesus must suffer from Satan and his wicked agents, thus maintain His integrity and thus vindicate God's word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most religious people of Uis time, the scribes and Pharisees, claimed that Jehovah God was their father, but Jesus told them plainly that their father was the Devil. “His servants ye are to whom ye obey.” Men who, though with the best of intentions, follow the teachings of men instead of the true God, are in fact servants of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the people are so blind to the Scriptures is because of the Devil. The apostle plainly so states in 2 Corinthians 4:4. Satan’s real purpose in this is to turn the people away from Jehovah God, but, ‘Let God be true though it make all men liars.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil has for centuries been the invisible ruler of the earth. Commerce, politics and religion are joined together in his government of the world. The governments of earth have not knowingly followed the Devil; they have been overreached. It is because of this that the nations of the earth are now in great distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world is in suffering and in great distress, not from anything that the true God has done; this distress is from the false god, whose race is now about run. Preparation is now progressing for the destruction of the Devil and those that have his spirit and do his bidding. The Devil has great wrath, knowing that his time is short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this perilous time, how shall the people know what to believe? The true God has made the necessary provision for those whose hearts are right in Uis sight. Jehovah’s witnesses come to you with the very help that you need. These witnesses are peacemakers, not trouble-makers.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>No Opposition to Rulers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">To oppose the rulers in their efforts to straighten out a mad world would be entirely wrong. If the rulers were wise they would pay attention to the great truths now being proclaimed in their hearing. The Scriptures plain-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ly show that in the conclusion of all this strife it will be seen by all that survive that Christ is now reigning upon Jehovah’s throne; in other words, He is Jehovah’s vicegerent in the earth. ‘‘The government shall be upon his shoulder,” and of the increase of that government there shall be no end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We do not say that these are the things that Judge Rutherford said, but they are the impressions left in memory’s gardens. All should get the address and read it thoughtfully. By the time this issue is in the hands of our readers, the third and concluding address, “Why Serve Jehovah God,” will have been delivered over the big network, October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We live in a time when the judgments of Jehovah God are beginning to operate in the earth. In our last issue, page 3, occurs the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The heaviest pressure was brought to bear in New England, where the city of Providence cringes under the lash of a bigoted bishop. In that city two station managements broke their contracts and gave up their manhood and independence, because covertly threatened with a boycott which it was hinted would include 400,000 Catholics. The owners of these stations had other businesses which they foolishly believed would be ruined unless they complied with the threats.

<p><span class="font7">That paragraph was written on Monday, October 2. It had reference to William A. Hickey, bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Providence. At that time, so far as we know, he was in perfect health. Only three days after the time when Judge Rutherford was lecturing over more than 100 radio stations (after Bishop Hickey had used all his powers to have him cut off the air altogether), we understand, the gentleman had a very sudden and a fatal heart attack. Shortly prior thereto (i. e., Monday, October 2) the ‘pope’ had cabled him his “blessing”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Bishop Hickey died on Wednesday, October 4, and his funeral was conducted three hours after Judge Rutherford had finished his second address, the subject of this article. Because this item is of some human interest, we quote from the account in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> of October 9, the day this is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Providence, R.I., Oct. 8. A throng estimated to exceed 50,000 persons jammed the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul here today to file past the bier of the Most Reverend William A. Hickey, Bishop of the Diccese of Providence, who died on Wednesday. The body of the bishop was borne to the cathedral at 3.30 P.M. to lie in state for two and a half hours, but at 10 P.M. the square and all the streets in the vicinity of the cathedral were still impassable because of tho crowds, and the steady procession into the church had not abated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Burial will take place, after the imparting of five pontifical absolutions, in the marble crypt beneath the main altar in the lower part of the cathedral beside the bodies of his five predecessors and former auxiliaries of the diocese.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are 51 instances of imprecatory prayer in the Scriptures. We do not know that Bishop William A. Hickey was the subject of any prayers that he might get his just deserts for standing by and worshiping and serving </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the mimic god,</span><span class="font7"> and trying to prevent a faithful man of God from broadcasting over the radio his appeals to the people to turn to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the tiue God</span><span class="font7"> of the Scriptures; but we know that he is now cold in death, and that Judge Rutherford is very much alive and is due to broadcast over 104 stations this coming Sunday noon, on another coast-to-coast network, “Why Serve Jehovah God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Looks as if he had all the best of it. Read the 92d Psalm, all of it, thoughtfully. If verses 7 and 9 do not interest you, it will be hard to find anything that will.</span></p>

Free speech, free thought, reform, growth, new ideas, become more and more intolerable to tyrants, and so must inevitably be stamped out by banishment, killings and machine guns. As we were betrayed in the great war by our politicians, diplomats, religious teachers, economists and governments, so now we are being betrayed by our great bankers, railway presidents, great industrialists and again by our economists and our governments. We are today in the grip of the sinister tentacles of the great octopus of capitalism, which has brought us to our present miserable state.”</span></p>

If one gave him $1 the tip was referred to, in the presence of the bride, as “one lousy buck”. A $2 tip was good for a “Thank you. God bless you.” And so on up. At length the income tax collectors heard about the big drawer full of money which he was accustomed to exhibit to prospective bridegrooms, as part of his tipcollecting program; an investigation was made, and it was found that the “cheap skate” deputy had received $69,000 in tips in two years, and $21,000 in interest on savings accounts in thirty-four banks, and had forgotten to report his pickings in income tax statements.

All together, the American investments total more than $1,250,000,000. To work the immense sugar estates their owners import every year cheap labor from adjacent islands, and this the Cubans much resent.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">HY farmers get next to nothing for milk is readily comprehended when one considers that until recently the president of the National Dairy Products Company received a salary of $180,000 a year, and yet that last year the company netted $12,000,000 after $18,000,000 of profits had been written off to avoid income taxes. The milk business, for the big distributors, is so profitable that it paid the abovenamed concern to purchase in Washington, for the sum of $4,250,000, the plant of the Chestnut Farm Dairy which was valued at only $1,65G,-000. Another reason why the farmers get next to nothing for their milk is that officials of the cooperatives, supposedly organized to protect the interests of the producers, are guilty of making marketing agreements antagonistic to the interests of the farmers. Only an imbecile could be convinced that a dealer in Chicago can sell milk for (ijc and make money, while one in Philadelphia must have 14c; and yet the producer in the latter case receives no more than in the former, and in either case is inadequately repaid for his work.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>World Digs for Water to Drink</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font7">IS the year 1933 (A.D.). The darkness over the earth is gross, almost pitch black. As the earth’s inhabitants grope around in the darkness, to them it is so dense that they can feel it. In the houses and minds of a few people on earth, Jehovah’s witnesses, there is light, and some of the people of earth, people of good will, catch some of the light that is reflected by these witnesses. (Suddenly there is flash of lightning, another one of those frequent flashes of spiritual lightning which have flamed forth from the very temple of God Jehovah for the past fifteen years. This recent zigzagging stream of lightning lights up all quarters of the earth and causes a brighter illumination of the whole world situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Look! see that international gathering of men over there in London, at the World Monetary and Economic Conference? Yes, but what are they doing? Digging! What! those statesmen and representatives of sixty-six nations of earth digging? Yes; for can’t you see that their tongues are hanging out for thirst, and the great stream of world commercialism is turned to blood and stinks, and these men are famished for water to drink? In the various countries from which these men have come they have had great diggings for water, especially since A.D. 1924, but only bloody waters have responded to their spades and steam shovels; and that’s why they are there at the world’s greatest city, London. If they can’t get pure water, capitalism, nay, more, ‘‘civilization,” so called, will dry up and die miserably! Ah, can’t you see now ? this is nothing but a reenactment on a complete and world-wide scale of a great prophetic event down in the land of Ham, Egypt, thirty-five hundred years ago. That ancient Egypt, and its haughty Pharaoh, and its Nile river winding along like a great dragon, find their antitypes or parallel fulfilments in our own modern day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Back there the great God of the universe, Jehovah, had sent the Hebrew prophet Moses down into Egypt to serve notice of His purposes upon Pharaoh and to lead forth God’s chosen nation of Israel out of the house of bondage in Egypt. In sending Moses to Egypt and using him in connection with the Israelites Jehovah used certain things and creatures which symbolically represented greater things to come. Moses represented or foreshadowed Jesus Christ at times. In fact, God caused Moses himself to write: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">like unto me;</span><span class="font7"> unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15) Confirming this statement, Jesus said: “Moses . . . wrote of me.” (John 5: 4G) Accordingly Peter, an apostle of Jesus, testified that Moses was a type of Christ Jesus.—Acts 3: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pharaoh and his organized world power, Egypt, pictured or represented Satan and his cruel organization. It was in Egypt, the symbol of Satan’s world, that the Israelites, God’s chosen people, were domiciled, having been sent there by Jehovah that His purpose might bo carried out. The Israelites primarily represented Jehovah’s chosen people in Christ; and secondly, all of those who take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and who maintain their integrity toward Him. Jehovah gave three signs for Moses to perform before the Israelites, and Moses’ brother, Aaron, was associated with him therein. Two of those signs were performed before Pharaoh. Jehovah would first supply the evidence and convince the Israelites that He had sent Moses to them, and then He would also give proof to Pharaoh, this to be a warning to Pharaoh and his organization. Both the Israelites and Pharaoh must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God. Both the people of Jehovah and those of Satan’s organization must now be informed that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first sign was the rod of Moses which was thrown to the ground and became a serpent. That sign pictures how, in A.D. 1914, at the end of the time of Satan’s rule over earth without divine interference, Christ Jesus is sent forth to begin His reign and He extends or projects His active all-power to things pertaining to the earth. Thus He did when the war in heaven took place, resulting in the casting of Satan and his angels down to the earth. Now there is but one center of disturbance, to wit, the earth, where Christ Jesus keeps a watchful eye upon the enemy and by His power holds the enemy in restraint until God’s due time for the enemy and his organization to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The second sign was that of smiting the hand of Moses with leprosy and thereafter healing it. But the third sign is of peculiar interest to commercial “Christendom” today. Said the Lord God to Moses: “And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.’’ —Exodus </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font7">: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was out of the river Nile that Moses took the sample of water. Egypt depended upon that river for her wealth, business and commerce, and hence it pictured particularly the commercial part of Satan's organization. The Devil, as pictured by Pharaoh, claimed that he made that ‘ river” and that it belonged to him. (Ezekiel 29:1-3) It was chiefly the commercial support of Satan's organization. It was chiefly the commercial element that Satan used to bring about and carry on the World War. The commercial part of his organization has afflicted the world with its doctrines or propaganda, and it is Satan’s commercial element that is chiefly responsible for the economic difficulties and depression now upon the people, causing them much distress and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the picture Moses took up the water out of the Nile and poured it on the dry ground; and now the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, and also those of His organization, take a-sample of Satan’s commercial organization, represented by the water, and give attention thereto. As the people of ancient Egypt thought the Nile waters were good for drinking purposes, so the people of the world, including many of the consecrated people of God, have thought that the commerce of the world is vitally essential and is refreshing and life-sustaining; and hence some of the Lord's people have engaged in the commerce of the world (presumably to &quot;make money to support the Lord’s cause&quot;) and later have come to sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The water which Moses took out of the Nile he poured upon the dry land. At that time many people who were no part of the official organization resided in Egypt. Today there are many in the world who form no part of the official organization of Satan and who are completely out of heart sympathy with that organization. These include that class of consecrated people who will yet have to go through “great tribulation” to prove acceptable to Jehovah (Revelation 7: 9-14), and also the class of people often mentioned as “people of good will”. Seeing that the Scriptures mention the “dry land” in contrast with the “sea”, the “dry land” would well represent both the consecrated people and those order-loving people on earth who have a sincere desire to see righteousness established among men.—Haggai 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The performance of the three signs was primarily for the purpose of establishing the faith of the Israelites, who foreshadowed God’s covenant people now on earth; and the performance of two of these signs before Pharaoh and his court was secondarily for the purpose of serving notice upon Satan's representatives. Correspondingly, Jehovah has recently first shown His anointed people that commerce is the mainstay of Satan’s visible or earthly organization, and this Jehovah has done in order that the people of God might be strong in faith and active in proclaiming the divine truth against that commercial part of the enemy organization. This proves that Jehovah’s witnesses must pour the truth upon the “dry land”, that is, upon the consecrated and the order-loving people; they must do so in the presence and hearing of Satan’s representatives in order that all may have an opportunity to know that Jehovah is God. Jehovah’s anointed people do now know that the commerce of the world is not life-sustaining; the people of good will and disposed toward God's kingdom are learning the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To Moses Jehovah said: “The water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.” Thus today Jehovah shows His people, and those of good will, that commerce originated with the Devil, that it is the most powerful part of Satan’s organization visible, and that Satan has employed it to carry on his bloody and death-dealing work for centuries past upon the nations of the world. This being true, that “water” is not fit to drink, and those who are in a covenant with God to do His will and yet who drink that “water” shall die, and not live. Not only the consecrated ones, but also the people of good will, see that if they would live they must flee from Satan’s oppressive organization and take their stand on Jehovah's side. For the benefit of His covenant people Jehovah caused to be written: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”—1 Timothy 6: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that commerce or big business is a part of Satan’s organization and is oppressive and death-dealing Jehovah began to make known to His people first in 1927, as the historic facts show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s covenant people have believed and rejoiced in these great truths that have come to them by His grace, and now the Lord emphasizes the necessity for them to use these ways and means which He has given them and to bear substantially these truths before the rulers of the world. Moses and Aaron duly appeared before Pharaoh and performed the first sign, which only angered Pharaoh and hardened his heart. Then Moses performed the third sign before Pharaoh, which sign proved, in fact, to be the first one of the ten plagues which came upon Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah told Moses that Pharaoh would defy the first sign and refuse to let the Israelites depart out of Egypt. Then to Moses Jehovah said: “Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.” (Exodus 7:15) The rod which Moses had used before Pharaoh to perform the first sign he was now told by Jehovah to take in his hand and to stand by the brink of the river Nile. The use of that rod pictured the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, Christ Jesus, as carrying into operation the purpose of Jehovah by virtue of the power and authority which Jehovah had delegated to Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The appearing of Aaron before Pharaoh, and his acting under the instructions of Moses, pictured Jehovah’s witnesses on earth proceeding under the direction of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, to appear before the Devil and his organization and to serve notice of God’s purpose to take action against that wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On encountering Pharaoh at the river’s brink Moses, according to God’s instructions, was to say: “The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his seiwants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.”—Exodus 7: 1G-2L</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a modern parallel of this, Jehovah by His “Hand”, Christ Jesus, now sends forth His witnesses, His “remnant”, to bear His testimony before the peoples of the world and to serve notice upon the rulers that the time has come for the people of God to go to the mount of God, that is to say, to the Kingdom, and to give their allegiance to Jehovah; and to tell them that God’s kingdom is the only hope for the world, and that Satan and his organization must cease to hold the people in subjection and bondage. In the performance of the third sign before Pharaoh Jehovah foretold that the loathsomeness of commercialism would be made to appear before the people and the rulers. The pouring of the water upon the dry ground shows to those who have the hearing ear that commercialism is death-dealing and is dead, and cannot lift the people out of the great depression which Satan has brought upon them. It is of significance that the part of Egypt known as “the land of Goshen”, where the Israelites were then domiciled, was not spared from the plague of blood on the ground; and this would seem to clearly teach that the people of God on earth are not spared from the effects of the great commercial depression that is now upon the world. This is exactly in accord with the facts as they now exist. It was only with the coming of the fourth plague upon Egypt that the land of Goshen was severed or separated from the effects of the plagues which Jehovah sent upon Egypt.—Exodus 8: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fulfilment of the prophetic picture made by Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh has at least begun, and there is much evidence to show that the same has been fulfilled. When Jehovah turned the waters of the Nile into blood, that was notice to Pharaoh, and hence to Satan and his organization, that commerce is done for, and is as good as dead. This was the third sign, and corresponded with what is described in the book The Revelation respecting the vial and the trumpet used by the third angel of a group of seven. The Revelation says: “And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, 0 Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they [“Christendom’s” rulers] have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy [to have to drink it]. And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.” (Revelation 16:4-7) “And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star [the Devil] is called Worm-■wood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.” (Revelation 8: 10,11) These prophecies began to have fulfilment as recently as A.D. 1924, the year of a great gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses from many countries of the world at Columbus, Ohio, U. S. A. That was five years before the financial crash came upon the world, in 1929; and issuing forth from that Columbus convention the warning to Satan and his organization was given in the form of a resolution termed “An Indictment” and an accompanying speech, widely published in many lands, declaring that “civilization is doomed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s organization never contained life-giving waters, although the people had been induced to believe that commerce is essential to the sustaining of life and the welfare of the nation. The water poured out and turning to blood upon the dry ground in Egypt pictured how the policies and methods of commercialism have deluged the nations of the earth with blood shed in violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant concerning blood (Genesis 9:1-6), and hence the death-dealing influence upon the peoples. For this reason commercialism as a part of Satan’s organization is doomed to complete destruction. What Jehovah has been doing thus far is to have His testimony declared to the rulers and to the people, to show them that commerce, as well as other parts of Satan’s organization, is without power to give life and blessings to the people. Jehovah’s witnesses are now doing theii* part in declaring this testimony, and later Jehovah, by His executive officer, Christ Jesus, will destroy the entire organization of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note that the express purpose of performing the first and third signs is that the rulers and the people may receive notice. “Thus saith the Lord [to Pharaoh and Satan], In this thou shalt know that I am [Jehovah].” This is further proof that Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to declare the testimony of Jehovah until every part of Satan’s organization goes down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Pharaoh the Devil’s representative was supported by his magicians, even so now with the Devil and his representatives on the earth, who attempt to counteract the effect of the testimony of Jehovah. The record (Exodus 7: 22, 23) says: “And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaob’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto [Moses and Aaron]; as the Lord had said. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.” Today the clergy “magicians” of Satan’s organization make the waters of truth to appear bloody by teaching the rulers their allies, and the people that will listen to them, that the business depression and suffering upon the people is a punishment from God sent upon them because of their unfaithfulness in supporting religious systems. To this effect the pope recently made a public statement, and millions of people are induced to believe such false statement. The result is what Satan desires, namely, the turning of the people away from God. The clergy and the other allies in wrongdoing now display their hardness of heart by crying out that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a commercial enterprise of selling books for pecuniary profit, and that by going from house to house to give the testimony and doing this without obtaining a license from worldly authority these witnesses are violating the commercial laws of the land. In this manner the modern magicians attempt to turn the waters of Jehovah’s testimony now being delivered by His witnesses into that which is deathdealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses serve the rulers with notice which is Jehovah’s testimony that their commerce, as well as all other parts of the worldly organization, will shortly be destroyed by the Lord. The political magicians cooperating with their allies threaten the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, and declare that it is a menace and hence death-dealing to the people. Big Business magicians are now desperately trying to work magic before the Devil. They claim that there are regular periods of depression and prosperity, and that business moves in cycles, and that within a short time now prosperity will come again; hence they have sent forth the expression commonly heard: “Prosperity is just around the corner, and will soon be present.” The claim of big business is that these financial depressions are necessary evils (symbolized by blood) and will ultimately result in good. Every part of Satan’s organization discredits Jehovah and His kingdom, while Jehovah’s witnesses continue to tell the people that the kingdom of God is the only hope of mankind. The commercial, political and religious elements of Satan’s visible organization attempt to prove to the people that they have power to rule and to remedy the present evil conditions, and they continue thus to cast reproach upon Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>Digging for Water</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">All the rulers of the earth, big business, politicians and clergy, and those that support them are now desperately digging for ways and means to sustain their organization and to pull them out of the hole. This was particularly foreshadowed by what the Egyptians did, as it is written (Exodus 7:24): “And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.” The world is full of unemployment, and men in every commercial enterprise are desperately seeking if they can find the means to sustain life. Since the beginning of the financial depression, in 1929, many makeshifts have been brought forward by the wise ones or magicians of the world in their efforts to dispel the depression, which has resulted from the bloody waters of commerce. These schemes or plans consist of moratoriums, reconstruction, finance corporations ostensibly organized to help the people, but in fact to keep the head of big business above the waves, that it may survive and not die. Conferences are held by the representatives of nations, coalition governments are organized, and divers and numerous suggestions made as to how “water” that is now blood or death-dealing may be made pure and life-sustaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the latest things that have been brought forward is that satanic scheme of “technocracy”, which offers a new system to replace the world’s worn-out economic machinery. The new system suggests that nobody work more than two hours a day and everybody would be happy and comfortable. Of course, this is a pure delusion, as Jehovah’s witnesses well know. Other schemes or plans advanced are such things as a campaign of buying and only of goods produced by one’s own nation, tax-sales law, repeal of prohibition, the manufacture and sale of beer, and the hypocritical scheme known as “The National Economy League”. All these things, of course, ignore Jehovah God and give no heed to the repeated proclamations of truth that the present depression is the result of the end of Satan’s world, and that he has forced this condition upon the world for the purpose of turning the people away from Jehovah, and that the only sure and adequate remedy for mankind is the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is in no manner responsible for the trouble that the world is now experiencing. The turning of the waters of the Nile into blood was not Jehovah’s curse upon the waters, nor did it illustrate or picture any curse from Him upon the nations now. Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt for the express purpose of bearing Uis testimony before the rulers and the people to show them that He is the Almighty God, the Most Iligh over all the earth. The signs performed before Pharaoh were for that very purpose, that Pharaoh and his organization might know that Jehovah is God, and might let God’s people go to God’s mountain. The testimony of Jehovah now being delivered by His witnesses is not God’s curse or expression of His wrath, but rather notice for the information and warning of the rulers and the people that Jehovah is God, that Satan’s time is at an end, and that Satan’s schemes are death-dealing, and that if Satan does not relinquish his power to rule Jehovah will shortly destroy his organization. As Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and God permitted him to remain in power for a time, even so now Jehovah permits Satan’s wicked organi-</span></p>

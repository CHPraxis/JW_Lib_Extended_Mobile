<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully djobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth ean come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>EVERLASTING STRENGTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”—Prov. 18:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH has made known to those who love him his provision for their preservation, and upon Jehovah’s provision they can and do fully rely. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font4">has also announced his purpose to fully recompense </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">wicked. The net result is that all creation shall know that Jehovah is the almighty God. The text chosen for 1932 emphasized the truth that all shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">brought to a knowledge of Jehovah. The text chosen specially for 1933 is “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower”. This text is particularly precious and comforting to the anointed remnant just now, because we are in that time when Satan is making war on the remnant with the wicked design to accomplish their destruction. Gog, the chief of Satan’s army, with his wicked forces now surrounds the remnant, in this, that the remnant are domiciled temporarily in the realm of “Christendom” and the wicked forces of Satan under Gog are on every side and expect to destroy Jehovah’s people now on the earth. Gog and all of his forces will fail in that wicked enterprise. In order that the remnant may receive aid, comfort and encouragement in this time of great crisis Jehovah by his beloved One, the Chief Shepherd, feeds the people of God upon food convenient to them, which means that the remnant are informed of the provision for their full protection and preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> To understand the difference in the meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a name </span><span class="font4">as applied to the creature and as applied to the Creator will help us to appreciate the aforementioned year text. The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font4"> as given by a creature and applied to a creature is merely a title by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font4">that creature is known or designated. A name applied or given to a creature by Jehovah means much more. The Scriptures show that distinction. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">created the beasts of the field and the fowl of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">air and brought them to Adam and he named them; meaning that Adam gave each of these creatures the title or name by which it is known or desig</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nated, </span><span class="font4">and the name means nothing more. Likewise </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">when a </span><span class="font4">child is born to a man and woman they give </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">it a name. </span><span class="font4">If the father is named John and the child </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is a son </span><span class="font4">the child may thereafter go by the name of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">John </span><span class="font4">Johnson, or the son of John. In this way the name Johnson originated with some nationalities and is merely a title by which that family is designated or known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> When Jehovah gives a name to a creature there is a much different meaning attached to that name from merely an appellation or means of identification. For instance, there was a man known as Abram, and because of his faithfulness God changed his name and thereafter he was known as “Abraham”, which means that God had purposed that this man should be the father of a multitude or many nations. (Gen. 17:5; 22:17,18) When God sent his beloved One the Logos to earth he commanded that his name should be called “Jesus” because he is the Savior of men. (Matt. 1:21; Luke 1:31-33) God also commanded his angel to announce that Jesus should be “called the Son of the Highest” because he is Jehovah’s duly appointed and anointed King who is made Head of Ihe kingdom of Jehovah, that is, his capital organization. Concerning this beloved One and the meaning of his name, Jehovah caused Isaiah to prophesy that “his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, . . . The Prince of Peace”, his name thus signifying the great offices he should hold. (Isa. 9:6,7) So the Scriptures disclose that whenever Jehovah gives a name to a creature there attaches to that name a specific meaning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Of still and far greater significance and importance is the name of the Creator. He has revealed himself to his faithful creatures by various names, each one of which carries a deep meaning. It is written that “the angel of Jehovah appeared unto [Moses] in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush”, and then Jehovah spoke to Moses and told Moses that he had been chosen to go to Egypt to deliver God’s people from their oppressors. Moses inquired of God as to what he should say to the Israelites as to who had sent him when they should ask that question. Moses said: ‘When they shall ask, What is his name? what shall I reply?’ “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: . . . say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.” (Ex. 3: 1-14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font4">Thus Jehovah revealed himself unto Moses, not as one that had a beginning and who might have an ending, but as I AM, that is to say, the Everlasting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One, without beginning and without ending, in fact the Only Being. The term “human being” is wholly incorrect; because man is a creature, and not a being. There is but one being, and that is the Eternal Creator. The Creator is the being; all things created are creatures.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The Eternal One had appeared unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty, but was not known to them as Jehovah. (Ex. 6: 2, 3) He revealed himself to Moses*by his name Jehovah, saying: “This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” The name “I AM” is from the same Hebrew root as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font4"> The name “I AM THAT I </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AM”, </span><span class="font4">according to the marginal reading of that text in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version,</span><span class="font4"> is, “I AM, BECAUSE I AM,” or, “I AM WHO AM,” or, “I WILE BE THAT I WILL BE.” His name </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font4">signifies his purpose concerning his creatures, and this is further shown by the statement to Moses concerning the Israelites, to wit, “I WILL bring [them] up ... I WILL put forth my hand ... I WILL give this people favor. Ex. 3: 13-22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The name </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font4"> means Creator; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font4"> the one with limitless power; the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Most High,</span><span class="font4"> the one above all; but wherever </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font4"> is used it has reference to the Almighty One’s purposes toward his creation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Frequently the Scriptures reveal the Most High as “Jehovah of hosts”, meaning the purpose of the Almighty God to successfully tight battles for his people, and against his enemies. (1 Sam. 15: 2, 3; 17: 45; 2 Sam. 5: 10; 7: 26, 27; Ps. 24: 10) Jehovah having purposed to do a thing, there is no deviation from that purpose and there is no power that can withstand the Almighty God in battle as he carries forward his purpose. “The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?”—Isa. 14:24,27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah chose Israel as a people for himself. He delivered them from Egypt and made a covenant with them at Sinai, led them through the wilderness, and then said to them: “But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit, . . . then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.” (Dent. 12:10,11) Jehovah God in carrying out this express purpose chose the city of Jerusalem and caused it to be built and caused the temple to be built there, and he put his name there. That meant not merely a place of worship, but it meant that Jehovah had placed his chosen people Israel there and that his purposes concerning them should never fail so far as Jehovah is concerned. The failure of the Israelites was due to their lack of faith in God and lack of faithfulness to the terms of the covenant God had made with them. (Heb. 4: 2) When the Israelites were faithful and obedient to God he protected them from their enemies and fought their battles for them, and that he did for his own name’s sake because he had placed his name upon that people. Israel being God’s typical people, and hence forming his typical organization on the earth, what came to pass upon that people were ensamples and were written down for the benefit of God's people on earth at the end of the world. (1 Cor. 10: 11) The lesson that the antitypical Israelites, God’s chosen people, get from this is that Jehovah’s purpose toward his people is certain to be carried out and cannot fail towards those who are in a covenant with him and who continue faithful. To thoroughly learn and appreciate this lesson now gives aid, comfort and hope to the remnant. Only those who have an appreciation of Jehovah’s name will now enjoy real consolation. To such his name is and will continue to be a strong tower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEMY VICIOUS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> During the past few months the enemies of God’s people have been particularly active and vicious. The master enemy of Jehovah is Satan the Devil, and the Devil is employing the services of his earthly representatives to persecute those who are on the side of Jehovah. In times past the clergy have chiefly indulged in slandering the humble and faithful witnesses who serve Jehovah God; but at the present time not only do they indulge in slandering these witnesses, but, together with Satan's commercial agencies and the “strong-arm squad”, they continue to harass, persecute and imprison Jehovah’s witnesses. This vicious action on the part of the enemy has increased to a marked degree in very recent months. Throughout the realm of “Christendom”, and particularly in the countries of Canada and the United States, Jehovah’s witnesses are being arrested on the false charge of violating the commercial laws of the land, and such prosecutions or persecutions are based upon the alleged fact that these faithful men and women are going from house to house engaged in a commercial business. Are Jehovah's witnesses actually violating the commercial laws of the land? They are not in the slightest degree. They are going from house to house preaching the gospel of God's kingdom, even as they have been commanded by Jehovah to do. Even if their thus preaching the gospel would constitute a technical violation of man’s law these witnesses of Jehovah would still be doing right as long as they are doing only what Jehovah God has commanded them to do. The law of God is far higher than the law that man can make. If the kingdom is here and Christ has begun his reign, why then would Jehovah permit the enemy to continue to persecute his witnesses as they are doing? Why do they not go on in the proclamation of the kingdom message unhindered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The foregoing questions are now frequently asked by those who are followers of Christ Jesus, and there must be and there is a Scriptural answer that is entirely satisfactory and which answer, when understood, brings comfort and encouragement to God’s remnant. A real follower of Christ Jesus does not need encouragement as an inducement to serve Jehovah God, but he does need the proof satisfactory to himself that he is actually serving God and has the approval of the Most High and which proof is a sustaining power to enable him to continue steadfastly in the performance of his duty. Alan’s greatest privi</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lege is to </span><span class="font4">be on the side of Jehovah God. Satan, however, endeavors to bring about conditions to induce man to believe that God has forsaken him. Alan therefore needs to continually feed upon the food convenient for him, that is to say, that which builds him up in the most holy faith, and which food Jehovah through Christ Jesus the chief Shepherd is now furnishing his people. By reason of God’s favor in providing this food the remnant are made strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. It therefore clearly appears that it is a vital necessity that each one of the remnant continue to keep abreast with the great truths that Jehovah reveals to his people from time to time. “Study to shew thyself approved unto God.”—2 Tim. 2: 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Some of the facts that strengthen and sustain Jehovah’s witnesses, and which must now be kept in mind, are these: Jehovah God ‘has taken out a people for his name’. (Acts 15: 14) That means that Jehovah has taken out from amongst men a class of persons who at Jehovah’s fixed time must declare his purposes, because his name Jehovah stands for his purposes toward his creatures. The remnant therefore have a definite duty to perform. For many centuries Christian people understood that God sent Christ Jesus into the world to die in order that men might believe and, being faithful in believing, might ultimately go </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">heaven. While this is true, it is not by any means the entire truth. God sent Jesus into the world chiefly to be a witness to the name of Jehovah the Most High, hence to tell the truth concerning Jehovah’s purposes. (John 18: 37) Jehovah appointed Jesus and anointed him to be the King of the world. Then Jehovah proceeds to take out from amongst the world men who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">willing to faithfully follow in the footsteps of Jesus even unto death, and to these the promise is given that if they continue faithful in the performance of their commission they shall share with Christ Jesus in that kingdom. There is a particular work to be done in order to be faithful to that commission, and this must be done by those taken out for his name; and that work requires them to be witnesses for Jehovah. Their testimony must be given at a time when the great question- at issue is to be settled and which question is, Who is the great supreme One? The time for giving that testimony is when Jehovah sends his King forth to rule amongst the enemies. It is then that the people ‘taken out for his name’ must be willing to act and do willingly act in obedience to God’s commandment. (Ps. 110:2,3) That time is now here and which time began immediately following the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah and the gathering unto himself of his faithful followers. These faithful ones, the remnant, were then brought into the temple, anointed and commissioned as the witnesses of Jehovah, and must act at this very time. These are the ones to whom Christ Jesus the King and chief officer of Jehovah says: “I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city [organization] of my God, . . . and . . . my new name.” (Rev. 3: 12) Thus it is proved that upon the faithful remnant God has placed his name. It is to this same faithful remnant class that Jesus says: “I . . . will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written.” (Rev. 2: 17) It is this same class that Jehovah addresses when he says: “Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.”—Isa. 62: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Why has Jehovah given the faithful remnant a new name which his mouth has named and which name Jesus says is ‘the name of my God and of his organization’? Certainly the reason is not to get this class into heaven, but that such may stand forth before the world as the exponents of Jehovah’s name, that is to say, the class that tell of his declared purpose. These must testify that Jehovah is the only true God. For this reason Jehovah says to them: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” In order to maintain their integrity towards Jehovah the remnant, as his witnesses, must be faithful in the performance of their commission, and this faithfulness must be demonstrated under conditions that constitute a real and crucial test upon those of the remnant.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Who will force conditions upon Jehovah’s witnesses that constitute such a great test? The enemy, of course, with the expectation of destroying these witnesses of Jehovah. “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12: 17) “Dragon” in this text stands for Satan and his organization. Both that part of his organization which is invisible and that which is visible to human eyes are included in this term. Religion has ever been used as a screen behind which Satan has operated to deceive and to oppress the people. The most powerful part of his visible organization, however, is the commercial division thereof which he has builded up and uses to oppress the people and keep them in subjection. In these last days, Satan’s religious representatives, particularly the clergy, being unable to successfully keep the people in ignorance of the truth and being unable to withstand the clear and forceful speech of God’s anointed remnant, Satan calls into action and to the aid of the clergy other parts of his visible organization. He causes Jehovah's witnesses to be charged with a violation of the worldly law of commerce because they go from house to house </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font4">books containing the gospel of the kingdom and are thus preaching the gospel of the kingdom. To hinder and, if possible, prevent this preaching of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">gospel </span><span class="font4">and to destroy the witnesses Satan calls into action his crowd of hirelings, who are men without conscience and who for their own daily bread are willing to persecute, arrest and wrongfully treat the witnesses of Jehovah. Such oppressors include police officers, magistrates and executives of municipalities who do the bidding of their master. These do the bidding of Satan because they are hirelings, and these constitute the ‘ ‘ strong-arm scpiad ’ ’ of the visible part of Satan’s organization.—Ezek. 30: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The remnant must keep in mind that God has warned them that Satan would attempt their destruc</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tion at </span><span class="font4">the present time. The chief active agent of Satan, and who is leading this persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses, is Gog. The conspiracy men</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tioned by </span><span class="font4">Jehovah’s prophet in the following text </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">already formed and is now being carried into operation. ‘ ‘ For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4">taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Come, and </span><span class="font4">let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.” (Ps. 83: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2-5) </span><span class="font4">This explains why within the realm of “Christen</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dom” </span><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are being persecuted upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the pretext </span><span class="font4">that they are violating the commercial laws </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font4">land. To continue steadfastly in the work of giving testimony to the name and purposes of Jeho</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">vah </span><span class="font4">amidst such a cruel and wicked persecution is a real and crucial test upon the remnant. Without a knowledge of God’s precious promises and his sustaining power they would be unable to stand in this test. Those who receive Jehovah’s final approval are, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">however, </span><span class="font4">being faithful under the test and will maintain their integrity toward him, even as Job, for ex</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ample, </span><span class="font4">maintained his integrity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“AGAINST THEM”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Is </span><span class="font4">Jehovah permitting his witnesses to be perse</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">cuted </span><span class="font4">as a test to them that they may thereby prove their integrity ? That is one of the reasons; but there </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">another and a far more important reason, and this </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">latter </span><span class="font4">reason the remnant must keep in mind at all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">times. The </span><span class="font4">vindication of Jehovah's name is at hand. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">One </span><span class="font4">of the means of vindicating Jehovah’s name is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">destruction of all of his enemies; but before this </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is done </span><span class="font4">he has commanded and commissioned the faithful servant class to serve notice upon the enemy </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">and concerning the day of impending destruction. Jehovah does not take action against his enemy by secret. He has chosen the remnant, a people taken out for his name, to serve notice upon the enemy now. Hypocritical religion, oppressive commercialism and cruel rulership soon shall cease for ever. The members of Satan’s organization will be destroyed, but only after due notice of Jehovah’s purpose to destroy them. God’s Word discloses that he will give members of Satan’s organization ample opportunity to identify themselves with Satan the enemy. Jesus said to his faithful followers: “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to councils [courts] ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.” (Mark 13: 9) Stated in common parlance, the Lord declares that these faithful witnesses shall be arrested and dragged into court at the instance of the clergy, and that thus their faithful devotion to Jehovah will constitute a witness against the ones of Satan's organization who are responsible for such persecution. The Lord will cause the enemies to convict themselves by their own wrongful course of action. This they will do after receiving notice from God. The chief reason, therefore, why Jehovah permits his witnesses to now suffer persecution at the hands of men is in order that these persecutors may identify themselves as of Satan’s organization and hence against Jehovah God. Keep in mind, then, these two separate and distinct reasons why this persecution continues, to wit, (1) as a test upon the remnant, and (2) to afford opportunity for the peoples of the world to identify themselves with Satan’s organization and as against God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FORESHADOWED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> The Scriptures clearly prove that Jehovah’s executioner and his work of execution were foreshadowed by Jehu and the work which Jehu did in the name of Jehovah God. He foreshadowed ‘the elect servant of Jehovah’, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Chief. Jehu therefore primarily foreshadowed Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s executioner, and incidentally foreshadowed the members of the ‘elect servant’ class, particularly the remnant, because such, being Jehovah ’s witnesses, are of his organization and have part in making known Jehovah’s purpose of executing his vengeance upon the enemy. The remnant do no executing by way of actual destruction; but by reason of being members of the ‘ elect servant ’, which servant executes the judgments written, the remnant are counted in in the executing work. All of the servant class are included in this honor.—Ps. 149: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Jehu was on his way to execute God’s judgment against the worshipers of Baal, that is, the Devil religionists, when he came upon Jehonadab. Jehu said to Jehonadab: “Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord”; meaning, Come and see how vigorously I will prosecute the commission that Jehovah has given to me. Jehonadab went along with Jehu and witnessed the execution of the Baal worshipers. (2 Ki. 10: 16) These Baal worshipers foreshadowed all of those who willingly put themselves on the side of the Devil and against God. Jehu proclaimed a solemn assembly for Baal. There was a great gathering of such at the house of Baal. To the vestrymen Jehu then said: “Bring forth vestments [that is, garments of identification] for all the worshipers of Baal.’’ This was done, and each one put on the garments or vestments and thus voluntarily identified himself as a Devil worshiper. Even so now Jehovah commands his witnesses to go to the people and declare that Jehovah is God and the purposes he will accomplish through his kingdom; and those thus hearing and who then persecute Jehovah’s witnesses or otherwise oppose him do by their course of conduct clothe themselves with the vestments of the Devil and thus identify themselves with the Devil’s organization and against Jehovah God. In harmony with the language of Jesus ‘they testify against themselves’ and convict themselves. By their course of action, therefore, they are for ever estopped from saying that they did not willingly take their stand on Satan’s side and against Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> When the Baal worshipers had thus identified themselves and were massed in the house of the Devil, Jehu commanded his men to ‘go in and slay every one of them, and let not one escape’.—2 Ki. 10: 23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Thfe acts of Satan’s earthly representatives in identifying themselves must first take place before the final slaughter at Armageddon, and the opportunity is being furnished to them to so identify themselves; and this they are doing after hearing the testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses. These faithful witnesses of Jehovah are suffering for righteousness’ sake, for the sake of Jehovah’s name. While such suffering and persecution afford opportunity for them to maintain their integrity toward God, yet the far more important reason for their persecution is that they might be used to give the opposers of God an opportunity to identify themselves as God’s enemies before their destruction. This is done in vindication of Jehovah’s name, and in this the remnant have a part.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Furthermore, while Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in giving their testimony to the people and suffering persecution because they so do, they also bear testimony to the people of good will. That class of people of good will was foreshadowed by Jehona-dab, and these are now given an opportunity to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. These persons of good will, the Jehonadab class, learn that Jehovah is the only true God and the only power that can deliver them from their oppressors. The Lord Jesus is now at the temple of Jehovah for judgment, and the peoples of the world must be informed of that fact. This information or testimony must be given by Jehovah’s witnesses, that the oppressed may have an opportunity to learn the way of escape and, above' all, to learn that Jehovah is their refuge. “And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.” (Ps. 9: 8-10) The oppressed people of the world are suffering and crying because of such oppression, and Jehovah God in his mercy hears their cries; and those who are humble, that is, who desire to learn the truth, will be given the opportunity. “Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.” (Ps. 10: 17,18) The obligation is laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses to inform the people of the provision made for them through the kingdom of God. In giving this testimony the remnant must expect to be persecuted by Satan and his agents. Every one of the temple class will have a part in this testimony. (Ps. 29: 9) Every one of such is the object of the enemy’s assault. Shall any of the remnant be fearful and draw back and slack the hand or fail to give the testimony, because of sueh continued cruel persecution? The faithful will do their duty.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STRONG TOWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The situation as now revealed to those who love Jehovah is this: That the greatest fight of all time is beginning and within a very short time will reach the climax. It is the fight of Satan and his wicked hordes against the Lord.of righteousness Christ Jesus, who is the special representative of Jehovah. This fight includes the remnant, but it is Jehovah’s fight. He is “Jehovah of hosts”, and therefore the remnant are absolutely assured that Jehovah’s organization shall triumph. Satan and his forces are desperately attempting the destruction of all those who take a positive stand on the side of God and righteousness. The remnant are in the van of Jehovah’s people on earth and are singing the praises of Jehovah and should expect to be assaulted by the enemy. Without a question of doubt all the remnant would be destroyed instantly except for the protection the Lord throws around them. In this hour of great peril Jehovah speaks to his people and says: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” (Prov. 18: 10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> This is a general rule of Jehovah made and applied at this particular time, and is applied beneficially to all who bring themselves within that rule.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME A FORTRESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> A tower is a place of refuge and security from the assaults of the enemy. There were a number of giants amongst the Philistines. The army of the Israelites under the leadership of David were often assaulted by these giants. The last one of that giant crowd to he slain was &quot;a man of great stature, that had on exery hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes”. The number six, being symbolic of imperfect things, particularly pictures or represents Satan’s organization at the time of its greatest power at the end of the world. Jt is written that those giants ‘‘fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants”. (2 Sam. 21: 22) That six-fingered and six-toed giant pictures Satan’s organization at the present time. David was a type of and foreshadowed Christ Jesus, who will destroy Satan’s organization. Members of the ‘elect servant' class, including the remnant, are associated with Christ Jesus. Recognizing the protection which the Lord Jehovah had furnished to him, immediately following the victory over these giants David wrote and sang this song: ‘‘[Jehovah] is my rock and my fortress, and my deliverer: the God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (2 Sam. 22: 2-4) Now we have come to the time when Christ Jesus, the Grcatcr-than-David, and who is the tower of Jehovah’s organization, is leading the fight against the enemy for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Mic. 4: 8) It is the time of the greatest ci isis, and hence God’s anointed people have the greatest need for an impregnable fortress; and such place of refuge is fully provided for them, and that refuge is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">name of Jehovah.</span><span class="font4"> Attention is here called to the fact that emphasis is laid upon the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font4"> as appearing in the year text: ‘‘The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah is a strong tower.” This text plainly appears to say in substance that at the time when Jehovah will vindicate his name he sends forth his people whom he has taken out for his name and commands such to be his witnesses telling that he is the only true God; that he has put his name upon these and thus he has furnished them a special fortress of refuge. These constitute the remnant and are the special objects of Satan's wrath. But they boar the name of Jehovah signifying his purpose toward them, and they need not fear. To them Jehovah says: ‘Fear not the enemy. You are my witnesses, and you go forth by my appointment.’ (Ezek. 3: 9) ‘‘But T am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The Lord of hosts is his name. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isa. 51: 15, 1G) It is by the name “Jehovah of hosts”, meaning ‘the God of successful battle’, that he here reveals himself to his anointed people and informs them that they are in his protection; and thus he gives to them consolation and full assurance. To his witnesses or faithful ones the name of Jehovah is a fortress. That means that those to whom Jehovah has given his name are secure from all harm as long as they remain true and faithful to his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> This conclusion is further supported by the words of the psalmist, who wrote at the dictation of Jehovah. Those of the temple class, the anointed remnant, are now in the secret place of the Most High. Concerning them it is written: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” (Ps. 91: 1) While under the shadow of the Almighty no power can successfully assault them. With full faith and confidence the remnant now speak: “I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.” (Ps. 91: 2) Concerning the faithful remnant, now a part of the ‘elect servant’ class, Jeho'mh says: “Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I delixer him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.” (Ps. 91:14,15) In this great fortress, Jehovah's name, the remnant are safe, and they say: “And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.”-—Ps. 27: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Righteousness is counted only to men who believe in God and in Christ Jesus and who then joyfully render themselves in obedience to the law of God. According to this rule the members of the remnant class are righteous. They have the name of Jehovah, and his name is their strong tower. “The righteous runneth into it, and is safe [R.V., </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin,</span><span class="font4"> is set on high].” Truly the righteous have hurried into this high tower. On July 26, 1931, at the Columbus convention, God’s people seeing and appreciating the fact that Jehovah had given to his people a new name, they joyfully accepted the same. They literally ran into that tower of everlasting strength. Not only did that convention adopt a resolution declaring their joy in the fact of having received their name at the mouth of Jehovah, but all over the earth faithful companies of God’s people hastened to thus declare themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Shortly after coming to a realization that they had received the new name from Jehovah the faithful remnant were permitted to see that Gog is the chief officer of Satan in the execution of a great conspiracy against those who are devoted to Jehovah God. As the faithful remnant continues to press forward in the witness work Gog hurls his wicked forces against them. The assault of the enemy against Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be successful, however, for the reason that ‘the name of Jehovah is their strong tower’. We are now in the day of Jehovah’s judgment, and it is the day when those who love God must be bold in the declaration of the truth. (1 John 4: 17, IS) The faithful remnant are exhibiting this boldness due to their full confidence in Jehovah God. When one or more of their number are arrested by Satan’s officers of a certain town, the remnant in recent days have formed themselves into larger companies and have gone into the vicinity and witnessed to all the people of a town in one day. God has commanded them thus to do; and his law they will obey regardless of any law that shall be enacted by worldly powers and which worldly law attempts to abridge or hinder the forward movement of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Some municipalities have enacted ordinances which provide that no person can go from house to house soliciting or selling anything without first obtaining a permit from the police department so to do. Shall Jehovah’s witnesses comply with this ordinance and refrain from preaching the gospel unless a permit is issued? Such ordinances do not apply to Jehovah’s witnesses, for several reasons: They are not soliciting or selling anything, but are engaged <sup>;</sup>n preaching the gospel by exhibiting to the people that message of good news in printed form. They are obeying God’s positive commandment to preach the gospel with boldness at this time. (Matt. 24: 14; Isa. 43: 10, 12; Ezck. 3: 2-5) To ask law officers for a permit to do what God commands them to do would be entirely inconsistent. Even the courts of the land take judicial notice that Jehovah’s law as set forth in the Bible is superior ro man-made law. By the law of Jehovah his obedient witnesses must preach the gospel. The law of the land could not rightfully interfere with such preaching of the gospel. The Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the land, expressly declares that there can be no rightful interference. Then it follows that Jehovah’s witnesses must obey God’s law, and it also follows that no state or municipality could enact and enforce a law providing for a permit to be issued to do that which it could not lawfully prevent. The apostles recognized this rule when they said to the courts: “We ought to obey God rather than men. Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4: 19,20; 5: 29) It is entirely consistent and proper, however, that Jehovah’s witnesses file with the police officers their names and addresses and inform such officers that they intend to preach the gospel in their community, and ask such officers to see that they are not interrupted in their work of preaching the gospel, and then proceed to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> For the remnant there is but one way, and that way means continuous and faithful service to Jehovah Their safety depends upon their faithfulness. If faithful they cannot be destroyed, because they are in the fortress. They cannot be taken ; and the everlasting arms of Jehovah continue to bear them up. Everlasting strength is therefore exercised in their behalf. Let it be remembered, however, that Jehovah is not taking this action in behalf of the remnant because the remnant arc of intrinsic value and bring value to him. Jehovah is so exercising and continuing to exercise his power in behalf of the remnant for his own name's sake. It is the time for the vindication of his name. No longer shall his name be dragged in the dust. He will now vindicate it that all may know that he is the only true God. Having purposed it, he will accomplish his purpose. Those who have taken his name and who continue faithful are certain of safety, because they bear his great name.—See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 267.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Members of the remnant must now maintain their integrity toward God. This can be done only by the faithful performance of the commission Jehovah has given to the remnant, which commission requires them to be his faithful and true witnesses and to boldly declare his name and his purposes. Such commission cannot be fulfilled by merely saying, “I love Jehovah.” Words mean nothing unless accompanied by consistent action. We are now in “that day” concerning which Jehovah says: “Call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.” (Isa. 12:3,4) The fulfilment of this commandment by the remnant can be accomplished only by their taking a bold initiative in making known the name of Jehovah and by declaring that the time is here for the vindication thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The fight is on, and will continue until Jehovah destroys the enemy, and this will be done as soon as the serving of notice is completed. The part of the remnant is to sing forth the name of Jehovah, and by this they draw upon themselves the fire of the enemy. Arrests and persecution will continue against God’s people, but let none of the remnant be for one moment discouraged. While the witness work is going forward those of the enemy class, and who are the worshipers of Satan, are donning the garments by which they openly identify themselves as God’s enemies. Thus they prepare themselves for destruction. The faithful remnant in bearing witness to Jehovah’s name will suffer inconvenience and probably much persecution, but these things will in no way deter them from the faithful performance of their commission in doing the work which God has given them to do. The remnant now constitute the van of Jehovah's visible organization on earth and are marching on to final victory under the leadership of the great Field Marshal Christ Jesus. With gladness they see and believe the words of the Lord: “Be not afraid nor dismayed . . . ; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” (2 Chron. 20: 15) At the head of their column is their standard; inscribed upon it are the words which bring them confidence and full assurance: “The' name of Jehovah is a strong tower.” They appreciate the precious promises found in his Word, amongst which are: “Our help is in the name of Jehovah.” (Ps. 124: 8, .4 /?.V.) “Thy name, () Jehovah, endureth for ever.” (Ps. 135: 13, zl./i.T.) The remnant are now fully assured that everlasting strength is exercised </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">their behalf because they bear the name of Jehovah and are privileged to have a part in the vindication of his Word and holy name.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>GATHERING UNTO THE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">EHOVAH GOD, through his prophet, foretold the gathering of his faithful people to himself, say</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing: </span><span class="font4">“Gather my saints together unto me; those</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.’’ (Ps. 50:5) The covenant by sacrifice there mentioned is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">covenant or solemn agreement which God made with Jesus when Jesus presented himself to God agreeing to do his will as recorded in the sacred Scriptures, even to the point of laying down his life as a sacrifice </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">God’s cause. This covenant was made at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Jordan river at the time of the baptism of Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Into </span><span class="font4">that covenant others were later invited, the condition being a full devotion to the Lord God even unto death, the basis of the covenant being the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, by which all who offer themselves to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord God </span><span class="font4">are made acceptable. Many have agreed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to do </span><span class="font4">God’s will; but the mere making of a covenant </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is not </span><span class="font4">sufficient. The one who is favored by being brought into that covenant must prove himself faith</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ful and </span><span class="font4">true by performing his part of the covenant. Manifestly from the words of the prophet some would </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">prove </span><span class="font4">faithful and some unfaithful. The gathering </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font4">saints or devoted ones unto Jehovah takes place when the Lord eomes to his temple, as foretold by the prophet Malachi (3; 1), and puts his professed people</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>CHIEF CORNER STONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">to the test. The approved ones are gathered unto the Lord by being brought into the temple condition and by being builded up as a part of Zion or God’s organization. (Ps. 102:16) The faithful ones are the ones who have the loving-kindness of Jehovah, because they are devoted to him and are objects of his love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This same scripture text, in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> translation of the Bible, is rendered in these words: ‘ ‘ Gather yourselves unto me, ye my men of lovingkindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.” At the appointed time the faithful ones separate themselves from the unfaithful by reason of the wise and faithful course that they take. When the examination is had and the Lord finds them faithful, he sets them aside, or separates them, into a company for his own purposes. (Isa. 43:21) These therefore constitute what the Scriptures call “the remnant”. It is against this remnant class that the enemy specially directs his attack, because they are the only ones faithfully representing the Lord on earth; and they freely and joyfully offer themselves in the day of the Lord, and rejoice to do what the Lord gives them to do.—Rev. 12:17; Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah caused his prophet to foretell a secret place for those who were gathered unto the Lord. In Psalm ninety-one, verse one, it is stated: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” This prophecy could not have its fulfilment until the Lord came to his temple, at least so far as the church on earth is concerned. No one could be in the secret place of the Most High unless that one is a part of the Lord’s organization. When the examination is made and the approved ones are found, the Lord takes them into Jehovah’s organization and there they are safe. If they continue faithful unto the Lord, they shall abide or remain for ever in that place of security. Hence the prophet says: “Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.”—Ps. 91: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be in the secret place of the Most High means to be within God’s organization with Christ Jesus the Head of Zion. No one could enter that secret place unless he has first been begotten or brought forth as a child of God and has thereafter responded to the call to God’s kingdom and has been chosen and anointed with the spirit of Jehovah, and then proves faithful to the covenant for the kingdom, and is brought into the temple of the Lord and thereby made a part of God’s organization. In this prophecy of the ninety-first Psalm, verse eleven, it is written: “He shall give his angels charge over thee.” The word “charge” here used means an enjoining upon one or more the care and custody of another. (Zech. 3:7) It is God who does the appointing of the angels, and it follows, therefore, that the angels are a part of God’s organization, and that those who constitute the remnant, and who are brought into the secret place of the Most High, have the special protection which God has provided for them by the good offices of his angels. The Scriptures show that God uses holy angels as his messengers, and that they are a part of his organization; and when the faithful remnant become a part of his organization, they have this special protection of the angels.—Luke 1:19; Ps. 34:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus was about to be taken by the mob which the traitor Judas led to the garden of Gethsemane to arrest Jesus, the Apostle Peter smote off the ear of one of the mob. Jesus reproved Peter and said to him: “Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matt. 26:53) Undoubtedly the legions of angels then stood ready to go to the assistance of Jesus and were subject to his command. That the Lord God gives special aid and protection to his faithful remnant, who are brought into his organization, is made certain by the words of the prophet, namely: “He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.” (Ps. 91:15) There is a special reason for this protection, and this will be considered in a later issue of this magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three thousand years ago Jehovah God commanded that the wise king Solomon should build a house or temple in Jerusalem unto the name of the Lord. (1 Ki. 5:5) The Lord directed the preparation of the material for this house. The result is recorded in the first book of the Kings, chapter six, verse seven, which reads: ‘ ‘ And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither [to the site of the temple]; so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house while it was in building.” The building of Solomon's temple was a prophetic act. It foretold the building of the spiritual house or temple of God, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (Heb. 3:6) The “spiritual house” of the Lord, as the Apostle Peter (1:2: 3-5) calls it, is built up of living stones. God caused his prophet Isaiah (28:16,17) to write: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">, The fact cannot be overlooked that this prophecy refers to the time of judgment in connection with the laying of the “chief corner stone”. The laying of the stone here mentioned by the prophet has to do with God’s organization. What is meant by the stone? The Scriptures frequently speak of Jesus Christ as the King. Those faithful followers who become part of the house or organization of the Lord become also a part of his kingdom or royal family. They are made pillars, so to speak, in the temple of God. The term “kingdom” is sometimes applied to Christ; as Jesus said to the unfaithful Jews, according to Matthew’s gospel, chapter twenty-one, verse forty-three: “Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” Therefore, Seripturally, “The Stone” mentioned by the Prophet Isaiah means God’s anointed King. Sometimes the Scriptures speak of Jesus Christ as the kingdom. For example, according to Luke’s gospel, chapter seventeen, verse twenty-one, Jesus said to the hypocritical Pharisees: “Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you”, or “among you”, as the marginal reading of the Bible says. In such an instance as this the kingdom means the Royal One Jesus. The Apostle Peter quotes the prophecy of Isaiah and definitely identifies Jesus Christ as the Head or chief corner stone. (1 Pet. 2:1-8) The Apostle Paul also quotes from the same prophecy and identifies Jesus as that chief Stone. (Rom. 9:32,33; Eph. 2:20, 22) “The Stone” therefore means God’s anointed King, and the laying of the corner stone means the presenting of him to God’s professed children as King to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The afore-quoted prophecy of Isaiah (28:16) is one that has a double fulfilment. The first or miniature fulfilment took place when Jesus was on earth; a com</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">plete </span><span class="font4">fulfilment, later, when he comes to his temple, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">spiritual house. The Israelites were God’s typical </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">prophetic people. Jesus was sent to them, and he preached to no one else while on earth. Jesus was anointed as King, and then began to preach concerning </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">kingdom. At that time, however, the Stone had not been laid. The Jews must first have an opportunity to accept him as their King and Jesus must first be tried, because the prophecy says that the Stone </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was “a </span><span class="font4">tried stone”. During the three and one-half years of his ministry Jesus was put to the severe test </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">trial, the enemy Satan seeking in every possible way to destroy him. (Matt. 4:1-10) Under the fiery trials He was proven true and faithful to God, and therefore “precious”. In due time Jesus rode into Jerusalem and offered himself to the Israelites as their King. That was the miniature fulfilment of the prophecy.—Matt. 21:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The official element of the Israelites, made up of the clergy, the politicians and the commercial powers, rejected Jesus as King and sought to turn all others against him. Shortly thereafter Jesus went to the temple and drove out the money-changers, and rebuked those who opposed the kingdom. (Matt. 21:13) The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">day </span><span class="font4">following, he pronounced the curse upon the fig </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tree </span><span class="font4">which he found to be full of leaves but bearing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">fruit, thereby prophetically declaring that the Jewish nation should no longer prosper but should come to an end. On the same day, while speaking to the ruling element of Israel, he quoted from the prophecy </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Psalm one hundred and eighteen, saying, “Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21:42,43) There he told them that he had offered himself to them as their King, that they had rejected him, and that their opportunity to be of the kingdom had come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Solomon gathered together material for the temple, or the house of the Lord, before he erected it, even so God by Christ Jesus, from Pentecost in A.D. thirty-three until his second coming, has gathered material for the spiritual house of the Lord. On the memorable day of Pentecost the faithful disciples of Jesus received the anointing of the holy spirit and were there made prospective members of the house of the Lord. They were there prepared as material for the house and laid aside until the due time for the erection of the temple, even as the Apostle Paul stated. (2 Tim. 4:6-8) The period of time from Pentecost until the second coming of the Lord has been used to prepare other living stones to be built up into the house of the Lord. Concerning this it is written: ‘Ye also are living stones built up into the spiritual house.’ (1 Pet. 2:3-5) All the anointed ones of the Lord who shall ever be a part of the royal family of heaven or the kingdom are therefore living stones, prepared like unto Christ Jesus to be placed in the house of the Lord in his due time. The placing thereof is done silently and without attracting the attention of the world, even as the material was placed in Solomon’s temple without sound of tools or confusion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>OVERC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font4">ILLINGNESS to endure all manner of reproach and ignominy as Jesus did when upon earth is one of the marks of the true follower </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Christ. Such willingness to suffer shame and re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">proach </span><span class="font4">in order that the message of Jehovah and his great government might go forward, the Scriptures show is one of the qualifications for associate member</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ship in </span><span class="font4">the kingdom of God.—Mark 10: 35-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of his zeal and loving devotion to the work which God had given Jesus to do he was reproached by the Devil and his instruments, particularly the clergy. In the face of all opposition he continued faithful until his zeal consumed him. (Ps. 69:8,9) Similar reproaches fall upon those who keep their </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">part in </span><span class="font4">the covenant by sacrifice and who are prospective heirs of the kingdom. (Rom. 15: 3) Today the clergy of the denominational systems and the principal ones of their flocks are popular in the world because they are a part of it, and these are the men that cast out of their company the earnest and zealous advocates of God, his Christ, and his kingdom. By their course of action you can identify those who are</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>OMERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">and those who are not real Christians. Jesus said: “Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.”—Luke 6: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reproaches are heaped upon those who love and advocate God’s kingdom of righteousness, and this is done generally by the religious element made up of the clergy and the principal ones of their flocks. The reason they do so is that they are of the world. Bear in mind that the world is Satan’s organization over which he is the god, and therefore his children and advocates have hated and persecuted Jesus. (John 8: 42-44) For the same reason the same class hates, reproaches and persecutes those who are faithful to the Lord. Jesus said to those who followed him faithfully, “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.”—John 15: 19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Suffering reproach for righteousness’ sake, that is to say, because one is advocating God’s kingdom of righteousness, is another means of identifying those who are prospective heirs of the kingdom. (Heb. 10: 33) God permits these reproaches for the purpose of testing and preparing his children and also as a proof to encourage them that they are his: “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.”—1 Pet. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4:</span><span class="font4"> 12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It pleased Jehovah to make his beloved Son perfect through suffering. He learned obedience by the things which he suffered. (Heb. 5: 8, 9) Those who will be his associates in the kingdom must be partakers of the same sufferings. (1 Pet. 2: 21) Paul, under inspiration, wrote to the Christians: “The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.”— Rom. 8: 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who will share with Christ in the rulership pf the world will necessarily be required to give orders or directions as to what shall be done. No creature could be capable of giving orders unless he first learns to obey orders that are given to him. This is one of the lessons that each true Christian must learn. It has been one of the hardest to learn. God does everything orderly. He gives his commandments and declares that those who keep them joyfully because they love him are pleasing to him and prove their love for him. (1 John 5: 3) The true follower of Jesus only desires to know what is God’s will and then he is eager to do it regardless of whom the Lord uses to give the orders or directions. He recognizes that he is in training for a place in God’s kingdom. Seeing then that Jesus learned obedience by the things which he suffered we may know that like discipline God will give to every one who becomes an associate with Jesus. (Heb. 12: 5, 6) Therefore suffering reproach for righteousness as Christ suffered is a condition precedent to being associated with Christ Jesus in his glorious reign. In this manner the Christian learns to be obedient, and for this reason the Christian is instructed: “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.” (2 Tim. 2: 12) There is a difference between being dead with Christ and suffering with him. By being taken into the covenant by sacrifice the Christian must die as a part of the sacrifice of Jesus in order to be given a part in the heavenly kingdom. He must suffer the reproaches that came upon Jesus, and like trials, in order that he may learn obedience to the end that he might be permitted to reign with Christ.—2 Tim. 2: 11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Understanding these divinely provided rules we can see why a real Christian has never been popular in the world. We can also see how Satan has organized a body of men into a system called “the Christian church”, who have called themselves by the name of Christ but who not only have been popular with the world but are part of the world. Satan has used the so-called “Christians” of his organization which is called “Christendom” to persecute the true Christians, even as foretold and foreshadowed in the persecution of Jacob by Esau. The clergy and the principal of their flock, by their hypocritical course of action, have also brought reproach upon the name of God and caused many men of honest hearts to turn away from God and from the Bible, and have made infidels of them. Let a man take a firm stand for the Lord and enthusiastically advocate his cause, and no matter how prominent he has previously been he becomes the object of reproach and persecution at the hands of the religionists. God could prevent such, of course, but he has permitted the Devil to pursue his own wicked course and has used the circumstances to perfect the true followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul was an example of this. He was a man of unusual attainments. He became a Christian and thereafterward suffered reproach, afflictions and loss that he might be approved and received into the kingdom of God. (Phil. 3: 8-14) His course and experience are the course and experience of every one who is true and faithful unto the Lord and who grows into the likeness of the Lord Jesus. A Christian is not discouraged by such experiences, because he remembers that it is written: “We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Rom. 8: 28) That means that those who have been called to be associates with Christ Jesus in God’s kingdom, and who really love the Lord and prove that love by an unqualified devotion to him, God orders their course and overrules all their experiences for their own good.—Prov. 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final qualification for association with Christ Jesus in his glorious reign is that the approved must be overcomers. To overcome means to conquer, prevail and get the victory. What, then, must the Christian overcome? The clergy have made men believe that they must overcome bad habits while they, the clergy, continue to practice bad habits. But this could not be what the Lord meant. Should a man overcome all of his weaknesses and become perfect in the flesh, that would not entitle him to a place in the kingdom. He must put forth his best endeavors to live a pure, upright and honest life. But he must do more than that. What, then, must the Christian overcome? He must overcome the world and its god. This means that the Christian must be absolutely and unswervingly devoted to Jehovah God. The world is the Devil’s organization, over which that evil one has long been the invisible ruler. (John 12:31; 14:30; 2 Cor. 4: 3, 4) The true Christian must resist the Devil and the seductive influence which he exercises through his organization and his emissaries. (1 Pet. 5: 8-10) The man who claims to be a Christian and who at the same time is a friend of the world or part of it is the enemy of God, because that man is allied with and supports the Devil and his organization. This plain statement is not made vindictively, but because it is the truth recorded in God's Word. God is training for, and will have in, his kingdom those and those only who are uncompromisingly on the Lord’s side. The clergy and the principal ones of their flocks claim to be Christians and at the same time manipulate, manage and control the politics of the world, which is of Satan’s organization. They constitute a visible part, of the governments of the world which they themselves claim are corrupt. In the Scriptures the relationship of a professed Christian who mixes up with the world and its politics is called &quot;adultery” because it is an illicit relationship of man with the Devil’s organization and God’s organization. For this reason God’s inspired witness wrote: &quot;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” —Jas. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not an easy matter to overcome the world. A man must take a firm stand for the Lord and refuse to be influenced to compromise the Lord’s Word and his cause with the world. The clergy have yielded to flattery and have therefore fallen easy victims to the god of this evil world. All who profess Christ are subject to a like temptation that was placed before Jesus. (Matt. 4: 1-8) To resist the Devil and the influence of his emissaries requires a course of vigilance and constant fighting. In so doing the Christian suffers much tribulation. Concerning this Jesus said to his followers: &quot;These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16: 33) The fact being that Jesus had to overcome the world, and did, it follows that all who will be associated with him must overcome the world. Only those who have faith and continue faithful unto God can overcome the world. &quot;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”—1 John 5: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the Christian, in order to be of the kingdom of God and be made a member of his righteous government, must gain the victory and overcome the world, is made clear by the words of Jesus, who said: &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Rev. 3:21) &quot;And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.” —Rev. 2: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Trials and tribulations beset the Christian from the beginning of his earthly course as a Christian and follow even unto the end thereof. Many fall under these trials and drop out. These trials and tribulations are essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14: 22) In such tribulation the victory must be gained over the evil one and his organization before the Christian can be made a pillar in the glorious temple of God. (1 John 2: 14,15; Rev. 3: 12) It was that great fight of faith which Paul fought, and won at the end of his earthly journey. He had been taken into the covenant for life, for a crown, and for the kingdom, and when he had finished his course he said to his beloved brother: “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” (2 Tim. 4: 6-8) And so must all fight the good fight of faith and gain the victory, being faithful unto the end. Such are the qualifications of those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus in the kingdom and share in the great reward. (Rev. 2: 10) All true Christians like Paul, who have fought the good fight, have been looking forward to that blessed and happy day when God through Christ would set up his kingdom. God foretold that when that blessed day should come his true people would know his name and would recognize his Word and understand it. He also foretold that these would be publishing the message of peace and good news concerning the kingdom. It necessarily follows that the last members to be called, and who would remain on the earth at the time for the setting up of the kingdom, would be represented by the &quot;feet” of Jesus. Looking down to that happy day God through his prophet said: &quot;Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak; behold, it is I. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.” (Isa. 52: 6-8) All faithful followers of Jesus must be fulfilling this prophecy when his government begins.</span></p>

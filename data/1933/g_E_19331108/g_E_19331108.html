<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Q-fie</span><span class="font12"> Golden Age</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N. Y., Wednesday, November 8, 1933 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 369</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Preparation” for Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.&quot;— 2 Kings 10:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford would not ask anybody to help him in the great work on which his mind and heart are set. He is not built that way; and we admire him for it. But we are sure that, as a true and faithful witness of Jehovah God, lie would be pleased with any method the Lord might use at this time to wake His people up to the seriousness of the situation that confronts them, and to the grand privileges which they have of climbing up into the chariot with Jehu, earth’s New King. And so, without any more preliminaries, to the work in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you believe in the things that Judge Rutherford sets forth? They are true. What are you going to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> about it? We stand on the threshold of Armageddon, foretold for six thousand years, at which time Jehovah God will resume full control of earth’s affairs, and at which time, if you are not heart and soul in sympathy with the New King, you will most certainly die. We want you to live; hence this statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not know the facts, but there must be many thousands of readers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font4">who do not take </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font4"> every one of them ought to have it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> merely seeks to present pen pictures of what is going on about us, as mirrored in the news of the day. Judge Rutherford’s books, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">all from his pen, are being used by the Lord to make clear His Word; all written expressly for the people now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not think </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> are too deep for you. Such is not the case. You </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">must have</span><span class="font4"> the food which these contain if you are to survive what is ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And further, you must </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> something with your life. You must show Jehovah God that you really love the truth, and that you really love Him, and love your spirit-begotten brethren now “prisoners”, church members in the Devil’s prison houses, and be willing to move to their relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What kind of person is it who knows that a building is on fire, and will burn to the ground, and that there are people in it who are blind, asleep, drugged, bound hand and foot, and yet fails or refuses to pull the fire alarm?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Won’t You Try to Find Out?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Won’t you try to find out what YOU can do to help honor God’s name? It would not cost you much. You could write a note or even a post card to Judge Rutherford, Brooklyn, N. Y., and ask him what you can do to help. It would be good to put on your envelope, “From a Jona-dab,’’ and we know that Judge Rutherford would be glad to help you find a place in the organization, even if it were nothing more than to proclaim THE GOLDEN AGE widely as“The Good News of the Kingdom of Jehovah God — the best all-round magazine in the world’’.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">1</a></sup> Write to him and see ivhat he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason why this subject is being put up to you in this manner is that time is now an important factor. The very fact that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> for Armageddon is off the press is proof enough that the time has come to prepare for the event itself; so, if your heart is right, this is meant as a helping hand to get into the Watch Tower organization and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> something.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>We Try to Describe “Preparation”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We try to describe Judge Rutherford’s latest book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font4"> and what follows are ideas snatched here and there from what is at the moment the most important book in the world. The book is so compact, so condensed, that it is difficult of description. It is an exposition of the prophecy of Zechariah. If we had once thought Revelation and Ezekiel the most difficult books of the Bible to understand, they now yield the palm to Zechariah; yet in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation </span><span class="font4">the whole book yields its treasures. And what treasures!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The kingdom of Jehovah God, which was born in 1914, is the main doctrine of the Scriptures; its interests have been given over to the faithful; it is the remedy for all human ills. Lifted up to power, it will destroy all that oppose its establishment. In Armageddon Jehovah himself will rain down upon His opposers pestilence, blood, overflowing rains, hailstones, fire and brimstone, making a full end of all the selfish and unrighteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God, the Great Shepherd of all the sheep, including the Jonadabs, is not responsible for mankind's woes and wickedness, but saves His people by becoming their God. It is this Mighty God, the God of Battle, the God of War, that, seeing Armageddon is necessary for the vindication of His name, and the cleansing of the earth, is maneuvering all the nations of the earth into open antagonism against Jerusalem, His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is this Mighty God that makes bright His clouds, sends forth His showers of truth and prepares those who love Him, including the Jonadabs, for the part they are to play in the preparation for Armageddon. He needs not to prepare himself for Armageddon, but He does need to prepare others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His eyes now see the overt acts that have been committed against those that are His, the remnant. He prepares the way for these to advance, and they do advance. He defends the remnant (and the Jonadabs), becomes a wall of fire about His people, and at Armageddon vindicates His witnesses and His word. He is himself the Commander in Chief of all the forces of righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gentlemen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I delayed writing this letter for some time through nothing other than carelessness. We have as many as twenty-five different magazines in our office. No other magazine creates as much faxorable comment as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> does. I can truthfully say that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> creates more favorable comments than all the other magazines combined. Am glad to give this recommendation for the benefit of anyone who might be skeptical about subscribing for it. I can assure you that they will be more than surprised with the pleasant comments which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font3">would create. Assuring you that it is my intention to subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> as long as it is published, I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours for greater success,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Yours truly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">M. W. Zimmermann. </span><span class="font4">sanctuary was cleansed, and before the Jonadab class began to appreciate their privilege of getting into God's organization), must needs all have laved in those cleansing waters before they could have been anointed. Truth is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">important. </span><span class="font4">‘The heavens giving their dew’ represents Jehovah God pouring out fresh truths for the anointed, the prisoners and the Jonadabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecy “I will hiss for them” refers to Jehovah’s ‘whistling’ to His people,drawing their attention, gathering them together as His flock, for the purpose of announcing His coming vengeance. The prophecy about ‘all families coming together at Jerusalem’ refers not to any assembly at any literal city, but does mean that at stated times all persons, regardless of physical location, shall assemble before Jehovah God, i.e., unto His organization, devoting themselves to the King and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s organization, the greater part of it invisible, is pictured in Zechariah’s prophecy by two brass mountains, by the four winds of heaven, and by the light-bearing candlestick. This organization, to which we hope, dear Jonadab, you will join yourself, becomes His instrument, implement and weapon for His purpose.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>“The Man That Is My Fellow”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“The man that is my fellow” is the one man, the Jew (Judean — praiser), upon whose skirts all that will be saved must take hold if they would live. He is The Branch, Christ Jesus, Joshua, the angel of Jehovah, the Governor in Judah. Like Melchisedec, He had no predecessor as king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This “man” was wounded, with those with Him, when the Elijah work was put to death, in 1918. Those were stirring times. In all the experiences of His people He shared with sympathetic heart. “I am Jesus whom thou perse-cutest.” He judges Joshua (the remnant in the flesh) and rebukes Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since then this “man”, who was called a bastard by the scribes and Pharisees, has been reigning in Ashdod, Satan’s stronghold. Many a time since 1918 the Devil’s crowd have wished that that “bastard” would keep silence. Nevertheless, He rules in the midst of His enemies, and none may say Him nay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This “man” is a burdensome stone, a “stone of stumbling”. You can see how it is. He is the cornerstone of Jehovah’s temple, or organization. Upon this stone eventually the eyes of all that live will rest when He shall have driven Satan’s organization into ruin and have vindicated His Father’s name in Armageddon. And thus it is that ‘seven eyes shall be upon that stone in that day’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This “man” is Jehovah’s “arrow”, that goeth forth as the lightning, Jehu-like. Or, He is the battle-bow that will cut off all other battle-bows. This man is the “nail” upon whom the Father will hang the glory of His house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The north half of the mountain cleft by Jehovah’s feet represents The Christ in kingdom power; the south half represents the angels of God’s organization. “Under the vine and fig tree” refers to present peace, security, rest and joy in the Lord. This, dear Jonadab, we hope you now possess.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Unobtrusive Angels</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The unobtrusive angels set a good example to us poor humans. They go quietly about the Father’s work, content to be unnoticed and unknown, but they have an important part to play in God’s organization and, very properly, have a grand share in the battle of Armageddon and the vindication of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The white horses (angels) are a division of the angels that attacks the forces of Satan’s prime minister, Gog. (In the evil world Satan, the mimic god, assumes the place of Jehovah, while Gog assumes the place of Jehovah’s vicegerent, Christ Jesus.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The black horses (angels) are a division of the angels that are entrusted with work that vindicates God’s name. The grizzled horses (angels) are a division of the angels that move on Satan’s earthly organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two interesting angelic personages arc represented as two women with stork wings. They are entrusted with the work of bearing the wicked old woman, the Devil’s wife, to the land of Shinar, Babylon. In other words, they fix her so that she cannot bring forth any more deviltry in the earth. The old lady gets her final ride in an ephah, a rather humiliating coffin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that an angel repeatedly talked with Zechariah shows that God uses angels to teach His people now on earth. In the prophetic picture the inhabitants of Jerusalem represent the remnant now in the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">You understand who “the remnant” are. They are the spirit-begotten that have been and are true and faithful to Jehovah God. They live for the honor of His name. In Zechariah's prophecy they are designated as the approved ones; the daughters of Zion; the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign; the apple of Jehovah's eye, the members of His organization, and as His little ones, or feeble ones. Jehovah’s turning of Ills hand upon the little ones was to lift them up, so that they might not Ite of those that lift up themselves. Jehovah's favor is marvelous in their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be well known to most of our readers that God's organization in the earth is now doing an Elisha work, very different from the Elijah work, which passed away in 1918. Those who were faithful in the Elijah work and are now also faithful in the Elisha work we identify in the book of Zechariah by Joshua. In </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font4"> Judge Rutherford's explanation of the books of Esther and Ruth, these are identified as the Mordecai and Naomi classes, i.e., they are the old-timers that keep up to date with the light of the truth and are faithful to that light. They </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other part of the remnant is obviously the class pictured by Esther and Ruth themselves in the books bearing those names. In the book of Zechariah they are the boys and girls playing in the streets, and the three men that came from Babylon with silver and gold for the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two parts of the remnant are really all one; all received the anointing alike. Collectively they are the bay horses of Zechariah’s vision. Collectively they are included in the four carpenters that hammer the horns off the Devil’s bullheads.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Recent History Reviewed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> reviews recent history. Prior to 1922 God was a little angry with His covenant people, because of their disobedience and negligence ; they were then a “curse” to the nations, but are now a blessing. Before those days there was no hire for man or beast, i.e., no effective service. During those days, while waiting for Jehovah to show His hand, the remnant passed through a great period of mourning. A similar mourning will overtake Satan's organization at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Strengthened by Jehovah’s invisible army, the remnant has been gathered out of Assyria, the political and religious elements of Satan’s organization. Its flight to the valley of Azal was from 1918 on. Delivered from Babylonian captivity, the remnant has been brought into the land of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fruitful in the old age of the church this company now gathered to Zion returned to build the temple of God, were gathered unto the temple as Christ's joint-heirs, were given a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, and thus anointed were sent forth to bear witness to Christ's crowning. Beyond the veil the resurrected members of this royal house, the House of David, are as powerful as the Angel of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Collectively this entire company has turned to the stronghold; it is now in the valley of the mountains; now drinking the new wine of the kingdom. The removal of Joshua’s filthy garments represents the approval of this remnant for service, but they must give the strictest heed to the Word or go back into captivity to Satan's organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Remnant Must Obey the Word</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The truths now being brought out in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> and Judge Rutherford's other books, and in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> give hope to the remnant, but they must obey the Greater Moses now setting before them life and death. They must do the things commanded, must declare the judgments written and must strengthen the weak hands, and all must share in the general service of the hour without distinctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The remnant will avoid spies, hypocrites, opposers and false shepherds, and the Jonadabs will do the same. What the remnant accomplishes is accomplished only by God’s spirit. Though despised by the enemy, this little company walks to and fro through the earth, walking up and down in Jehovah’s name, scattering His fiery message right and left. They are fighters of the right sort, submitting to no censorship of their heaven-sent message, and in the end will trample under foot all opposition. “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jerusalem (Judah — praiser), the remnant, is the “third part” that goes through the “fire&quot;, the refiner's fire of purification. Their part is to sing Jehovah’s praises. Against them will come the great stress of the siege in the Battle of the Great Day, but through it all the remnant with steady hand will continue to warn men of the Lord's cup that makes the nations reel. In another figure, the Lord shall smite the waves in the sea and all their waters shall be dried up, that the advance of the remnant may not be blocked. In fact, they shall see the lifeblood of their enemies spilled in Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Known since 1931 as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font4"> the remnant are pictured in Zechariah’s prophecy as the skirt of the Jew upon whom the ten men take hold. They are also pictured as the two olive trees. The tents of Judah (praise) are their temporary dwelling places, i.e., they dwell temporarily on earth in the flesh. They stand in contrast to the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Scattered in various parts of the earth, there to perform God's will, the remnant there shine forth as the sun. They understand Zechariah’s prophecy, have broken all connection with “Christendom”, are criticized for declaring God’s vengeance, but ask not permission to preach the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having been caused to possess all the precious truths now due, the remnant must remain cleansed, must serve notice, must show the way of escape, and have part in executing the judgments written. They shall increase as they have increased; Satan cannot succeed against them; they shall be counted in with and as a part of the Vindicator of God's name. Jehovah’s organization as a whole does not magnify itself against the remnant; none can magnify himself above another; all the glory is for Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Poor Prisoners in Babylon</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The poor “prisoners” in Babylon, the “great multitude”, are in a pit wherein is no water; nevertheless, though they are now in the pit, and like desolate heritages, yet they are part of the flock that is to be fed and are called to return to God’s organization. These poor unfortunates will understand Zechariah’s prophecy, will flee to the valley of the mountains, the path of truth, and will be joined to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jonadab class receive the life-giving waters before Armageddon and the rest of mankind, symbolized by the “great sea”, afterwards. Half the living waters go to the former, and half to the hinder sea. Pictured as ten men of all languages the Jonadabs hear the truth, understand it, and say, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I will go also. </span><span class="font4">These are part of the flock to be fed; they are warned and shown the way of escape; they understand Zechariah’s prophecy and flee to the valley of the mountains. The Jonadab class will pass through Armageddon and will witness the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ‘gates of the city’ are not literal gates, but references to entry into Jehovah's organization; the tower of Hananeel is God’s watch tower; the king’s winepresses are a reference to the joy of the Lord. The staff Beauty pictures the everlasting covenant made with all people; the candlestick pictures Jehovah’s organization and witness work for all devoted to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The up-to-the-minuteness of the book may be judged from the applications of various scriptures to every year from 1914 to 1933 inclusive, with but four omissions from the list. One of the most important periods in the history of the kingdom of God terminated October 15, 1932 — the 2,300 days of Daniel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Satan and His Invisible Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the battle of Armageddon Lucifer, now Satan, the prince (god) of this world, will take his last stand as the mimic god. He it is who challenged Jehovah’s word in Eden and has defamed His name till now; he it is who formed all fraudulent religions, created the oppressive commercial system and corrupted and uses the political element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan has formed a conspiracy against God’s anointed, seeking to prevent further testimony work. The conspiracy is marshaled under the leadership of Gog, the same evil angel who formed the conspiracy to kill Jesus. One of Satan’s mouthpieces, and his field marshal, this enemy of Jehovah God is to be crushed and destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Satan’s Visible Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The principal part of Satan’s visible organization is the seventh world power, the “little horn” of Daniel, the Anglo-American alliance. Typified by Greece and her sons, this power, in an implied covenant with God, has been the principal persecutor of His people. In one place Zechariah refers to it as an impenetrable forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1918 the seventh world power rifled the houses of Bibles and Bible helps and ravished the women, i.e., tried to force the chaste virgins of Christ to abandon their loyalty and yield to their wishes. The Elijah work was not heeded by “Christendom”, but was killed in that year. The remnant mourned for it after it was pierced, but those that went over from it into the Elisha work found their privileges doubled. The Mordecai class was the first to take up the new work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The seventh world power, “the false prophet,” ‘‘Christendom’s” mainstay, is a colossal fraud and a shedder of blood; it is the ‘&quot;cedar” tree, the Devil’s substitute for Jehovah's kingdom; it has rejected Christ as King and His kingdom and has broken the everlasting covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord was but a little displeased with His people, but this wicked system took away the continual sacrifice and cast down the sanctuary. Like Hamath, it borders on Tyre (the commercial element) and Zidon (the propaganda system) in its attacks upon the remnant. Tyre, the commercial element on land and sea shall be devoured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The breaking of the staff Bands, God’s covenant with “organized Christianity”, was on July 26, 1931, with the adoption of the resolution at Columbus. Babylon symbolized Satan's organization. Jerusalem, Zion, God’s organization, is to govern; the abomination, the League of Nations, is to be destroyed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The “Man of Sin”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” at the last includes the clergy and the elective elders, and aids public officials in the persecution of Jehovah's witnesses. This ‘foolish shepherd’ class, the “evil servant” class, the would-be “nail” upon which the glory of the kingdom should hang, like Judas, prices Jehovah’s witnesses (at what a price!), sells the flock and blesses God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three shepherds that are cut off in one month (suddenly) are the “man of sin”, the clergy, and the elective elders; these are the goats that are punished. The two parts that are cut off and die are the clergy and the “evil servant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy, the false swearers and thieves, have been purchased by the commercial and political elements; they indulge in formalism, which is displeasing to Jehovah; those that follow them are not fed; they are Satan’s instruments to scatter the sheep; they sell the flock and wear special garments for effect. They will get their wounds in the house of their friends when the ‘‘prisoners&quot;, the “great multitude&quot;, pull down the house from beneath them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those sheep merchants are part of the rulers of “Christendom”. As the mighty oaks of Ba-sh.an they are Big Business’ camouflage religions. As Philistines, they are opposers of God and His row.-’aiit and are to be vanquished. A ‘father and mother thrusting through a false prophet' means that the faithful use the Word of God unsparingly, no matter how near the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “evil servant” class cannot serve, because its arm is dried; and it cannot see, because its right eye is darkened. When the city, God's organization in the earth, was taken captive in 1918, the “evil servant” went into captivity, but the residue, the remnant, was not cut off from the city, but is in it to this day, thank God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The elective elders gnash their teeth and weep and wail because the truth exposes their unfaithfulness. They have been occupying an un-scriptural position, putting service work in the rear, and copying the clergy as to garments. Pictured by the Samaritans, these false shepherds are like diviners; they are not permitted in the temple, not used by Jehovah to feed His people, and yet attempt to prophesy. Having been cut off as shepherds, they must be got rid of. They come into one class with the clergy, the “man of sin”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The Battle of Armageddon</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">From the spring of 1918 to Armageddon is the day of “Preparation” of the forces that will participate in the “battle of the great day of God Almighty”, earth’s final and conclusive conflict. That battle is the attack by Satan’s forces on the New Jerusalem. “Christendom” will bring all its power and wealth to bear against Jehovah’s organization. At Armageddon every one that is on Jehovah’s side will be wholly devoted to Him. The conversion of the world will follow thereafter, easily and naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the fore part of the battle, or preceding it, we might say, Gog, Satan’s prime minister; the entire beast, “Christendom’s” political, commercial and religious monster; and the seventh world power, the “false prophet”, will boast and babble in an unprecedented manner. The visible part, pictured by Egypt and by trees, will fall in sections and every element thereof be destroyed. The strong-arm squad has already joined Gog against God’s people, and due notice has been served on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan, cast out of heaven, has drawn “Christendom’’ into his camp, taken a position like Jehovah, directing Gog, and will see his organization perish. The concluding act is the destruction of Satan himself. The flying roll, a great record. 15 by 30 feet, contains the message of God's vengeance against covenant-breakers, of whom Satan has been one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Armageddon Jehovah’s four-square organization will come against all parts of Satan’s organization, which shall crumble like a rotten wall; how soon this will be no man knows. Just one of the plagues of the enemies of Jehovah is that “their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume in their mouth”. The promised plague of the horse, mule, camel and ass will mean the end of tanks, airplanes, motor trucks and like instruments. In the midst of all that will be required of the remnant in that day come the words, “Fear not, but let your hands be strong.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Concluding Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The thousand-year reign of Christ is a day by itself, beginning, not with the beginning of the reign of Christ, but with the vindication of God’s name at Armageddon. The ‘mourning as one mourneth for his only son’ is the mourning for the Elijah work that passed away in 1918, never to be revived; it should stop. Instead of fasting and sorrowing because the truth progresses, joy should be in every heart, “forgetting the things that are behind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Courageously, Judge Rutherford in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> points to a changed view on one text from that given in a certain place in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font4"> To more than offset it is the discovery that Deuteronomy is written for our time. We conclude with a single paragraph from this wonderful book, which should be digested by every person in the world who loves Jehovah God and is hoping to pass through Armageddon into peace:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophecy of Zechariah clearly discloses those truths, which, in brief, may be stated in this manner, to wit: After Satan and his wicked angels are cast out of heaven, and after the World War has ended, Christ Jesus and his accompanying hosts of angels make inspection, or survey, of all the things pertaining to the earth. The Lord beholds and makes note of the wicked condition of hypocritical “Christendom”. Christ then gathers together before him for judgment all who have made, either directly or in an implied manner, a covenant with Jehovah to do his will and all who have been called to the Kingdom, and begins the work of judging; and all the approved ones ho brings into the temple and makes a part of Jehovah's organization. Thus the approved ones are made a part of Zion and are truly “Judeans”. In the judgment work that takes place at the temple Christ Jesus gathers out or puts away all of “Christendom”, and particularly her clergy that have proved unfaithful to God. He gathers out and puts away all lawless workers, the selfish and ambitious ones that form the “evil servant” class; the slothful and improvident or worthless servant is taken away, and everything about the sanctuary is cleared out and cleansed, leaving only those who truly love God and who are entirely and wholly devoted to him end his kingdom. Thus God's sanctuary is cleansed. The approved ones lie sends forth then to “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”, and their offering is “pleasant unto the Lord” because they are devoted to him and his praise and service. (Mal. 3: 3,4) All of such is a work of preparation before and for the great war, and at which “battle of that great day of God Almighty” the name and word of Jehovah will be for ever vindicated before all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Radio Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TJULASKI, Va. “I have just enjoyed listening to the splendid and very searching lecture delivered by Rutherford at ten o’clock this morning. Because of my keen interest in and deep concern relative to his wonderful books and scholarly speeches, I am asking that you send to me at your earliest convenience a copy of the lecture this morning.” G. W.L. (Principal) Buffalo, N. A’. “Kindly send me one of Judge Rutherford’s addresses. Am more than interested in your helpful broadcasts.” K. L. II. Orange, N. J. “Today I had the pleasure of listening for the first time to Judge Rutherford. His talk from the shoulder (if you will pardon the expression) impressed me more than words can say, and so if you can spare a copy of this morning’s lecture, or any other, for that matter, I will say thank you.” S. E. K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Providence, R. I. “Having listened to that wonderful lecture, given so fearlessly by Judge Rutherford this beautiful morning, I was very much touched, and would like to receive last Sunday's lecture, that I may study same and check up same, as I am a believer in God, but not of any particular faith except when I hear the Word of God preached faithfully by a man as if it was in his own heart and mind. I hope the time will never come when we cannot hear the truth plainly spoken and cannot receive these great messages over the radio.” H. A. M. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Haddonfield, K. J. “Please send me copy of Judge Rutherford's lecture. It was fine. I listen to the Watchtower every Sunday. May the Lord bless Judge Rutherford and keep him from all harm. 1 have read quite a few of hi&lt; books and think they are just grand.” Mrs. E. AV. AV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Making the Final Choice</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font4">ROM Judge Rutherford's address “Why Serve Jehovah”, broadcast October 15,1933, on a chain of over one hundred stations, extending from coast to coast, one gathers the clear impression that there are now millions of people in America that are making their final choice as to whether they will continue to worship the false god, the mimic god, the god of this world, the one that has held the whole human family in bondage for six thousand years, or will turn to the true and only God, Jehovah, the Creator and Redeemer of man, the everlasting Ruler of the universe. Destiny is at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is general unanimity among the thinkers that there is something radically wrong with the world. They can see the trail of blood and crime stretching across the centuries; they know that the masses have toiled and produced and had nothing, and that the classes have neither toiled nor produced but have had more than heart could wish. In themselves they feel the urge for justice, but some of them sadly admit that they know not how to bring it about. A few, a very few, of these thinkers reason from effect back to cause and justly conclude that man is not functioning as he was designed to function and that some evil force is restraining or impeding him in the proper exercise of his faculties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such reasoning is correct and locates the Devil, Satan, as the real cause of humanity’s woes. Without knowing that they are so doing, most men by their course of conduct bear silent testimony to the fact that they are serving and therefore worshiping the Devil. They do his will, or, as the Scriptures put it, they are taken captive by him at his will. His servants ye are to whom ye render obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No man of himself is clever enough to match his wits with Lucifer, Satan, the archenemy of Jehovah God, who has had six thousand years of experience in testing out various methods of dishonoring God’s name and of deceiving and oppressing mankind. For now many centuries he has seemingly had his best results by heralding the correlative evils of purgatory and eternal torture as the fate reserved for man by a god that has neither wisdom, justice nor love.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Devil Is a Liar</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Over and over again, in one form or another, Judge Rutherford proves to his audiences that the Devil is a liar. He tells them where and how in Eden the first lie and the first liar started man upon his present unhappy course; how it was that the first man lost life and the right thereto, and the challenge was made and accepted that Jehovah could not put a man upon the earth who would under the stress of suffering remain true to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At length the man Christ Jesus appeared, and, though He suffered, His obedience never flagged; He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. He was faithful even unto death, and because of His faithful devotion and service to Jehovah He proved His own qualifications to be the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and the Savior of the human race. In due time He was rewarded with a name which is above every name, Jehovah’s alone excepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus bestowed upon His apostles a share in bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name, with the certainty that the reproaches which had fallen upon Him would fall upon them. What they endured, that they might have the privilege of maintaining their integrity toward Jehovah God, occupies a considerable space in the New Testament record. They laid down their burdens at the close of life’s little day secure in the assurance of their acceptability as true and faithful witnesses and of a place with Jesus wherever He shall be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the apostles other faithful ones were taken out from among men to be the followers of Christ Jesus, until, in 1914, the World War and other attending evidence furnished the proof that the time had come for Christ’s reign to begin, and it did begin, one of its first acts, properly, being the expulsion from heaven of the Dragon, the Devil, who till that time had had access to the heavenly courts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Fight Transferred to Earth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since the expulsion of Satan from heaven the fight between the new King, Christ Jesus, and the old king, Satan, has been transferred to earth, and Jehovah now has in the earth witnesses who go from one stronghold of Satan to another to bear testimony that Satan’s reign has ended and Christ’s reign has begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This creates an interesting situation. These witnesses, to be faithful, must be scorned, abused, arrested and maltreated; and they have been, and they are thus treated, and this accounts for the strange treatment they have received in the earth, many times recorded in these columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all past ages, from Abel even until now,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">there have been some that were faithful and true to Jehovah God. The Scriptures mention many of these who lived be tore the days of Jesus. The Scriptures show that these faithful ones that in that long interval of about four thousand years remained true and steadfast, maintaining their integrity, v. ill be resurrected as perfect men and made the visible representatives of God’s righteous government on earth. The awakening of these cannot now be faraway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just now a new class is coming to the fore, a class plainly foreshown in Holy Writ, a class that joins itself to earth’s new King, participates in the witness work, or, at any rate, observes it with friendly eye, passes unscathed through the battle of the great day of God Almighty (Armageddon), receives the Lord’s word of approval and the promise of everlasting life and goes over into the golden age of glory and peace and joy and divine blessing everywhere told in Holy Writ, and that every decent and honest person on earth wants to see in full operation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>The Jonadabs of Jehovah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Happy are the Jonadabs of Jehovah, in some respects the most fortunate people that have ever lived. Like the faithful from Abel to the very time of the cleansing of the sanctuary (now a year in the past), they must have the spirit of full and true obedience to Jehovah God, and a sincere and honest desire to see the vindication of that name though the earth stagger like a drunken man and the storms that sweep across the visible heavens seem to rend it in twain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet no matter how great the storm, these faithful ones will live on, and shall see their little ones grow up in a world where plenty shall take the place of poverty, peace shall take the place of war, truth shall take the place of falsehood, honor shall take the place of dishonor, justice shall take the place of injustice, the Lord Jesus Christ will take the place of Satan, the god of this world, and, most important of all, the good name of Jehovah God will be vindicated and He shall take His rightful place in the heart of every one that lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meantime the Jonadabs are in for a warm time, no doubt; but what of that? They have had troubles in the past which brought them nothing; now their faithful conduct will bring them everything. As the sheep, in the parable of the sheep and goats, they will seem unlovely to the goats. But the important thing is that they are approved by earth's new King (the antitypical Jehu); He lifts them up into His organization, as Jonadab was lifted up into Jehu’s chariot, and they are in for the grandest ride in history. When it is over the Devil and his crowd, including the goats, will be out of luck. They have had six thousand years of it; now they are not going to have any more at all. Jonadab will tell about that ride for a thousand years, at the very least.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The World Will Be Coming Along</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The world will be coming along behind the Jonadabs. Don’t worry about their salvation; the great God has made all necessary provision for that. As fast as divine wisdom sees will be best they will be awakened from the sleep of death (not brought back from heaven, hell, purgatory, limbo or any other place where the Devil’s clergy’ have put them) and be given a chance to line up and live or line up and die. The lining up work is on right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the Devil out of the way, and the priests and preachers all silent in the grave, and all lying newspapers closed up, Big Business at an end, the strong-arm squad a mere matter of history, and the Devil’s governments no longer functioning, it v\ ill not take the new King long to open the blind eyes of all that wish to see, and to open the deaf ears of all that wish to hear. Those that prefer to remain blind and deaf will be allowed to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is an hour filled with tragic importance when Judge Rutherford hints to his great audience that the Devil’s crowd are seeking now, in their desperation, to prevent him from broadcasting the truth to the people, as he has been doing now for years past. They may succeed, temporarily, but final victory will be with Jehovah God and with those who are faithful to Him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Latin America — The Question Mark of the 20th Century </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Four Parts —</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">II</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">T THE height of the French Revolution, just after the death of Robespierre, a dashing young widow, with her two children, called upon Napoleon Bonaparte, to thank him for restoring to her the sword of her executed husband. She became the Empress Josephine. She was born in the French West Indies, in the island of Martinique. It has belonged to France since 1635.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though small in size, Martinique has created considerable excitement in the world. In 1929, from its 385 square miles, it exported 34,972 tons of sugar and 4,369,057 gallons of rum. In 1927 it was calculated that 97 percent of the 234,695 inhabitants are Negroes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On May 8, 1902, Mont I’elee, in the northwestern part of the island, erupted, completely destroying the town of Saint Pierre, with all of its 26,000 inhabitants. One iron vessel, with her decks loaded to the gunwales with hot ashes, staggered to sea and was the only thing within reach that escaped. Four months later a second eruption destroyed about 2,500 more persons in adjoining villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Guadeloupe, another of the French West Indies, some seventy-five miles to the north of Martinique, has about the same population, but is almost double the size. A hurricane in 1928 took 660 lives. Porto Rico we described at length in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> No. 230.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first land that Columbus saw in the new world was Guanahani, or Cat island, one of the Bahamas. His first landing was on San Salvador, or Watling island, also one of the Bahamas. The Bahamas were fully described in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> No. 253.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On his first voyage, on which he discovered Cuba, he also discovered and left a garrison of 39 men on what is now called the island of Santo Domingo or Haiti, but was then called Espanola or Hispaniola. This island, which is now divided politically between the black republics of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, is 400 miles long and nearly 200 miles wide. Mount Tina, the highest mountain peak, is 10,300 feet high.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Toussaint L’Ouverture</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Santo Domingo is famous as the birthplace of the Haitian soldier and liberator, Toussaint L’Ouverture. He was a full-blooded Negro and was born a slave. This man, considered one of the ablest military men of his time, was responsible for the successive chasing of British, French and Spanish troops out of the island, and the establishing of the two Negro republics that now occupy it. Treacherously seized, he died a prisoner in France; but, though both republics are dominated by the United States Government, they still persist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total population of both parts of the island of Santo Domingo is 3,750,000, almost solidly Negro. Demonism is rampant. It was the French Revolution that stirred these blacks to exterminate their white rulers, and when Haiti showed her ability to shake off the yoke, the fires of liberty were set all over South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had the blacks that were brought over from Africa really been ‘•Christianized”, Spain would perhaps be in control of all Latin America to this day; but the clergy were corrupt and vicious, selfish and untrustworthy. In their treatment of their slaves the white women were said to he more cruel than even the men. Among the women of the colony were many of low morals, taken from the streets of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Negroes came to see the whites just as they were, and determined to get rid of them, and did. The two races fought with the ferocity of wild beasts, committing frightful atrocities on both sides. The sweeping victory obtained has made it difficult to handle or control the Negroes now living on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first gold that Columbus took to his sovereigns came from Santo Domingo. That it was hardly won is proved by the fact that, even with modern methods, the mines which produced this gold cannot be profitably worked today. The only way they could be worked at a profit was by the forced labor of Indian and Negro slaves, which was the way it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On September 3, 1930, a hurricane swept the city of Santo Domingo, destroying all but four hundred of the ten thousand buildings in the city. By this terrible storm 2,500 were slain, 10,000 were injured and 30,000 were rendered shelterless. The property loss exceeded $20,-000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Dominican Republic, which occupies the eastern two-thirds of the island, has an area of 19,325 square miles. It is thus considerably larger than Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, put together. It is very fertile, about 15,500 square miles being cultivable. Exports in 1927 were $31,178,769. Now you know why the United States’ marines have stayed there so long. That military administration, however, has built 845 miles of modern highways, besides railways, and increased the enrollment of school children from 18,000 to more than 100,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Haiti, which occupies the western one-third of the island, has an area of 10,204 square miles and thus exceeds the area of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Here also the United States military administration has built 800 miles of modern highways. Exports in 1927 were $22,667,246.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">United States troops were withdrawn from the Dominican Republic in 1924, and are expected to be withdrawn from Haiti in 1936.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Pearl of the Antilles</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Fifty miles west of the island of Santo Domingo or Haiti lies the island of Cuba, 730 miles long, with an average width of 50 miles. The eastern end lies directly south of New York city, the western end directly south of Fort Wayne, Indiana. The total area is about that of Pennsylvania. A splendid day and night service of through express trains, equipped with sleeping cars and dining cars, covers the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conditions in Cuba are very different from those in Haiti. Of a total population of 3,763,375, about 70 percent are white, a condition almost exactly comparable to Florida, to which it lies so near. Favored with a wonderful climate, and the most productive soil anywhere known, Cuba produces regularly one-half of the world’s sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mountains of Cuba are covered with magnificent forests. The scenery is wiki and very beautiful. A concrete motor road 20 feet 8 inches wide runs for 705 miles, the length of the island, without any grade crossings. The cost was approximately $101,125,000, which figures out at $143,439 per mile. Somebody must have squandered money on that road like a drunken sailor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is believed that for climate, soil, and location with reference to markets, as well as number of excellent ports, Cuba is one of the most favored spots, perhaps the most so, on the globe. Extremes of temperature are unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many beautiful caverns in Cuba, and in the western provinces numerous streams disappear from view in underground channels long before the sea is reached. There are vast iron-ore deposits, near Santiago. The copper mines at Cobre, also near Santiago, were at one time the greatest copper mines in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than 3,350 native plants have been catalogued. All kinds of tropical fruits grow luxuriantly, many of them without cultivation: bananas, coconuts, oranges, lemons, limes, pineapples, anons, mango rose-apples, pomegranates, sapotes, tamarinds, figs, citrons, guavas, alligator pears, mameys and guanabanas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the cigar factories with which Havana abounds, readers are employed who read good books aloud to the workers as they work. Thus the Cubans are among the best read people to be found. The University of Havana, until it was closed in 1931 by presidential decree, had over 6,000 students.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Beautiful Land of Anahuac</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The thieves and murderers of Europe were always fond of the fields and mines and personal property of the denizens of other lands; and they remain so to this day. When Pope Alexander VI drew his famous line through the Azores, from pole to pole, giving everything west of that line to the Spanish monarch, he probably never once thought of the command, ‘'Thou shalt not steal”; and when Cortez invaded Mexico and covered the land with blood it is doubtful whether he knew there is such a mandate from the Almighty as “Thou shalt not kill”. Mexico traces her present-day trouble to these errors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Mexico of today is 1,900 miles long, with a breadth varying from 750 to 130 miles. It is a plateau country; and the combination of a tropic sun, a high elevation and a rich soil enables it to produce 90 percent of all the different agricultural products known to man, at the same time giving to a larger part of the interior the climate of eternal spring, 65° to 75° the year around. The rainfall is liberal: and the streams from the tablelands to the sea have cut wonderful canyons, 800 to 1,000 feet deep, creating a beauty and variety of scenery of remarkable interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this beautiful land of Anahuac, as it was then called, the Aztecs of long ago developed a form of civilization blemished, it is true, but probably not worse than that which Cortez represented; and in some respects it may have been better. At any rate it was a “self-determination of peoples”, and the people then were happier than they have been since.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>The Aztec and His Ejido</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejido</span><span class="font4"> is the key to the Mexican question. The Aztec government was a tribal one, and so devised that absolute poverty was an impossibility. Around every village was a great tract of land owned by the village as a whole. Every year the natives, by their elders in the town council, parceled out the land that was to be worked by each family. Such a thing as private property in land was never known among the Aztecs. None among them could become wealthy at the expense of the others, and none among them could become destitute if willing to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ill and the aged were cared for, rights of person and property were enforced, marriage was sacred, and intemperance was frowned upon. There were courts of appeal; and even the Aztec emperor himself was held in check by a supreme court that protected the humblest subject against any attempted aggression. Great post-roads girdled the entire country. Upon these roads trained runners relayed messages to and from the remotest parts of the empire in an incredibly short time. Intensive farming, canals and irrigation ditches made Mexico a Hower garden. The mines yielded almost illimitable treasures. The wealth of the Aztec nation know no bounds. Gold, silver and precious stones were more plentiful with them than with any other nation of the ancient or modern world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Cortez a Fiend Incarnate</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Upon this scene of peace and plenty the European savage Cortez landed in April, 1519, with 11 vessels, 700 Spaniards, 18 horses and 10 pieces of artillery. For hundreds of years the Mexicans had had the superstition that at some time white “gods” (!) would come from the East and dispossess them of their country. The landing of Cortez filled the people with terror; for they esteemed him and his followers to be immortal gods whom it would be useless to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Montezuma, the Aztec emperor, sent embassies to Cortez while he was still at Vera Cruz, attempting to dissuade him from invading the country. These embassies carried with them helmets full of gold dust, beautifully engraved gold and silver plate, and collars and bracelets of gold and silver, inlaid with precious stones. The more Cortez and his followers saw of these gifts the more rapacious they became; and Cortez himself, a man of intrepid courage and unspeakable devilishness, forced the issue by burning his ships and sending one of Montezuma's embassies back with both hands of every one of the fifty men cut off at his wrists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By November 18 of the same year Cortez had reached Mexico city, then called Tenochtitlan; and although received with the greatest courtesy by the people he imprisoned their emperor, obliterated all records of the Aztec civilization, burned their great library, razed their monuments, killed their most intelligent representatives and left not a vestige of their original city when he began the rebuilding of the city in 1522.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to a Tezeocan account, when Montezuma found he could not avoid the initial interview with Cortez he said to him and to his men: “Be welcome! Rest now after the labor you have had in coming such long ways. This is your house and these are your palaces—take them and rest therein with your captains and the companions who have come with you.” Compare the acts of this heathen man with those of the supposed Christian, Cortez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the acts of Cortez which mark the character of the man were the burning alive of an Aztec governor and sixty of his followers and the butchery of six hundred of the nobility in their temple, after he had given them permission to assemble there for religious services, and had stipulated that they must come unarmed. In the city of Cholula, while the streets of the city were thronged with people attending a festival, he became suspicious; and at a given signal his men opened fire and killed thousands of them. By these and similar methods of cruelty and terrorism he seized Mexico in the name of the Spanish sovereign. It is estimated that he and his brothers in arms in North America and South America put to death fifteen million innocent persons within the first half century after the discovery of America; but there were sections of Mexico, notably Yaqui land, that he did not conquer and that have never been subjugated even to this day.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Pauperizing a Nation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">But bad as were the things that Cortez did to the generation then living, the thing that he did to the unborn generations of Mexicans for hundreds of years to come was worse. He took away from the people their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos,</span><span class="font4"> located obviously in the centers of the richest areas, and gave these lands to the Spaniards who came with him and who followed him. The natives were driven away from the fertile and well watered valleys to hilly, wooded or semiarid lands, there to struggle for a livelihood under much less favorable conditions, although millions of them were denied even that privilege, and were branded with hot irons and made slaves of the colonists who now began to come from Spain in large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unfamiliar with the (to the Aztec) vicious and unexplainable system of private ownership of land, the Mexicans lost more and more of their lands, some to the nobility, the great landlords, and some to the church, until today the descendant of the Aztec is virtually landless and homeless in the land of his fathers. Not all of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> were lost at once; indeed, some of them are in existence to this day, and there are places in Mexico even now where the live stock of any villager may be pastured free of charge on the outskirts of the village, in a space allotted. But transfer of title away from the people who properly owned these areas into the hands of great and wealthy landholders has progressed from the time of Cortez onward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The original idea of most of the so-called colonizing countries of Europe was to use the new countries merely as sources of raw material, and to do everything possible to repress their industries, the same as is still done in our generation with the cotton industries of India and Egypt; and until 1821 Mexico was so completely in subjection to Spain that no person born outside of Spain, even if of Spanish parents, could hold office of any kind in Mexico. Some of these Spanish viceroys were good men ; many of them were bad men. Most of them were cruel and selfish, and not interested in Aztecs except as slaves. In many of them the capacity to think and act independently and effectively was stunted by the law of the Inquisition, “Thou slialt not think”; and force and cunning inevitably superseded true statesmanship.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Roman Catholicism in All Its “Glory”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The most conspicuous example of what private ownership of lands leads to in a country where the common people are ignorant of such a custom is that of General Luis Terrazas. At one time this man, recently living in El Paso, held 70,000,000 acres in the state of Chihuahua —one-half of the state. He could ride all day north, south, east or west and never go outside of his own land. The whole city of Chihuahua belonged to him. No one in the city could borrow money or buy property without his consent; and if any borrowed they paid, toward the last, 12 percent for the use of their money, all of which went into his coffers. He paid no taxes to anybody, had 30,000 natives in his immediate service, worked them to the limit, paid them thirty or forty cents a day, compelled them to trade at his stores, and virtually held them as slaves. He was supposed to be the largest landowner in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1910, some eleven thousand families owned 44 percent of the national territory, including the bulk of the best arable soil. These estates were almost entirely free of taxation, the bulk of the taxes being laid against the smaller holdings. Many of the great landlords held thousands of acres idle right at the time when thousands of the common people were wandering, landless and homeless, from one mine or plantation to another, seeking a chance to earn bread. This land question in Mexico is really at the bottom of all Mexican troubles, and is one that will not down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So many of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> had fallen into the hands of a few aristocrats, and so many more had come under the control of the church, that when in 1857 the constitution was changed and the lands of the church were confiscated, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> were confiscated with them, the thought apparently being to restore all their lands to the people, but by a system of private ownership instead of community ownership. The actual effect of the law was to malic the condition of the people still worse than it had been; for the confiscated lands passed very quickly from religious to secular control, the great landlords bought them up for a song, and the people in general were brought to a condition which amounted to slavery, as on the Terrazas estates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The natives have never ceased to want their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> back. From generation to generation they talk about them; and Carranza did actually bring about the restoration of 117 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos,</span><span class="font4"> covering 280,244 acres. Ten acres of this rich soil, bearing three crops a year, is sufficient to maintain a family of five persons, so that it may be said that Carranza succeeded in repatriating 140,000 humans on the soil which belonged to them and to their families. And who shall say that this was not a commendable work? How many other statesmen do we know that have succeeded in restoring 140,000 of the poor to their lost lands and lost liberties? Persons in Mexico at the time that some of these </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos </span><span class="font4">were returned to the people state that good soldiers to whom some of these </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> belong in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">80 communal ownership suddenly threw away ilicir guns and became the most pacific of farmers, not even waiting to finish the tasks in hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Enslaving Future Generations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Whichever way we turn in consideration of Mexico's difficulties, we are confronted anew with the problems arising out of the possession of almost all of her soil by a few families. So great were these estates a. few years ago that the average size of the Mexican hacienda was eighty times as great as that of Cuba, and four thousand times as great as in Porto Pico. Three of these vast estates, taken together, were as large as the whole of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The owners of these great estates had peons working for them for wages contrived to be always a little loss than the peon could live upon. He must borrow money to live; he could borrow only from the haciendado, and sometimes must pay as high as 90 percent for the use of the money. If he could not pay the money when it fell due he could not legally leave the hacienda; and there were peons in Mexico toiling their lives away trying to pay back money thus borrowed by their great-grandfathers a hundred years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moreover, the owners of these great estates pay next to nothing in the way of taxes and are so powerful that taxes cannot be collected even when levied. It frequently happens that a hacienda covering, literally, millions of acres pays less taxes than an adjoining estate of very limited acreage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mexico's troubles will not be settled until the lands that were stolen from the common people 400 years ago are returned. They have some of their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> back, but they want them all. Those who hold the lands cry out in “holy horror<sup>-</sup>’ that these people are wicked communists. And communism is such a dreadful thing that if you are a Russian, and came to this country when you were two years old, and if you believe in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos, </span><span class="font4">or anything that looks like them, back you go to Russia; for this is the land of the free and we do not stand for anything like </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ejidos</span><span class="font4"> here. No, siree! In this country we believe in letting the wealth get into the hands of the few, the same as in Mexico, and doing everything possible to keep it there. That the people should not desire land, except plots large enough to hold them when they are no longer able to work, seems to be the view of some.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The Bible does not teach communism. The Scriptural proposition regarding restored humanity is, ‘They shall sit every man under </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font4">vine and under </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font4"> fig tree’ (1 Kings 4: 25), subject to neither landlords nor communal ownership, but only to the true God, JEHOVAH, and His King, Christ Jesus.(1 Corinthians 15:28) In the golden age, now at hand, this will be the arrangement in all the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Parentage and Education</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Mexico has approximately two and one-half million white people of Spanish descent, four and one-half million Indians, largely Aztecs, and nine million Mestizos, as they are called, descendants of the two races combined. Few of the Indians are acquainted with the Spanish tongue; they are largely a passive element in the population. By the four and one-half million natives that do not speak Spanish there are spoken fifty different languages and almost innumerable dialects. It is claimed that 80 percent of the people are illiterate; and some have used this as an argument that they are not adapted to self-government. But we reflect that it is only a few<sup>7</sup> generations since England passed laws providing for such of the English lords as could neither read nor write; and it does not at all follow that one who is without ability to read and write may not have as much good common sense as some people who have had great educational advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Indians who were able to keep in a measure aloof from the whites have fared better than those who were enslaved and brought into closer contact with their conquerors. Many of the latter lost their original tribal morality and acquired the vices which have been carried by European civilization throughout the earth: lying, stealing, immorality and drunkenness. Upon these poor peons, as they are called, has fallen the work of producing whatever Mexico has produced, whether in the mines or on the great estates. Fifty years ago these peons were paid as little as six cents per day. The peon needs to be educated and lifted up. He needs to learn how to live. In many districts, back in the interior, the huts are of but one room, and for safety's sake all of the livestock of the family is brought into the room at night, pig, hens, burro and dogs. Mexico’s present enlightened rulers want to rectify these conditions and to make it possible for the peon to occasionally</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">have other food than the tortillas (corn cakes) and coffee, which usually make his meal.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Many Lovable Traits</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Mayor Charles Davis, of El Paso, Texas, after thirty-eight years of experience, says: ‘’There are no better people than the Mexican merchants and professional men, while the Mexican peon is no trouble at all, and is not bloodthirsty if he is let alone.” Travelers report that the Mexicans are among the most polite people in the world. A common form of salutation is, ‘‘May God go with you,” a form of salutation far above that which prevails in the most exclusive and self-satisfied portions of the United States. Hospitality and general goodness of heart are manifest everywhere. Orphans are never left without homes; and in cases of sickness, bereavement or misfortune the sympathy of the neighbors and of the whole community is generous, sincere and practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The family ties of the Mexicans are so strong that the men will go nowhere without their wives. If the men are in service as engineers, firemen, conductors or trainmen, the wives go along as a matter of course. If the men go into battle the wives go along to care for the sick and wounded, to forage for food and to prepare meals for their husbands. The meals prepared under the most trying conditions are said to be remarkable for their neatness and delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mexico has been pictured as a land of sombreros and bare feet; and while it is a fact that there are no skyscrapers, yet there are compensating advantages. The people move leisurely in the streets, the flowers are more plentiful, the food is simpler, the houses are simpler and more beautiful, and the people are sunnier, and sweeter far than some of their neighbors—not mentioning any names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Mexicans have great fondness for art, for literature and for the sciences. They have an instinctive taste for music, a music noted for its pathos, simplicity, and passionate love. A guitar goes with every regiment into battle; and the music which it yields not only is wild, barbaric and impelling, as one would expect in the descendant of the Aztec, but has in it also the grace and romance of the Castilian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A collection of photographs of the governors of Mexican states shows that they compare favorably with an ecpial number of governors of American states. The faces bespeak intelligence, refinement and good breeding.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Mexico’s Political Fight</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As in every other country, the political war which has been waged in Mexico in the past, and which the country still faces, is a fight between liberals and reactionaries. The struggle has taken different forms at different times; and occasionally, as in the United States, men who were elected as liberals have turned out to bo reactionaries, and the light has had to be fought all over again. Too long a lease of power makes any party or any man a reactionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fight in Mexico has ranged around the landless condition of the common people, and the liberals have at all times had the end in view of trying to do something worth while toward the bettering of their condition. When the fight first opened, in 18.57, it was largely against the church, on account of the fact that at that time the church held in fee simple three-fourths of the most valuable real estate in Mexico city: and vast tracts of land and haciendas of fabulous richness were in the possession of the priesthood all over the country while three-fourths of the population were absolutely landless. Many of these great estates were not cultivated, but merely held, tax free, for purposes of speculation. Much of the best real estate in and about Washington, D. C., is now held in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Constitution of 1857, with its amendments of 1873, called the Laws of Reform, provided for liberty of speech, liberty of the press, liberty of faith and worship, the right of all denominations to establish schools and colleges, lawful intermarriage of Catholics and Protestants, public schools for secular education, complete separation of church and state, prohibition of laws establishing or suppressing any religion, prohibition of legal recognition of religious festivals, prohibition of clerical vestments on the streets, prohibition of religious processions in the streets, prohibition of discourses advising disobedience to the law or advocating violence to anyone, prohibition of gifts of real estate to religious institutions except for religious edifices, prohibition of monasteries and convents, prohibition of any law permitting the reestablishment of Jesuits or Sisters of Charity, prohibition of religious vows swearing away one’s liberty, the civil inspection of cemeteries, and the opening of cemeteries for burial of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While these laws were in process of discussion, and as an evidence of how a really good man in the Catholic church viewed the situation, we quote from the Abbe Domenech, chaplain of Napoleon’s expeditionary force to Mexico, words written in 1867:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“If the pope should abolish all simoniaeal livings, and excommunicate all the prieWs having concubines, the, Mexican clergy would be reduced to a very small affair. Nevertheless there arc some worthy men among Ilion, whose conduct as priests is irreproachable. In all Spanish America there are found among the priests the veriest wretches, knaves deserving the gallows, men who make, infamous traffic of religion. Mexico has her share of these wretches. One of the greatest evils in Mexico is the exorbitant fee for the marriage ceremony. The priests compel the poor to live without marriage, by demanding for the nuptial benediction a sum that a Mexican mechanic, with his slender wage, can scarcely accumulate in fifty years of the strictest economy. This is no exaggeration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are glad these words were written by the Abbe Domenech; for if they had been written by others we should have been inclined to think they </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font4"> exaggerated,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Progress in Mexico</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Slavery was abolished in Mexico three years before it was abolished in the United States. The republic has 20,000 miles of up-to-date American railroads, a greater range of remarkable vegetation than any other country in the world; and before the World War it produced one-third of the world's silver, one-ninth of its lead and a good share of its gold. It produces three crops annually and was pronounced by Humboldt the treasure-house of the world. Mexican linens are among the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The city of Mexico has nine hundred streets, but the streets follow the London custom of several different names for the same continuous thoroughfare. These streets are broad, well paved, well kept and bordered with good sidewalks. An efficient and up-to-date traction service covers the city and its environs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The city also has a wonderful sewage system, piercing a mountain thirty miles distant by a tunnel seven miles in length. Through this tunnel are led away the surplus waters which at various times in the past flooded portions of the city.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Real Facts About Mexico</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Major Lynn Dinkins, president of the Interstate Bank of New Orleans, after a six-week tour of Mexico, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We did not see a single bandit or hear of any. We found conditions politically, financially and socially different from the impressions we entertained before cur departure. We traveled more than two thousand miles by railroad within the limits of the Mexican republic. and our trains were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rill on time.</span><span class="font3"> The roadbeds of the Mexican railroads are better than those of the Ameilean lines.' ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">William IL Ellis, New York hanker and broker, is authority for the statement, &quot;Mexico without a doubt is the richest spot on the face of the earth, and I have often thought that this is why there is so much trouble in that country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">John Lind, ex-governor of Minnesota, once President Wilson’s personal representative in Mexico, says that anarchistic American business men in Mexico have attempted to evade payment of taxes in Mexico that were propel’ and right, and that they have caused annoyance and embarrassment by objecting to laws and taxes which the Mexican government imposed and attempted to enforce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He states that many Americans have not treated the natives well, adding, “I saw American-owned plantations where peons were herded by guards armed with revolvers, sawed-off shotguns and blacksnake whips. They were slaves to all intents and purposes. I came to the conclusion that it is impossible for Americans to operate tropical estates without these conditions, and that it was a very great misfortune that they ever became involved in them. It only begets strife, ill feeling and revolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mexicans claim that no honest, fair-minded Americans ever came to Mexico to go into business who did not succeed, but that they have noticed that Americans have always given support to every anti-governmental outbreak, and that it is not to be wondered at that such citizens are viewed with suspicion. There are thousands of Mexican laborers in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, on the ranches, in stores, at work on the roads; and there are no more law-abiding or capable workers to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Europe's system of doing business with Mexico is to give four to eight months’ credit, while America's system is to demand cash with order.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>A Poor, Deceived, Simple-Hearted People</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The native Mexicans are a poor, easily deceived, simple-hearted people. For centuries the demons have taken dreadful advantage of their natural reverence. The Roman Catholic system merely shifted their superstitions. The worst frauds were practiced upon them. Thus, the Mexican historian Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta concludes that the story of the miraculous appearance of the “virgin of Guadalupe” has no foundation in fact; but what a money-maker it has been for those that have managed the deception ! To approach this church, with its fabulously wealthy gold and silver fittings, the poor natives were required to crawl on their hands and knees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cathedral in Mexico city is the largest church building in the Western Hemisphere and the oldest still in use. It stands on the site where once stood the Aztec temple of Tenochtitlan razed by Cortez. In the early days “conversions” were often obtained by military coercion. Later the treasures of the natives in gold or silver were obtained by heavy exactions and were worked up into church ornaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mexico, having learned something the United States never learned, now has a law that no Mexican chief executive can be reelected. He is thus enabled to give his best efforts to the welfare of the country instead of to the problem of how to get reelected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Determined to unload the Old Man of the Sea that has held everything back for four hundred years, the present generation of Mexican statesmen has made it hard going for the Roman Catholic system. Thus in Vera Cruz there is a law in effect that there may be but one priest for each 100,000 of population. There are almost equally severe limitations in the states of Chiapas, Queretaro and Jalisco. In the state of Tabasco no priests at all are allowed. The people have suffered so much from their rascality that they want nothing more to do with them, but want to be let alone, to be born, to live, to marry and to die without their officious interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A first-class modern highway will shortly connect Laredo, Texas, with Mexico city. The people are beginning to hear and to receive the message of God’s kingdom. What a grand future there is before such a fine country and such a fine people! An odd item in the news is that Hotel Geneve, Mexico city, heated by the hot-water system, was the only heated hotel in Mexico in the year 1932.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>The Central American Family</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Central American Family, so called, includes, from west to east, in the order named, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. These were once all parts of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which included everything between the Isthmus of Panama and the Mississippi, Missouri and Columbia rivers. In other words, Mexico, if it had retained all its territory, was about equal in size to the whole United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Guatemala, which at one time dominated all Central America, is of the size of New York state, with an estimated population of 2,454,000. On Gil Gonzalez’s first expedition into this land he emerged with 32,000 scalps dangling at his belt, i.e., he baptized that number of Indians. They had to become baptized and be ‘good Roman Catholics' or be dead Indians, and as they were peaceably disposed they took what looked like the best way out. There are numerous policemen in New Jersey, also Roman Catholics, who seem to have learned what they know of “religion” by somewhat similar methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 60 percent of the population of Guatemala is pure Indian ; most of the remainder are half-castes. There are over 700 miles of railways. Education is compulsory. Exports in 1897 were $34,000,000. Most of the population is on the narrow west coast. A great part of the country is undeveloped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">El Salvador, about the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut, is a one-crop country. Its prosperity depends on coffee. It has luxuriant forests and abundant mineral deposits awaiting development. The population is 1,459,578, two-thirds Indians and Mestizos. The capital has been wrecked by earthquakes twelve times since 1539 and is so subject to rockings and tremblings of the earth as to have acquired the name of ‘the swinging hammock’. Education is compulsory. Exports in 1928 were $24,463,860.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Honduras, of the size of Pennsylvania, has the distinction of having the only capital in the Western world that is not located upon a railway. It is, however, located on a very good automobile road, 82 miles from the nearest port. In subjugating Honduras, on account of its impassable swamps, the conquering Spaniards had to make friends of the Indians, who became and are to this day mostly Spanish-speaking Indians. The population is 859,761. The country is very fertile, but undeveloped. There are 1,065 miles of railways, laid out mostly to serve the banana industry.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Nicaragua is of the size of New York state, with a population of 750,000. It is famous as the site of the most natural route across the Isthmus of Panama. Nicaragua lake, 106 feet above the Pacific ocean, is separated from that body of water by a strip of land 12 miles wide, which is at no point more than 150 feet above sea level. It once emptied into the Pacific, but now empties into the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real reason why Uncle Sam is always messing in Nicaragua affairs is that he knows a good canal there could be constructed for less than it cost to construct the Panama canal. (The Nicaragua canal route would be 177 miles from ocean to ocean, of which 55 miles would be improved river navigation and 70 miles would he in Lake Nicaragua.) Uncle Sam, in 1914, at a cost of $3,000,000, obtained the exclusive right to build such a canal. The Nicaraguan region is extremely volcanic. From the roof of St. Peter's cathedral in Leon (which cathedral was built at a cost of $5,000,000 when labor was valued at 25 cents a day) thirteen volcanoes may be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States Government has finally taken a tumble to itself, and in 1936 will withdraw its troops from Nicaragua. The holding of these troops there cost the United States taxpayers more than $5,500,000 and aroused resentment all over Central America and South America. While the troops were there the Government gave out at least four separate and different reasons as to why they were ever sent there in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Costa Rica, of the combined size of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut, differs from other countries of Central America in the fact that out of its population of 515,000, only 3,500 are Indians, and there are 18,000 West Indian Negroes, who live near the coast, but the rest are whites. Coffee is the chief crop. More than half the area lies over 3,000 feet above sea level and is covered with virgin forests so dense that it is almost impossible to penetrate it except by the river courses. There are unusual scenic charms. The country has risen rapidly in importance since the days of the French, Dutch and British raids on the Panama coast, and has a great future before it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Panama is of size equal to Costa Rica. Five-eighths of the territory is unoccupied. Formerly a department of Colombia, it declared its independence in 1903 and was recognized by the United States ten days later. In return for the right to build the Panama canal the United States gave the republic of Panama $10,000,000 in cash and $250,000 per year. A description of the canal appears in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> No. 323.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>At Last We Get to South America</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In a previous issue we expressed our intention to make some examination of the countries that go to make up South America. We suggested that if Brazil be omitted, or if it be cut out, what is left of the continent looks like an interrogation mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And then somebody had to spoil it all by calling attention to the fact that such interrogation mark would be in reverse. Very well, then. Imagine yourself in China, looking through a glass globe. The big continent in the southern half of the globe is South America. And if Brazil is cut out the interrogation mark is right side up and left side around as all good interrogation marks should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Understand, then, that in our next issue we begin with the mainland of South America. We start with the Guianas, and mention all three of them, though only French Guiana could be called a Latin American state. There is nothing Latin about the Dutch and English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Health Program </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE first thing in the morning drink grapefruit juice, lemon juice, orange juice, pineapple juice, or a drink made from the first three fruits here named, or other fresh fruit juice. Or, a good body-cleansing and poison-eliminating drink can also be made by taking one-half grapefruit, washing it well and dicing it, and pouring one pint of boiling water over it and allowing it to stand in a covered dish over night. Be sure you </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do not use aluminum or tin</span><span class="font4"> to let it stand in; better a crock or dish, with a plate over it. The acid has a reaction on aluminum dishes especially, and the fruit juices are changed somewhat in action if these are used. This drink can be warmed if you like, and, if it is too bitter, a small amount of orange juice added to it to make it more palatable. It is from the rind of the grapefruit that the bitter elements come, and it is their action that is very helpful in increasing the action of the liver and other eliminative organs. This should be made </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fresh</span><span class="font4"> every day, as it is not good if allowed to stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Friction Bath</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a well ventilated room take a dry friction rub with friction mittens, to warm the skin and start the blood circulating. The entire body should be gone over with quick, light motions until the body can stand heavier pressure and the roughness of the mittens. Refer to the article “Friction Bathing” for details on this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If no bath is taken in the morning, then precede the friction bath by washing the face, hands and feet and genitals. Refer to “Water Bathing” article for greater detail on different kinds of bathing, frequency, etc., and their effect on various physical conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Exercise</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take fifteen to twenty minutes of general exercise, to music if you like. Good exercises are given over the radio each a.m. Also refer to special exercises in articles on “Exercise” (varied exercise), “Special Organ Exercise,” etc. Be sure to take these exercises in a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">zvell ventilated,</span><span class="font4"> room. If possible, have all the windows open and have the body nude. You will not take cold if you keep moving and if you have preceded this exercise with a good friction rub. If it is still too cold put on a light suit of underwear or a bathing suit. Remember, the body will get most benefit if least hampered with clothing, and this is an excellent time to give the skin a chance to breathe also. Remember, skin elimination is most essential in all toxic conditions. During ordinary daily activity the skin is supposed to eliminate as much fluid and poison in visible and invisible perspiration as do the kidneys. Such conditions as rheumatism, liver trouble, constipation, catarrh, sinus trouble, tonsilitis, female trouble, skin disorders, headaches, etc., are all benefited by improved skin elimination. Elimination from the bowels, kidneys and lungs must also be watched and assisted by diet and a proper restoration of nerve force and energy by such methods as chiropractic. Remember, no matter how carefully you live you cannot always correct the condition yourself if the nerves that supply the various organs of elimination are not free from pressure; so chiropractic and proper living go hand in hand. One or the other may be enough to rectify your condition, but it generally takes both to get real and permanent results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Exercises should be followed by a shower (preferably warm and gradually cooled, followed by a quick rub-down). The cold shower is stimulating and invigorating and benefits muscular tone. Refer to “Water Bathing” article for further detail on various types of bath for different conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Breathing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Breathe deeply and rhythmically at all times, and always be careful of ventilation. Gas heat is very poor; steam or wood fires, best; and then always have some outside air by opening windows or door from a place where no draught will be produced. People who chill easily will be less troubled if they improve ventilation and take the friction rubs. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Remember, FRESH AIR is more essential than either food or drink.</span><span class="font4"> Refer to “Breathing” article for further detail. Remember, pure oxygen is absolutely necessary to make food digest and assimilate. One will die within five minutes without oxygen, and one can live for ten days, and longer, without water, and from thirty to forty days, and longer, without food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the above detail may seem very unnecessary; but get the day started right even if you have to get up an hour earlier, and you will find you can do twice as much work, with less trouble, and be twice as happy while you are doing it, and have just that much more time left for other recreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After this much of the regime you should feel exhilarated; but if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">at first</span><span class="font4"> you feel some exhaustion, rest a few minutes before proceeding to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Breakfast</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This, really, is the best meal for fruit, in most cases. Take as much as you like of some </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fresh </span><span class="font4">fruit; be careful to wash it well, and also eat the peeling as well: it aids elimination. With this can be taken cottage cheese, or a few nuts or part of an avocado or some cream, goat’s milk, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">raiv</span><span class="font4"> cow’s milk (not pasteurized), or a lightly poached egg or two (be careful of the latter if you are inclined to liver trouble or biliousness, on account of the large quantity of sulphur and phosphorus in the egg yolk). Refer to the “Breakfast Menus” for further detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This may seem like starvation regime; but, as you see from the preceding paragraphs, food is less essential than either air or water. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Almost all of us eat too much.</span><span class="font4"> Thin people grow thinner eating an excess of the supposed-to-be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fattening</span><span class="font4"> foods. A heavier diet will be all right after the system has been thoroughly cleansed. Too much food in wrong combinations taken at the wrong time forces an extra duty on the already overburdened organs of elimination to the point where diseases of the liver, stomach, intestines, etc., ensue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">After breakfast</span><span class="font4"> rest for a few minutes it you are tired. If you are working, walk to work if possible, so as to get the benefit of the air and sunshine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sun Bath</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take this about 10 a.m., earlier or later according to the weather; but never directly after a meal, liefer to ‘‘Sun-Bathing” article for details of how to take the bath, why it is essential in various diseases, how to protect yourself from adverse effects, etc. If you are taking the sun bath you can defer the shower (suggested as to be taken after the exercises) until after the sun bath. There is nothing quite like </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sunshine</span><span class="font4"> to assist one in regaining health and to keep in a state of health. Even our food digests better when we get sunshine, for the sun’s rays are actually life-giving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Noon Meal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This can be variable; but the lighter the meal, the better, when one is trying to regain health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A quart of buttermilk with a few </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dried, unsulphured</span><span class="font4"> figs is a very fine meal. Buttermilk is excellent for the bowels. Do not use buttermilk that is not the churned variety. Avocado mixes excellently with buttermilk in many cases. Some people use apples with buttermilk very successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Raw foods used at noon are very fine; any raw vegetables, chosen from the “Non-Starchy Vegetables” list, the leafy ones made into salad form and the root vegetables ground with a food grinder or chopped very fine. A little mayonnaise can be used as a dressing; or, when nonstarch is used at this meal, a little French dressing made of lemon juice and olive oil may be used. Refer to “Salad” lists for suggestions; also to “Menu” lists. This meal can include one or two pieces of real whole-wheat bread or rye bread or muffins or whole-wheat toast if no sour dressing is used or no acid vegetable, such as tomatoes. A cooked vegetable can be added to this meal, referring to the lists mentioned above. But the best idea is the raw food, when one has become used to it, or the buttermilk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If possible take a short nap, or at least rest, after lunch. Do not draw the blood from the stomach by excess activity either physical or mental; especially not if the meal is a heavier one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Middle of the Afternoon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have a glass or two of raw vegetable juices, such as celery, or cooked vegetable juices, such as spinach juice, summer squash or string bean juice, or any of the juices made from the non-starchy vegetables referred to above; in some eases, a cup of Alvita (an alfalfa drink) or malted nuts, or other non-stimulating beverages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take a walk before the evening meal if possible. Do not go to the table tired; rest a few minutes if the walk has tired you. If one is overtired, angry or worried, the meal does not digest properly, as these emotions </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font4"> influence the character of the digestive juices. So at all times constructive thinking and a happy frame of mind are to be cultivated if one is to get the best results from any living regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Erening Meal</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Make the evening meal a protein or* starch meal as a base, with one or two cooked non-starchy vegetables and a salad, according to what the other meals of the day have contained. Refer to “Starch Menu” and “Protein Menu” lists, also to “Raw Salad” lists and to “Combination” lists, for further detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rest or have some light recreation after the evening meal. Before retiring take the exercise suggested for the morning, and the friction bath, and, if possible, a short walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In general, the diet should consist about three fourths of foods chosen from the “Xon-Starehy Vegetables” class and the “Fruit” class. The remaining one fourth should be chosen from the vegetable “Starches” and the “Protein” class: one meal a day being </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fruit</span><span class="font4"> and what will combine with it, one containing some starch and the balance non-starchy vegetables, and the other containing protein in combination with either acid fruits or non-starchy vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Health is the most valuable thing in the world. Make </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(jetting well</span><span class="font4"> your business, and so be much happier, more efficient, and more able to be of service to your fellow man. A life lived for personal or selfish reasons alone is never the complete and full and happy life. To be able to live either the personal or the humanitarian life, one must be well; and to be well, one must follow the natural, God-given laws of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">H</span><span class="font4">A. Scott, of California, asserts: “A five-• cent meal may be prepared as follows: Place one quart of water in a shallow pan or kettle; add one teaspoon of salt, two heaping tablespoons of graham flour (or corn meal or any cereal except white flour); stir frequently while bringing to a boil. Stir and pour off one pint of the liquid in a convenient cup. Stir into the remaining pint two heaping tablespoons of the flour, bring to a boil, stir and set off. Add one egg and stir. The result is a full hot meal with a hot drink. With eggs at three cents each, the material cost would be five cents. Incidentally, you have a health diet at less than a course of pills or salts.”</span></p>

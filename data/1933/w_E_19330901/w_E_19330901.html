<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to Efe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the' Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the estab-Eshment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shaE be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>JUDGMENT AND EXECUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.’’—Jer. 1:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH favored the Israelites above all peoples of earth at that time. He made a covenant with them and kept his part of the covenant faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Had Israel kept its part of the covenant it would have been greatly blessed. Because of unfaithfulness Jehovah caused his judgment to be written against Israel, and sent his prophets to declare his judgments and in due time caused them to be executed upon that nation. The Israelites as a people foreshadowed “Christendom”; and what came to pass unto Israel will come to pass on “Christendom”, only on a far greater scale. The nations which constitute “Christendom” have been favored above all peoples of the earth, because they have had access to the Word of God and have been taught of and concerning his kingdom and have taken the name of Christ and accepted God’s Word, and have entered into an implied covenant to do the will of God. Now because of the wickedness of “Christendom” God has caused his judgment not only to be Written but to be made known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah wrote his judgments long in advance of the time of execution, and now he discloses the meaning thereof to his anointed and sends forth the anointed to make announcement of the same. Jehovah’s witnesses are severely criticized because of their plainness of speech in declaring the vengeance of Jehovah against Satan’s organization. The clergy and their allies, including the “evil servant”, say that these witnesses should be prevented from “slandering the other religions”. They do not know that the remnant represent no “religion”, as that term is understood, but that they do represent the Lord God. Those who claim to be of the truth but who oppose the witness work of the Lord now in progress on earth say that such criticism of Satan’s organization is needless and wrong. The faithful will not be at all disturbed by such adverse criticism, but will see that Jehovah makes it obligatory upon his witnesses to cry out the declaration of his vengeance, serving notice upon the enemy and warning those who desire to learn the way of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•The prophet Zechariah, in the fifth chapter, records a vision of a flying roll. “Then I turned, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">259</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.” (Zech. 5:1,2) A roll is a written record. (Ezra 6: 2) What Zechariah saw was a record of Jehovah’s judgment against the enemy. (Zech. 5:3) One side of the record is leveled against thieves, and the other side against liars. It is not stored away in some musty vault, but is flying like an airplane, swiftly to its destination. “As the swallow in her flying, so the curse that is causeless alighteth not.” (Prov. 26:2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.') </span><span class="font3">But here there is a good and sufficient cause ■ hence the curse comes swiftly. It is a message written in God’s Word called “the volume of the book”. (Ps. 40:7) To help Zechariah, now the remnant, to discern the meaning thereof, Jehovah gives ‘seeing eyes’, that is, understanding. (Prov. 20:12) The measure of the “roll” is shown to be fifteen by thirty feet, which is a great size for a record. It was unrolled and spread out flat; otherwise it could not have been measured on both sides. The dimensions equal the area of “the holy” in the tabernacle in the wilderness, and suggest that the message thereof applies particularly to all who profess to be representatives of God in the land of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CURSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> A curse is a solemn and irrevocable declaration of what shall be the fate of those who deliberately violate God’s law. The “flying roll”, written on both sides, contains a message of God’s vengeance against covenant-breakers. “Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth; for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that swear-eth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.” (Zech. 5:3) It could not go forth over the face of the earth until after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment. The facts show that it began to go forth in 1922, when there was a “great voice out of the temple”, saying to the seven angels: ‘Go forth, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the whole earth.’ (Rev. 16:1) The religious element</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">of “Christendom” assume to be in a covenant with Jehovah God because of their taking the name of Christ and pretending to rely upon God’s Word. This particularly applies to the elergy, who have stolen the Word of God and taken away the key of knowledge. (Luke 11:52) “Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets [false preachers], saith the Lord, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">” (Jer. 23:30) </span><span class="font3">The clergy and their allies in “Christendom” have “transgressed the laws [of God, and] broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.” (Isa. 24: 5, 6; Mal. 4:5,6) They have turned many people away from God, like Absalom, who stole the hearts of the people, and this they have done in order to serve the Devil. (2 Sam. 15:6) The curse is also against the “evil servant” class, the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” These have deliberately stolen away from God’s organization the weaker ones and turned them into the Devil’s company. “If a man be found stealing [away from God’s organization] any of his brethren of the children of [spiritual] Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die. ’ ’ (Deut. 24:7) This prophecy, which is a part of the covenant God made with Israel in Moab, applies specifically to those who have responded to the call to the kingdom, and this is emphasized by the fact that the kingdom covenant was foreshadowed by the covenant made in Moab. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1933, page 163) “Through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you.” (2 Pet. 2: 3) The “evil servant” class has formed a partnership with the clergy in opposing the kingdom message. (Ps. 50:18; Prov. 29:24) The curse pronounced against such thieves is destruction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> This curse Christ Jesus pronounces when at the temple for judgment. (Mal. 3:5) ‘False swearers’ are those who have made a covenant to do the will of God and then willingly violate it. (Ps. 24:4; Lev. 19:12) False swearers have been warned by the Lord. (Eccl. 8:2) It is wicked for one to practice a religion that ignores Jehovah God; but when men claim to worship Jehovah and to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, and use such as a cloak for their hypocrisy, that is gross wickedness. The religion mislabeled “Christianity” or “Christendom” was adopted by the seventh world power as its religion, and for centuries the clergy of “organized Christianity” have hypocritically posed as the teachers of God’s Word, have lied to the weaker ones as well as to others, and have used the texts of the Scriptures as a camouflage for their crookedness, and by this means have turned the people away from God. They well know that they have sworn falsely. Likewise those who have entered into a covenant to do God’s will, and responded to the call for the kingdom, and who now oppose the proclamation of the message of the kingdom, have sworn falsely before Jehovah God. The curse will visit the habitations of these wicked ones, just as certainly as that the angel of the Lord visited each house in Egypt.—Ex. 12: 23,29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> “ I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.” (Zech. 5:4) The curse will locate the wrongdoers wherever they are, even though they may say, Who seeth us? Jehovah leaves no way of escape for them. The message of the curse reaches them by radio, telephone and in printed form, and goes into their hiding places and sweeps away ‘the hiding place of lies’. The fact that the prophet says that ‘the curse shall remain in the midst of their house’ shows that they are incorrigibly wicked and will be destroyed. —Jer. 23:29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> Those who oppose the truth will not believe what is here written. Only those who lift their eyes to heaven and go in faith to God and obediently follow Christ Jesus are given this vision and the understanding thereof. “Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.” (Zech. 5:5) The angel of the Lord now discloses to the remnant the permanent place of wickedness. Satan began his wicked hypocritical religious organization on the plains of Shinar, which organization is symbolized by a woman, Satan’s wife, whose name is called “Babylon”. That devilish hypocritical organization has at all times stolen the Word of God and misused it, and has stolen the people away from serving God and has produced a crop of creatures that have sworn falsely before God. These religious frauds who are defamers of Jehovah’s name are to be transported to their everlasting abode.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The prophet inquires of the angel, “What is it?” and is told: ‘ ‘ This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land.” (Zech. 5: 6, A.E.V.) The prophecy thus shows how it appears to the eyes of Jehovah, who determines and metes out judgment. The ephah is a large measure and symbolizes a large measure of something. A measure denotes judgment; therefore this prophecy means that Jehovah has measured out or judged, and that the measure is large against those denounced by the judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> The ephah had a lid or covering of heavy material like lead on it, and inside the ephah appeared a woman sitting. (Zech. 5:7) The lid was of a base metal having the appearance of silver and therefore pictures hypocrisy, which is so successfully practiced by the Devil’s religious agents; which base covering will be destroyed. (Jer. 6:29; Ezek. 22:18) The power of Jehovah lifts up this lid or covering and exposes what is inside the ephah, and therein appears a woman.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This woman is evidently the Devil’s wife, that is, his hypocritical organization called “Babylon”. This organization gave birth to the thieves and the liars and all other lawless ones. (Rev. 17: 3, 5) Satan’s organization is entirely wicked. Concerning the woman sitting in the ephah the angel spoke: “And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.” (Zech. 5:8) “Wickedness,” in this text, means “Lawlessness” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.),</span><span class="font3"> and particularly applies to the class whom the Lord gathers out from among his covenant people. (Matt. 13:41) This would specifically apply to the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” and all the clergy, who claim to serve God but who in fact serve the Devil. The lid was lifted up, exposing this wicked woman, and then she was pushed back inside of the ephah and the lid or covering was closed down. Thus the Lord crates her up for transportation to where she belongs. She has no place in the “holy land”, the condition of God’s people, but is taken to her own place, which later the angel of the Lord explains to Zechariah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The Lord’s method of gathering out and transporting this hypocritical crowd, which is the very embodiment of lawlessness, now appears: “Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.” (Zech. 5: 9) Undoubtedly these two women are servants of the Lord God and of the great Judge at his temple. Being females, they would be subject to the “man Christ Jesus”. (1 Cor. 11: 3) They therefore fitly picture the angels used by the Lord to gather out the wicked ones and to keep them away from the temple. “The Son of man shall send forth his angels [symbolized by these two women], and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things [that were in line for the kingdom] that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13: 41,42) The prophecy says, “The wind was in their wings,” which signifies that the power of God was with them for the swift performance of his judgment. The wings show that they are creatures that fly swiftly before judgment. ‘Having wings like a stork’s’ shows that they knew the time of judgment and that the judgment time had come: “Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; . . . but my people [professed people, who are lawless] know not the judgment of the Lord.” (Jer. 8:7) The stork's wings are large and able to lift heavy loads. Storks fly at a great height, and the prophecy says, “They lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven” and transported the old woman, the personification of lawlessness, swiftly to her everlasting abiding place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Where does “wickedness”, pictured by the occupant of the ephah, belong! This question was propounded by Zechariah, in verse ten, to which question the angel of the Lord replied: ‘ ‘ And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar; and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. ’ ’ (Zech. 5:11) The land of Shinar was the place where Satan began his organization, to turn the people away from Jehovah by means of lying and stealing; hence that land represents the beginning of lawlessness. “And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” (Gen. 11:2,4) The covenant people of God were carried away captive into the land of Shinar. (Dan. 1:1, 2) Jehovah restored the remnant of his people in due time, then as he has now restored his faithful remnant, taking them away from Satan’s organization, and bringing them into his own organization. “In that day . . . the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people.” (Isa. 11:11) Jehovah’s swift messengers, flying like storks, bear the lawless or wicked class back to the place assigned to that crowd, and that place prepared for her was symbolized by the land of Shinar. “An house,” as here used, to which the woman “Wickedness” is taken, pictures a condition of perpetual death. “The grave is mine house.” (Job 17:13) “All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.” (Isa. 14:18) A house denotes a place to stay, and this picture shows lawlessness assigned to a condition of everlasting destruction. The curse of Jehovah upon the wicked organization of Satan is a vindication of his holy name, and shows what shall be the result in the great war. Wickedness shall be destroyed for ever.—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah of hosts is the almighty God of Battle. He has a fixed time for war and a fixed time for peace, and by making war he will establish everlasting peace among his creatures. When he sent Jesus Christ forth to reign in the midst of his enemies, war in heaven immediately followed, and Christ Jesus was the victor. The field of military action is then transferred to the earth, and the forces for the great combat must be prepared. In the first vision of the prophet there appeared a company of horsemen led by their Chief, who was Christ Jesus, and the first work of which was to make a careful survey or inspection of things in the earth before beginning operations. Horses symbolize war equipment, and that advance company of horsemen spying out the land shows that the Lord’s forces are preparing for the greatest war on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> During the building of the temple Zechariah was again given a vision of the militant organization of Jehovah. That means that while Christ Jesus is gathering his true followers to himself into the temple of God these faithful ones are given a vision of Jehovah’s great war organization. The prophet looked again and tells what he saw. “And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.” (Zech. 6:1) “Chariots” are symbols of Jehovah’s militant organization, and there being four chariots means that God’s organization is a four-square one, fully equipped to push the enemy from every point and to completely defeat and destroy him. “For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all'flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.” (Isa. 66:15,16) “Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.” (Joel 2:5; Hab. 3:8) These war chariots’ coming out from between two mountains of brass symbolizes that they are exceedingly strong, and the “brass” (copper) shows that they are beyond the earthly quality, therefore superhuman, and are sent by Jehovah, and hence are in no way a part of Satan’s earthly government. These chariots picture the fighting organization of Jehovah God under the leadership of Christ Jesus. In the fire these mountains would not become “a burnt mountain”, such as Satan’s organization will become. (Jer. 51:25) The fighting organization of Jehovah will in the fire of battle glow with brightness like the feet of Christ Jesus, as seen in the vision of John: “And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.” (Rev. 1:15) “And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass. ’’ (Rev. 2:18) Both Daniel and Ezekiel had a vision of this Mighty One and say that ‘his arms and feet looked like polished brass’. (Dan. 10:6) “Whose appearance was like the appearance of.brass.” (Ezek. 40:3) These “mountains of brass” together picture the universal organization of Jehovah and also the capital organization thereof, coming forth with the military equipment after the war in heaven had ended. It is “out of the mountain” or organization universal that the “stone was cut out without hands”; whereas the Stone or capital organization, the anointed King, grew to be “a great mountain [that] filled the whole earth”, and is therefore the capital or chief part of Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“The horse-drawn war chariots seemed to appear at the same time, all moving abreast. By having in mind now that the Jews’read from right to left, this picture would indicate that the first horses and chariot to be observed would be on the extreme right. “In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses, and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.” (Zech. 6:2, 3) These chariots drawn by horses show preparation for and moving into position for the great battle. The horses on the extreme right are called ‘ * red ’ according to the Hebrew, and are called ‘ ‘ bay ’ ’, in verse seven. The second chariot is drawn by black horses, the third on the left center by white horses, and the fourth by “grisled and bay </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> strong] horses”. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font3"> renders this part of the text “grizzled strong horses”, and which are on the extreme left and go to the south and are thus distinguished from bay horses on the extreme right.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> The prophet asked the angel the meaning of the chariots and the horses, and the answer is: “And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> winds] of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.” (Zech. 6:4,5) These picture the organization of Jehovah God “who maketh his angels spirits”. (Ps. 104:4) It is a complete organization, because it is symbolized by four, and at the same time is heavenly, and includes the remnant on earth who have been made to “sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus”. (Eph. 1:3; 2:6) The faithful remnant in the temple have been ‘delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of Jehovah’s dear Son’. (Col. 1:13) The Lord by his angels has gathered out the remnant and brought them together since 1918, “from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” (Matt. 24:31; Zech. 2:6) These four spirits have an approved standing before Jehovah, and they willingly serve him in this day. (Ps. 110:3) They come forth from presenting themselves unto the Lord, the same as the seven men described in the ninth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“ Babylon is on the north of Palestine, hence called “the north country”. (Zech. 2: 6, 7; Jer. 10:22) The earthly Babylon was overthrown eighteen years before Zechariah began to prophesy; hence this prophecy must apply to Satan’s organization which bears the name of Babylon, and applies particularly to “Gog, of the land of Magog”, concerning which Ezekiel prophesied. (Ezek. 38:2,15; 39:2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Zechariah sees “the black horses [which draw the second chariot] go forth into the north country”. (Zech. 6:6) That division of the Lord’s army takes its position for the assault against the strongholds of Satan’s organization which are led by Satan’s prince Gog and move out for action. “And the white [horses drawing the third chariot] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font3"> forth after them.” (Zech. 6:6) These two horse-drawn chariots assaulting the north country comport with the facts that two armies under two kings together assaulted and destroyed literal Babylon. “Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” (Dan. 5:28) There are two divisions of Gog’s army, the invisible and the visible division, both of which are in the conspiracy against God’s anointed people, and both must be attacked and destroyed by the army of the Lord. The two chariots, the second and third, moving against the enemy here picture Jehovah’s sanctified ones, employed to destroy “the earth”. (Zeph. 3:8) “I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. They come from a far country [from heaven, and are no part of this world at any time], even the Lord [leading his army], and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land [Babylon, the north country or stronghold of Satan’s organization]. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.”—Isa. 13:3,5,19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The grizzled horses wheel their war chariot into position on the south line of battle: “The grisled [spotted, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.] go</span><span class="font3"> forth toward the south country.” (Zech. 6:6) These horses draw the fourth chariot, and in the third verse of the prophecy they are called ‘ ‘ grisled and bay horses ’ ’. Edom or Idumea (the northern section was also called Teman), Egypt and Ethiopia, all are south of the Holy Land. The prophecy, therefore, must refer to the antitypes of these countries, because those countries suffered defeat prior to the time of Zechariah’s prophecy. In the prophecy Edom or Idumea pictures the “wicked servant” class, the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition”; Egypt pictures Satan’s visible organization, made up of the commercial, political and religious elements; and Ethiopia represents the hireling military strong-arm squad. All of these shall fall at Armageddon, and Jehovah’s forces are moving into position for the attack. (Jer. 25:15,16) Ezekiel’s prophecy shows that the hireling crowd in particular joins forces with Gog in making the assault on Jehovah’s covenant people, and which shows a combining of the enemy forces north and south against the anointed of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The bay horses of verse seven represent the remnant of God’s anointed people on the earth. These are the same as those mentioned in verse two as “red horses”. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font3"> designates them as “strong” horses, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> refers to them as “deep red”. These horses are not the grizzled or bay (of verse three) which draw the fourth chariot. These “deep red” horses, of verses two and seven, draw the first chariot on the extreme right and would be the first ones to be observed by the covenant people of God; and this is in accord with the facts. They picture God’s remnant people on the earth who are pictured by Ezekiel under the symbol of 'the man in linen with the writer’s inkhorn by his side’ who scatters fire over the city. (See Ezekiel 9 and 10.) These horses drawing the first chariot symbolically say: The witness work, or ‘marking in the foreheads’, must be done before the battle of the great day is fought. “And the bay went forth, and sought to go, that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.” (Zech. 6:7) The fact that these “sought to go” proved that they were willing in the day of the King's power, ready to obey the command to go throughout the earth and preach the gospel of the kingdom. (Matt. 24:14; Ps. 110:3) The angel of the Lord said to this remnant: ‘ ‘ Get you hence, walk to and fro”; meaning that they must busy themselves in the witness work. This was their signal to go. Note how the Lord by his angels directs the movements of his people, and that without their knowledge at the time. It was on the 8th day of September, 1922, when a convention of Jehovah’s people had learned that Christ Jesus is at the temple for judgment and that there was much work for them to do, that the Lord caused these words to be spoken to the assembled multitude: “Do you believe that the Lord is now in his temple, judging the nations of earth ? ’ ’ The multitude shouted: “Yes!” The speaker continued: “Do you believe that the King of glory has begun his reign?” “Yes!” responded the multitude. “Then back to the field, 0 ye sons of the Most High God! . . . Herald the message far and wide. The world must know that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords. This is the day of all days. Behold, the King reigns! You are his publicity agents. Therefore advertise, advertise, advertise the King and his kingdom.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1922, page 337) In obedience to the Lord’s command the faithful remnant then went forth and walked through the earth proclaiming the message of the kingdom, and are still at that work. They asking how long this work must continue, the Lord makes it known that it must continue until the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Isa. 6:11) The army of the Lord is on the trek and the day of war draws nigh.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> The division of the army that moves against the enemy in the north country does the chief part of the work. “Then cried he upon [unto] me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. ’ ’ (Zech. 6:8) The war chariots drawn by the black horses and white horses move against Gog in the land of Magog, and this is pleasing to Jehovah; showing that this is the division of his army that vindicates his name. “These . . . have quieted (the indignation of) my spirit” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font3"> ; “have settled my spirit,” or, “caused mine anger to rest.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.,</span><span class="font3"> footnote) These bring satisfaction to the spirit of Jehovah because they execute his vengeance upon Satan’s organization. (Ezek. 39:6) This work they do after the witness work by the earthly division is completed. The division pictured by the grizzled horses that move on “the south country”, the earthly part of Satan’s organization, do their part to the pleasure of Jehovah; but the division that destroys the invisible enemy, Gog and all those of the land of Magog, do the chief executing work. The earthly division of Satan’s army is merely the ally of Gog and in the conspiracy. After the fall of his organization, then Satan the old Dragon is bound and put to death. (Rev. 20:1-3) All of this must be done before Jehovah’s name is completely vindicated. Satan’s organization, head, body and tail, must be destroyed, and then Jehovah will be pleased. (Ezek. 5:13; 16:42; 21:17; 24:13) The fact that the leader of the army cries with a loud and positive command to this division moving on Gog shows that the army is moving into action and the noise of battle is on. All of this proves that Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth are not the ones that put the Devil’s organization out of business, but that they must do their witness work before the big fight is really on. The remnant could not accomplish the destruction of the enemy by bearing witness for a million years. They present themselves and perform their part according to the will of God, and then the great war follows. At this point in the prophecy the vision changes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VINDICATOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Those who are members of Jehovah’s organization and who faithfully perform their part of participating in the vindication of his name may properly be designated as vindicators. Christ Jesus is the Head and the Chief One, and therefore he is the great Vindicator, and the work done by the earthly members of his organization is very insignificant; yet the prophet of God gives attention here to the temple company, both Head and body, manifestly for the comfort and encouragement of the remnant on the earth. The builders of the temple of Jerusalem had been in captivity and were now released. Those who now have part in the building of the real temple, and who are yet on the earth, were once in captivity, and these now bring their little all, pictured by the silver and gold, to be used in connection with the temple work. “And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.” (Zech. 6:9, 10) The captives have returned and come to Zion, which is God’s organization. The names given in this verse of the prophecy are significant. “Heldai” (evidently the same one called “Hclem” [“Strength”] in verse fourteen) means “worldly; enduring; long-lived”; the name “Tobijah” means “pleasing to Jehovah”; the name “Jedaiah” means “Jehovah has known ; Jehovah cares (for him) ”. The meanings of the names of these mentioned appear to apply collectively to the remnant. “Heldai,” the remnant, being in the world and having a transient existence here, is no part of the world but endures through Armageddon, and hence is long-lived. “Tobijah” is pleasing to God because of his faithful devotion to Him; and “Jedaiah” signifies not only that God knows the remnant, but that he cares for and preserves them. The three men named had come from Babylon and evidently had been sent as a delegation by those Jews remaining in Babylon, and had come to observe the work on the temple which had then been resumed. Zechariah was commanded to go into the house of Josiah and there to do certain things to Joshua the high priest and do them in the presence of these three men, which they would later report to their brethren remaining in Babylon. Evidently the house of Josiah was chosen and used because the temple was not then complete. The house was a priest’s house, “founded by Jehovah” (which the name “Josiah” means), and well pictures Jehovah’s priestly house, the remnant, the members of which are now in the secret place of the Lord, hidden and protected by him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> This delegation being gathered into the house of Josiah, Zechariah was directed to “then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest”. (Zech. 6:11) It seems probable that this silver and gold had been collected or contributed by the three men and brought by them, because verse ten says, “Take of them.” The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font3"> of verse eleven agrees with this, reading: “Yea, take of them silver and gold.” The fact of the coming of this delegation of three men years after the original remnant had returned from Babylon, and after the temple work had been resumed, suggests that the three men pictured the same ones as those represented by Esther and Ruth. (See verse 15.) Corresponding to this, members of the faithful remnant class, who are scattered throughout the earth, and therefore are in the world but not of it, come and present themselves unto the Lord and offer their contribution to the work of Jehovah’s King and kingdom, and this was foreshadowed by the use Zechariah made of the silver and gold brought to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Zechariah made “crowns [a crown, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font3"> ” and set it on the head of Joshua the high priest, thus picturing the crown on the head of Christ Jesus. (Ps. 21: 3) The setting was done by Zechariah and suggests that it is the remnant that calls attention to the fact that Christ is crowned king and has come. This the remnant do after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, and particularly after 1922, when they cried out: “The Lord is in his temple; advertise the King and his kingdom!” Now it is seen that Jehovah crowned Jesus in 1914, and the remnant bear witness to that fact, even as Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah on returning bore testimony before those men remaining in Babylon. Jehovah now commands that “all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father”. (John 5:23) This is symbolized by their contributions of silver and gold.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Zechariah was commanded to speak to the high priest and to do so in the presence of and for the benefit of the three men who were there as witnesses and who pictured the remnant now on the earth. ‘ ‘ And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH: and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord,” (Zech. 6:12) At the time Christ the Stone was laid in miniature Pilate said: &quot;Behold the man!” (John 19:5) At the time Christ Jesus the anointed King, the Stone, was laid in completion Jehovah says: &quot;Behold, the man whose name is The BRANCH </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[A.R. V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin, SPROUT].” Jesus Christ is the Sprout or Branch of Jehovah. It was not Zerubbabel of the house of David that was crowned, but Joshua the high priest that was crowned. This proves that David’s natural house was merely typical and that The BRANCH is Jehovah’s direct Offshoot, his Chief Officer and great High Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. It was in 1914 that Jehovah sent forth The BRANCH out of Zion, and which is an insignificant &quot;sprout” in the eyes of the earthly rulers, but he shines in the temple of Jehovah and shall vindicate Jehovah’s name. The words in the prophecy &quot;out of his place” mean ‘out of Zion’, that is to say, Jehovah’s universal organization, from which Christ Jesus is taken and made the Head of the capital organization, and grows up out of the top thereof. (Ezek. 17:22-24) This prophetic picture particularly shows that after the crowning of Jesus as King by Jehovah, and after the casting of Satan out of heaven, he must come to Jehovah’s temple as a crowned King and as High Priest and as Judge of the house of God. Here he brings the faithful into the temple and prepares them to take a part in the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name. These witnesses of Jehovah, pictured by the three men, must bear testimony to others of the world, and that is what they are now doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest prefigured one and the same person, to wit, Christ Jesus, who is ‘‘a priest upon his throne” and fills the office typified by Melchizedek. (Hcb. 7:1) &quot;Even he shall build the temple of the Lord</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">; and</span><span class="font3"> he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” (Zech. 6:13) As builder of the temple he is clothed with majesty, honor and glory, and he bears the commission and the responsibility as the great Vindicator of his Father’s name. &quot;And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house. . . . And he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house. ’ ’ (Isa. 22: 23,24) Ch rist Jesus fills the two offices of king and priest, and there is no conflict between the two; hence it is written: &quot;And the counsel of peace shall be between the two of them.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> The counsel or purpose of both offices is peace. As sacrificing priest he is the way for man to be at peace with God. (Eph. 2:14) He completes the atonement work in heaven as the royal priest; as God’s King he rules and destroys Satan and his organization, which has long been the disturber of the peace, and he will establish 'peace on earth and good will toward men’. He is &quot;King of Salem”, meaning &quot;King of Peace”; &quot;and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, . . . The Prince of Peace.” (Isa. 9: 6, 7) He is the Vindicator and brings everlasting peace by fighting for it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> Zechariah made from the silver and gold contributed a crown for the high priest, and this served as a memorial of the faithfulness and devotion of the contributors. &quot;And the crowns [crown, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font3"> shall be to Helem [another name for Heldai], and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen [another name for Josiah] the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the Lord.” (Zech. 6:14) These men had shown their faithfulness by coming from Babylon to the Lord’s house in &quot;the day of small things”, when the temple was hardly begun. (Hag. 2:3) The Lord shows his appreciation of their devotion and also that of Josiah (Hen), the son of Zephaniah, who allowed his house to be used on this occasion. These men pictured the faithful remnant who share with Christ Jesus in the honor bestowed upon him by Jehovah, and for which faithful ones he reserves &quot;a crown of righteousness”. (2 Tim. 4: 8) And this they receive upon the appearing of the Chief Shepherd. (1 Pet. 5:1-4) They must continue faithful, seeing that no man takes their crown. It is &quot;for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah”, showing that the four men named are honored with recognition in Jehovah’s sanctuary, and shows that the remnant are now gathered together under Christ at the temple and are at the same time heirs of the kingdom and joint-heirs with Christ J esus. This is symbolized by the crown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> The work of these men did not end with their contributions of silver and gold. They had to witness the crowning of Joshua and to hear the words of the prophet, and now it devolved on them to return and bear testimony to others of what they had learned. This shows that the remnant, whom these men foreshadowed, must engage in the witness work, testifying to others, and this after they have received enlightenment; and this is supported by the concluding words of the prophecy, to wit: &quot;And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord; and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.” (Zech. 6:15) Those afar off are the ones taken into the temple after the second outpouring of the holy spirit and to whom those of the temple class give testimony. (Isa. 43: 6, 7; Ps. 147: 2; Matt. 24:31) Those who are thus gathered come and do temple service. These fill up the places of others who might have been of the temple, and who were engaged in the Elijah work, but who were negligent and stumbled over the Stone and have been talking about &quot;character building” since, and have been set aside. There were some at Jerusalem who concluded that it was ‘a time to dwell in ceiled houses and let the temple lie in waste’. (Hag. 1:4) Such foreshadowed the ones who have been obtaining “rest” in what the Lord gave to his people prior to the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, and who have lost the opportunity to have a place of service in the temple; and “they that are far off” have entered now, in their stead, into that blessed privilege of temple service. These latter are particularly pictured by Esther and Ruth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The fact that Jehovah supplied all needed help for the building of the temple in harmony with the prophecy of Zechariah proves that Zechariah was a true prophet sent by the Lord. Jehovah thus vindicated his own word and now vindicates his own witnesses before “Christendom”, and in this manner his witnesses have part in vindicating Jehovah’s name. Jehovah’s witnesses do not need to worry about when and how the many things promised will come to pass. If they are obedient to what the Lord gives them they shall see the fulfilment of Jehovah’s purpose. “If ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God”; meaning that the remnant must now be diligent in doing with their might the work which Jehovah has given them to do, regardless of what others may do. The temple will be completed in due time and Jehovah’s name will be vindicated; but those who are now in the temple are required to render full obedience if they will ultimately participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">HE messenger of the covenant shall suddenly-come </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> his temple.’ Such is the remarkable statement contained in the last book of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Old Testament of the Hebrew Scriptures. What does it mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Has the messenger of the covenant come to his temple, and what connection has that coming with the setting up of the government of God upon earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the progressive steps in the establishment of God’s government of righteousness is the coming of</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>MESSENGER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus to his temple. Solomon, the peaceful and glorious king of Israel and who was a type of Christ, builded a temple unto Jehovah. That temple was built of stones and was typical of the temple of God not made with human hands. Those whom God has anointed, and who prove faithful unto him, constitute his temple which he uses for his purposes. His temple is entirely separate and distinct from Satan’s organization and is no part thereof. “And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.” (2 Cor. 6:16) “For through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father. In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.” —Eph. 2:18,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Head and Chief Corner Stone of the temple of God is Christ Jesus; and his associates are called living stones in the temple. (Isa. 28:16; 1 Pet. 2: 5-8; Heb. 3: 6) Christ Jesus is God’s Messenger and the One whom Jehovah uses to build the spiritual temple. God through his prophet says concerning such: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Mal. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus stated to his followers that after preparing for them he would come again and receive them to himself. (John 14:3) This prophecy of Malachi above quoted shows Christ the Messenger preparing the way and then coming to his temple and that his coming brings great delight to the temple class. One of the titles of Christ Jesus is that of “Bridegroom”; and his associates in his government are designated as the “bride”. Naturally those who would be of the “bride” would delight in the coming of the “Bridegroom”. Paul declared that the appearing of Christ at his temple would be loved by those who will be associated with him in his righteous government. (2 Tim. 4:8) That would mean that all the truly anointed followers of Christ Jesus, who really love him, would rejoice to know of his appearing at the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Frequently Jesus spoke parables concerning the kingdom. A parable is a cryptic statement in the nature of a prophecy to be understood in due time and at its fulfilment. The purpose in speaking parables to his disciples was that the true followers of Christ Jesus would be able to understand them after fulfilment and the understanding would increase the faith and joy of such. Referring to the time of the end of the world, when he would take his power and begin his reign, and after stating what would be proof thereof, Jesus spoke a parable concerning the virgins: “Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.”—Matt. 25:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Ten” is a symbol of completeness or fullness and therefore represents all the virgins. The “ten virgins” therefore represent all those consecrated, spirit-begotten and called. There are two classes here pictured, the wise and the foolish. The “wise” are those who apply their knowledge according to the divine standard and who apply themselves joyfully to the service of the kingdom interests committed to them. To such God’s kingdom is everything, and they make everything in life subservient to that kingdom and its interests. (Prov. 3:35; 13:1; Matt. 6:33) The “foolish” virgins are those who have agreed to do God’s will and who desire the blessing of the Lord and at the same time like to please the world; and because of their selfishness they refrain from a faithful performance of their duties concerning the kingdom interests. For centuries all Christians have been expecting the coming of the Lord according to his promise. These are represented as going out and looking for his coming. The parable represents all the virgins taking their lamps with them. The wise ones took oil in their vessels, but the foolish had no oil. A “lamp” is used in the Scriptures as a symbol of God’s Word of truth, while “oil” is a symbol of joy and gladness. (Ps. 119:105; 23:5; Heb. 1:9) AH Christians have had their Bibles and have studied them some, but only the wise ones have understood and rejoiced in the prospects of the kingdom of God being established. The wise virgins delight in the Bridegroom when he comes to them, and are represented as saying with joy: “Behold, the Bridegroom!” (Matt. 25:6) This parable of the virgins represents the Lord coming to his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time of coming to his temple God purposed should be ascertained by circumstantial evidence, which evidence he has provided. It has pleased God to permit a parallel of circumstances to occur at the first coming of the Lord Jesus and at the time of his second coming. These parallels enable the student to locate the time of fulfilment of prophecy; and this in conjunction with the physical facts makes clear the understanding thereof. It was in A.D. 29 that Jesus was anointed and immediately began his ministry. Three and one-half years thereafter Jesus rode into the city of Jerusalem and offered himself to the Israelites as King and then went immediately to the temple and began to cleanse it. (Matt. 21: 1-13) It was in 1914 that Jesus Christ, as Priest after the order of Melchizedek, stood up in obedience to God’s command and began the work of establishing his kingdom. Just three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in the spring of 1918, Jesus came to his temple and began to cleanse it. The ‘wise virgin’ class shortly thereafter recognized the fulfilment of this prophecy and greatly rejoiced. The facts therefore show that the fulfilment of the parable of the virgins had its beginning with the Lord’s coming to his temple in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of coming to his temple is for judgment, as shown by scriptures. “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.” (Ps. 11:4,5) This judgment must begin with the house of God, that is to say, with those who are followers of Christ. That would mark the time of the fiery trial mentioned by the prophet Malachi. (Mal. 3; 2, 3) Paul describes it as a time when every man’s work shall be tried by fire. (1 Cor. 3:12-15) It is also marked as a time of separation of those who are truly devoted to the Lord from those who are only partially devoted to him.—Matt. 13:24-30,37-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The facts show that in fulfilment of this prophetic utterance a great trial came upon God’s people, beginning in the spring of 1918, and at that time many were persecuted; and some stood faithful, while many fell away. It was really a test of devotion to the Lord God. Since that time the cleansing of the temple has continued and many have fallen away, while others have entered to take their place and have stood fast. Those who have been faithful have rejoiced greatly in the experiences that God has permitted to come to them. This cleansing of the temple class, meaning the ones truly devoted to the Lord, is again pictured by the prophet Isaiah. (Isa. 6:1-9) It was in fulfilment of this prophecy that the truly devoted ones of the Lord awakened to their privileges shortly after 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then followed the judgment of all the professed organizations called “Christian”. The World War and attending conditions furnished ample proof to all who studied the Scriptures that the time for the establishment of God’s government had come. Many clergymen saw it and admitted the truth thereof. The pressure, however, was too great for them. They were too anxious to shine. They were like their prototype, the Pharisees. They wanted the kingdom to be established with outward show, so that they could be in the limelight. To this end they rushed before the Lord, and allied themselves with the Devil’s organization named the League of Nations, and called it the representation of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Out of this trying experience that began and progressed in 1918 came the ‘wise virgin’ class, which means those who are loyal and faithful to the Lord, and who rejoiced in whatsoever circumstances the Lord permitted to be around them and in the trials that came to them. In the dark hour of night, represented by midnight, they recognized the Bridegroom and eried out: “Behold, the Bridegroom!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another proof of the progressive steps in connection with the setting up of the Lord’s kingdom is shown by the parables of the pounds and talents uttered by Jesus to his disciples. In the parable of the pounds Jesus represents himself as “a certain nobleman [going} into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom [or government], and to return”. Before leaving he commits to his ten servants ten pounds, directing them to use wisely these pounds until his return. “Ten” is a symbol of completeness; therefore the “ten servants” represented all the called ones of God, and the “ten pounds” represented all the interests of the kingdom or government committed to all the servants during the absence of the Lord Jesus. He returns to take account with all his servants; and this represents his coming to his temple in 1918. The parable shows that some would prove faithful, and some unfaithful. The faithful ones would be looking well to the interests of the kingdom committed to them and be faithfully representing the Lord; while others would be indifferent or negligent. When he comes to take account with them he rewards the faithful and fitly recompenses the unfaithful. The chief part of the parable is to show the Lord’s taking an account or examining his servants when he comes to his temple and determining who have been faithful and who otherwise.—Luke 19:12-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus spoke anothex <sub>r</sub>„. relating to the same thing and also proving that 1918 marks the time of coming to his temple, “b'or the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.” —Matt. 25:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this parable “his goods” represent kingdom or government interests, and would be the same thing as represented by the “pounds” in the other parable just mentioned. In that parable the kingdom interests were also represented by the “talents”. In the parable of the “pounds” all the kingdom interests were committed to all his servants collectively; whereas in the parable of the “talents” the kingdom interests are shown as committed individually to the various ones of the anointed, and committed to each “according to his several ability”. As used in that scripture the term “ability” means the measure of loyalty and faithful devotion to God, which is determined by the measure of the spirit of the Lord. The more one increases in the spirit of the Lord, the more his ability increases and the more faithfully he represents the Lord’s interests. The kingdom interests, represented in the parable by “hi</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">s goo</span><span class="font3">ds” and by his “talents”, plus the spirit of Christ or loving devotion, represented by “ability”, furnish opportunities to prove the Christian’s loyalty and faithfulness unto the Lord. When the Lord returns and takes account he does not reward anyone because of profit that he has brought to God. No man could bring any profit unto the Lord, regardless of what he does. (Luke 17:10) The reward is given to his followers omy Decause of faithfulness. To those whom he finds faithfully representing him he says: “Well done, good and faithful sen-ant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou [now] into the joy of thy lord.” (Matt. 25:23) This shows that the faithful or approved ones would enter into the joy of the Lord while they are still on the earth and that this is given to them because of their unselfish devotion to the Lord’s interests. The parable shows that the unfaithful ones have all their talents, namely, their interests in connection with the kingdom, taken away from them and given to those who have been faithful.—Matt. 25: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These parables show how the Lord measures all who hive made a covenant to do God’s will and by that measurement determines who constitute the temple class or faithful members of Christ on earth. (Rev. 11:1) This is a work that must be done by the Lord at the time of coming to his temple. Those whom the Lord finds to be faithfully devoted to him, and who are making the kingdom interests paramount to everything else, he approves; and all such collectively he designates that “faithful and wise servant”, and from that time forward the Lord commits to that “faithful and wise servant” all of his goods, namely, all of his kingdom interests on earth. Concerning such it is written: “Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” (Matt. 24:45-47) In contrast therewith the Scriptures mention an “evil servant” class, which is made up of the ones disapproved by the Lord because they have not shown a proper appreciation of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The parable of the “virgins”, of the “pounds”, and of the “talents”, and the manifestation of the “faithful and wise servant”, all have a fulfilment at the time the Lord comes to his temple. These represent a work of examination, testing and separating of the faithful from the unfaithful in the progressive steps of setting up the government of righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>JEHOVAH’S SERVANT JOB</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">H</span><span class="font3">IDDEN from the understanding of all who have read its strange but fascinating lines, the book of Job, one of the oldest portions of the Bible, now appears in its true setting as the revelation of a part of the sublime purpose of Jehovah, the living God. To the suffering and perplexed peoples of earth its message brings a beam of light that is at once comforting and refreshing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the greatest moving-picture producer. He permits men to make some pictures, and as a result of their efforts they think they are great. They are not. Beginning in the early days of man Jehovah used men to move according to his perfect purpose, and by their movements he pictured the coming days of salvation and restoration to life. Of course those men, although anxious to know the meaning of their course of action, did not understand the meaning thereof, because it was not the will of God nor his due time for them to understand. Many of those men thus used had faith in God, and their faith he will in due time reward. Even the angels of heaven desired to understand, but God reserved the understanding thereof to those who should live on earth at his appointed time and who are devoted to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font3">ong the great pictures made and set down in the Bible is that of the case of Job. In fact, it stands out separate and distinct, teaching lessons of greatest importance to creation. The book that bears Job’s name has been little understood, as indeed it could not be understood until God’s due time. Viewed now in the light of fulfilled prophecy and of the revealed purpose of God, the book of Job begins to unfold to the diligent searcher after truth. The very language employed in the book gives a clear picture of God’s power to give life to mankind by means of restitution, and also of his purpose and provision so to do. The restitution picture applies not only to Jews, but to all peoples of the earth. So far as the Scriptures disclose, Job was not a Jew. He lived outside of the land of Israel. He dwelt in Uz, which is east of Palestine. Concerning Job it is written: “This man was the greatest of all the men of the east.” (Job 1: 3) This places Job in a class all by himself and indicates that the picture God used him to make must be a distinctive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That which is written concerning Job takes on greater interest when we begin to see that God used him to make a marvelous picture of restitution as a means of bringing life to the human race. Uz was a descendant of Shem through Aram. It therefore follows that Job was a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah, and upon which son God pronounced special blessings. (Gen. 9: 26; 10: 23) “Uz” means “counsel” or “consultation”, which seems to indicate that Uz and his descendants were those who sought counsel or knowledge of Jehovah God. That seems to show that Job had relationship with God and that God used him for a specific purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A picture is an image of the real substance. The image may be one that is seen by the natural eye, or it may be a mental representation of that which is tangible. Whether Job existed as a real person or whether the statement concerning him is an allegory matters not. The account is written in the Word of God and is intended for the instruction of mankind. Since the Bible abounds with proof that God used men to make living pictures concerning the development of his purpose of salvation, the proof is overwhelming that Job was a real man and was used to make a living picture, and that he had communication or relationship with God. Furthermore the proof is quite conclusive that Job lived some time after the days of Abraham. That he did really exist, and that the story is not an allegory, is supported by the testimony of other prophets.—Ezek. 14:14,20; Jas. 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a striking correspondency of Job with Adam that cannot be ignored. The difference was that Adam did not maintain his integrity, while Job did maintain his integrity. Adam, the perfect man, was a prince and dwelt in the garden of God which was planted eastward in Eden, and Adam had communication or counsel with God. Job was “the greatest of all the men of the east”, which constituted him a prince among men. He is spoken of in the Scriptures as a prince. (Job 21:28; 31:37) He lived in the land of Uz, the meaning of which is that he had communication or counsel with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God made the man Adam perfect, and it was the will of the Creator that this perfect creature should worship God. It was the work of the Devil to turn the man Adam away from God. The Devil took that course of action for selfish reasons. Jehovah did not hedge Adam about so as to make him invulnerable to the wiles of Lucifer. God permitted Adam to be subjected to temptation to prove him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Job it is written: “That man was perfect and upright, and one- that feared God, and eschewed evil.” Even though he was imperfect in his organism and had no right to life, his heart was pure toward God and therefore God counted him perfect. Since God looks upon the heart or motive that induces man to act, he judged him from that viewpoint. “The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7) Job’s heart was soft toward God and he feared God with a proper or godly fear. (Job 23:15-17) Job therefore stood before God as though he were a perfect man, being upright and pure in heart. Adam was actually perfect in Eden; so Job was counted perfect, and therefore there was a correspondency in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prince Adam was a wealthy man. He had a wife whom God had given him, and he had the prospect of filling the earth with a happy and perfect race of sons and daughters. He was the father of the human family. He was given dominion over every living creature, of the beasts and fowls of earth.—Gen. 1:26; 2:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In his time Job was chief among men. (Job 29:25) His wealth and position among men was one of the reasons why he was the greatest of all men of the east. God uses symbols in connection with the pictures he has made. The number ten is a symbolic number representing completeness, that is to say, including all. Any multiple of ten would therefore symbolize the same thing. In this connection it is interesting and important to note the wealth that Job possessed, and it shows a correspondency to that of Prince Adam. Job had seven sons and three daughters, making a total of ten children. This total number of his children would well represent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> the offspring of Adam, or, otherwise stated, all the human family. Job possessed seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He also possessed five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses, and a very great household. (Job 1:3) It is thus seen that his position among men and his great wealth constituted him the greatest man of his time. In his restitution Job was given all that he had lost and much more; and this is further proof that God used Job to make a living picture representing the course of man and how man would be granted life by means of redemption and restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Adam should have been wholly devoted to God because that was his duty as a perfect creature. Job was wholly devoted to God as a matter of choice. His sons made a feast, and all these sons together with their sisters partook of that feast. The devotion of-Job to Jehovah is proved by what immediately followed that feast: “And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.” (Job 1:5) The fact that Job did so “all the days” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(margin),</span><span class="font3"> or “continually”, is further proof of his devotion to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lucifer was the overlord of Adam during his sojourn in Eden. Jehovah God appointed him to that position. Because of Lucifer’s disloyalty and rebellion God changed his name to that of Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil. The lordship over man was not taken away from the Devil, however, and as the Devil he has continued to exercise power over men. The proof of this is given in the book of Job, as well as in other portions of the Scriptures. That which caused the fall of Lucifer and turned him into a devil was his coveting the devotion of Adam to God. Lucifer wanted that worship of man for himself. To accomplish his wicked purpose he worked through Eve, the woman whom God had given to Adam; and he succeeded in his wicked purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil begrudged the worship and devotion that Job was giving to the Lord. The Devil accused Job of serving God for a selfish reason. The day came when the sons of God presented themselves before the Lord Jehovah. Satan the Devil also appeared with that heavenly company. This is proof that Satan was in heaven and had access to the presence of Jehovah God. Satan desired to turn Job away from God; and God, knowing this, offered him the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou ? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought ? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.” (Job 1:7-12) However, Satan’s charges proved false.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>INFORMATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Since the going into effect of the National Industrial Recovery Act a number of subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> have written this office and asked that Brother Rutherford give advice as to what they should do. A copy of his letter appears below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">August 2, 1933 Deab Brother:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Responding to your inquiry concerning the National Industrial Recovery Act, I answer, first, that this act and its provisions has no relationship whatsoever to Revelation 13:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This act of Congress is in no wise religious. Regardless of what any one’s opinion might be as to the success of the act in recovering business conditions, that is no reason why it should be resisted. It is not in opposition to the principles laid down in the Lord’s Word. It does not violate any law of God. Joining oneself in an agreement such as is required by the law does not require one to go about making speeches for it.—Matt. 23:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Manifestly the purpose of the act is to aid, so far as it is possible, more persons to get employment so that they can earn their daily bread. There could be no real objection to any honest effort that is put forth to help the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While we are certain the Lord’s kingdom is the only relief'for the human race, the rulers of this world do not see that at the present time, and hence we must give them credit for doing what they deem to be the best to help the people. All business and industry for a long while has submitted and must submit to government codes concerning fire prevention, the operation of factories, the licensing of motor cars, compensation for injuries, industrial insurance, and various things, of that kind; and the National Recovery Act comes exactly in that same class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle, under inspiration of the Lord, wrote, in Romans 13: 6, ‘<sup>1</sup> For this cause pay ye tribute [taxes].” The taxes paid by the people will go, at least part thereof, to the operation of the National Recovery Act. This act is in no respect whatsoever made or intended to support any church system or church organization, but is a general provision for governing the business operation of the country. We might be reminded that in Egypt, when God’s chosen people were there, they were required to dig for water the same as the Egyptians were required to dig.—Ex. 7:24,25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The National Recovery Act does not in any way violate God’s law. It is a general provision looking to the betterment of economic conditions. I feel sure that this National Recovery Act will never accomplish what its framers hope will be accomplished, for the reason that the Scriptures show that the Devil is making all the trouble he can for the human family and will continue to do so until Jehovah destroys his organization and puts in operation the righteous kingdom under Christ. (Rev. 12:12) If you are engaged in business, then you must adapt yourself to business methods which are required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that one is required to put a sign in his window is in no way a violation of any Scriptural provision. That is merely a notice to the public that you are trying to do your part, and is in no wise a violation of your obligation to the Lord. I hope that this covers the matter. There may be some codes made by classes of business that seem unreasonable, but I am writing you now with reference to the provisions of the National Recovery Aet itself which I have before me, and I could not answer you as to any codes about which I know nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be assured of my love and best wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and servant by His grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH UNFOLDING HIS PROPHECIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I finished the last article on the cleansing of the sanctuary a short time ago and want to tell you that I got a great blessing out of the study. There is no question that you have the correct understanding of this matter, and it should be a source of great encouragement to the friends to know that Jehovah God made such a detailed record of these matters so long ago and is now graciously unfolding them to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Quite a number of the brethren I have discussed the article with recently were all impressed with the explanation of ‘‘transgression of desolation”, an entirely new thought to them and absolutely in harmony with Romans 7: 7. Seeing the difference between the transgression of desolation, and the abomination of desolation was quite interesting and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently I visited several companies that have difficulty, and I can truthfully say that in every one of them the whole trouble is due to the fact that they do not appreciate the resolution published in the October 15 (1932) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Any company that does not recognize the Society as the visible part of Jehovah’s organization is having more or less difficulty. I have tried to the best of my ability to bring these matters to their attention. In some places I may have had some success, but, I fear, in others, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With, much Christian love and best wishes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother in the service of Jehovah,</span></p>

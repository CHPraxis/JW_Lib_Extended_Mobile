<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Sending Forth the Truth unto the Clouds</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘God shall send foi’th his mercy and his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font9">UDGE RUTHERFORD’S lecture, October 1, 1933, entitled “The True God”, broadcast on 104 stations, thoroughly covered the entire United States, from Maine to California and from Florida to the state of Washington. Only 8 of the 48 states were not directly represented in the chain; several of these are small or sparsely settled, and all were covered thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is really true that God is now sending forth His mercy and His truth, and none can say Him nay. It is really true that God’s mercy toward those who really wish to honor His name is great unto the heavens, and it is because of that mercy that the truth regarding the Fountain of all mercies still rises unto the clouds, to the dismay of all His adversaries. The broadcast of October 1 was a triumph over the enemy in an hour when he was looking for exactly opposite results. We review the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Judge Rutherford’s broadcast last spring on “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity” angered the Devil greatly, as did also the published challenge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“RESOLVED, That the Holy Scriptures prove beyond doubt that the head of the papal church system and its many priests who act officially under its direction do not act by the authority of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and do not represent God and Christ on earth, but said Catholic institution is a part of this world and operates under the supervision of the god of this world, that is to say, Satan, the Devil, and that thereby the people are deceived and kept in ignorance of the truth, which truth is now vital for them to know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unable to make defense of their doctrines, and not daring to publicly debate the above question, all the power of the Roman Catholic system in America was suddenly put to work to force Judge Rutherford off the air, and we had an exhibition of Roman Catholic bigotry in</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">truth unto the clouds.”—Psalm 57: 3</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">For thv mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy ,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">this country that is enough to make any decent American hang his head for shame to think that a thing like it could be done in this enlightened day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How the Devil Operates</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The heaviest pressure was brought to bear in New England, where the city of Providence cringes under the lash of a bigoted bishop. In that city two station managements broke their contracts and gave up their manhood and independence, because covertly threatened with a boycott which it was hinted would include 400,-000 Catholics. The owners of these stations had other businesses which they foolishly believed would be ruined unless they complied with the threats. The Providence </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Visitor</span><span class="font9"> was the paper used as the “bludgeon”. Had the men who owned these stations stood their ground, nothing such as they anticipated would have occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A similar campaign of intimidation was put on in St. Paul, where </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font9"> was the “thumb-screw” used and the radio people were bluffed into believing that “some 515,000 Catholic people in the state of Minnesota” would turn against them and against their advertisers unless they showed the white feather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In St. Louis the bludgeoning was entrusted to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchman.</span><span class="font9"> This sheet, after an exhibition of bigotry unmatched in this part of the world, had the hypocrisy to say, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchman</span><span class="font9"> wishes to thank the officers of KMOX in the name of its readers for this step [refusing to broadcast Judge Rutherford’s lectures] in the work of preventing the spread of bigotry.” Most bigoted of all institutions under the sun, the Roman Catholic system takes the position that any questioning of its doctrines by others is an act of bigotry. Needless to say, this very doctrine itself is bigotry of the worst kind.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">In Baltimore the sheet entrusted with the work of bigotry, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Review,</span><span class="font9"> failed completely in its attempt to force two stations (one owned and operated by Roman Catholics) to give up the broadcasts of Judge Rutherford’s lectures. After writing several columns of lurid editorials </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Review</span><span class="font9"> was finally forced to shamefacedly admit in print that “this week </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Review</span><span class="font9"> has received just one letter of protest against Rutherford's address. Just one protest! And </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Review</span><span class="font9"> is read by 125,(100 Catholics.’’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Blessing of Jehovah God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">It is true that by resorting to methods peculiarly un-American the Roman Catholic hierarchy, operating through its papers, was able to frighten 28 stations into temporarily discontinuing the Rutherford broadcasts, but more than offsetting this is the fact that thirty stations desired to get into the network for October 1-8-15 that could not be accommodated, and numerous other stations were anxious to take the broadcasts except for the. fact that local church organizations that had previously engaged the required periods positively refused to stand aside for these vitally important messages, even though station managers were entirely willing to give them other time in their schedules on the day of the chain broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The big coast-to-coast hook-up of 104 stations was made entirely without aid of the so-called “regular” chain broadcasting systems. The Watch Tower organization made its own arrangements, as is its custom. Jehovah’s blessing was manifestly upon the efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a very special sense it was fulfilled on October 1 that God’s truth reached unto the clouds. Indeed, while we may not know of it, it is entirely possible that on that day not merely one but many persons that were sailing along in airplanes beneath the clouds or even above them, were listening to Judge Rutherford's lecture on “The True God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who heard Judge Rutherford's address on “The True God” were charmed by its kindness, its goodness and its truth. It seems right to spend a moment thinking of how God identifies himself with truth, and especially the most important of all truths, those about himself. “This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Moses delighted to refer to Jehovah as “a God of truth”. (Deuteronomy 32: 4) David said that “all the paths of [Jehovah] are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies” (Psalm 25:10); that He is a God “plenteous in mercy and truth” (Psalm 86:15) ; that “the truth of [Jehovah] endureth for ever” (Psalm 117:2); and then, as stated in the text at the head of this article, and elsewhere stated in the psalms, “Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.”—Psalm 108: 4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>God’s Watchcare over His Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">“God shall send forth . . . his truth.” He will give it His own attention. What must be the futility of all efforts to impede what He has declared shall go forward! How chagrined the Devil must feel when he reflects on the fact that in the United States (and possessions) there are now on the air each week, with transcriptions, 2G1 stations laden with essential, all-important information about The True God! Throughout the world the stations broadcasting the truth number more than three hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some stations were so disappointed at not being included in the coast-to-coast network of October 1-8-15 that they expressed their keen regret by wire. Some of these will be accommodated, of course, on future programs. A great station that believes that its broadcasts reach 2,000,000 listeners in a district embracing Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri, wrote, “We feel very keenly the loss of your three great programs which will be broadcast on October 1, 8 and 15. It is doubly regrettable because all that stood between us and the acceptance of your offer was your return of our station form as requested in our wire. We don’t know whether you or ourselves are to blame for this grievous loss to our audience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Kouiier,</span><span class="font9"> published at Atlanta by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in its issue of September, 1933, said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Roman Catholic newspapers the country over have broken out in a rash of criticism of what they term anti-Catholic radio programs. They are in particular begging the Federal Radio Commission to place a ban on Judge Joseph F. Rutherford’s ‘Watchtower’ programs. . . . The Catholic attack on the Rutherford programs is one of the hottest they have launched on any Protestant project recently. Some spineless stations have already eliminated the feature to which the Catholics object, while others, with more backbone, have told their Catholic critics to go stick their heads in a bucket of holy water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Brief Answer to a Long Article</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HE </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Ballet!,</span><span class="font9">in its issue of August 18, 1933, devotes six columns to what purports to be an open letter to Judge Rutherford. It is written on such a low plane as not to justify much space in our columns. The priest who wrote it misstates the facts, missapplies the Scriptures, uses some of the prophecies in an effort to support his wrongful position, and then tries to answer the proper application of other prophecies to himself and other priests by saying that the prophets have been dead since 600 B.C., thus showing his deliberate purpose to deceive Catholics. At one time we thought to answer the whole article, but later thought it not worth while to devote so much space to it. From the original draft we cite two paragraphs from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font9"> (Cleveland), with our replies thereto :</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Rome Addresses Her Followers as Apostates</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">O ye listeners to this false prophet, remember, he deceived you once, and the Lord etics out, &quot;Woe to you, apostate children, that you would Take counsel and not of me.” (Isaiah 30:1) No matter how he pleads with you, ‘‘Consent not to him. hear him not.” (Deuteronomy 13:8) He is blind and the leader of the blind and till who follow shall fall into the ditch. (Matthew 15: 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems to us a peculiarly appropriate thing that a Roman Catholic writer should address his fellow Catholics as &quot;apostate children”, for it is very true that they have all apostatized from the true faith, and instead of taking counsel of Jehovah God, and drinking at His fountain of pure truth, the Scriptures, they have fed on the effluvia of papal bulls until they are sick unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The text Deuteronomy 13: 8, 9 was addressed to the Jews, who were being enticed by another to worship wicked ones in violation of Exodus 20: 2-5. We are glad that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe Bulletin</span><span class="font9"> made use of this citation and applied it to Judge Rutherford, for now it shows how a misunderstanding of the Scriptures may make murderers out of people that are thus misled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The text in full reads as follows in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Douai), </span><span class="font9">and shows just why the Roman Catholic officials at Plainfield wanted to kill Judge Rutherford, and half felt as if they had a commission to do it, in spite of the laws of the land to the contrary; and why it is a dangerous thing to have a bigoted Catholic in any official position, or even as a neighbor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘Consent not to him, hear him not, neither let thy eye spare him to pity and conceal him, but thou shalt presently put him to death. Let thy hand be first upon him, and afterwards the hands of all the people. With stones shall he be stoned to death.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Matthew 15:14 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(Douaif)</span><span class="font9"> Jesus is speaking about the unfaithfulness of the scribes and Pharisees, the clergy of that day, who represented the similarly unfaithful clergy of our own time. Concerning all of these he said: &quot;Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind leacl the blind, both fall into the pit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Blindest of all the blind leaders of the blind is the ‘pope’. Not discerning that the governments of this world belong to the Devil (Luke 4: 5-7) the ‘pope’ has done the exact opposite of what Jesus did when confronted with the same temptation, i.e., the offer of temporal power as a ruler of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus said, &quot;Get thee behind me, Satan”; but the ‘pope’ in effect said, &quot;Thou art my father and I am thy child,” and threw himself headlong into his arms, accepting from earthly monarchs the little kingdom of Vatican City, over which he now reigns as a potentate. Now, when Satan’s reign has ended, and his governments are in distress, the ‘pope’ and all who cling to him are booked for a one-way ride to the ash-can.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Temple of Jehovah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;And now at the temple of Jehovah Christ pronounces”— Strange no one hears Christ except the ventriloquistie judge. And what and where is this &quot;temple of Jehovah”? Why dear bless your innocent heart, there ain’t no such temple “at anywhere”. According to tlie judge, &quot;The temple is Christ’s righteous organization,” of which, we suspect, the judge is the visible head, the acting pope, the busy leader, etc., and which you can join for fifty-five cents and more or less faith in Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God's temple, or dwelling place, is His organization for the vindication of His name, composed of Jesus Christ, the Chief Foundation Stone, the Vindicator, and the 144,000 members of His corporate body, The Christ. (Apocalypse 7:3-8; 14:1) This temple, this Servant, was brought together in the first resurrection in the spring of the year 1918, at which time the sleeping members of The Christ were awakened, and the judgment of the living members began. Jehovah's witnesses is another name for the col-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’•It was probably a misunderstanding of this scripture that caused a Scranton citizen recently to hit the editor in the face with his list. At the time he did this he loudly shouted that we were circulating bigotry. The poor sap! The only violence ever vi-dted upon Jehovah's witnesses is by Roman Catholics, whose whole training is that of the bigot and persecutor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">lective Servant whom Jesus, “The man whose name is The Branch,” began to gather together into a compact organization immediately after the Foundation Stone was laid in Zion in 1918. Jesus was made Jehovah's King in 1914, and the text Zechariah 6:12,13 says that He shall build the temple of the Lord at the time He is made king. In Revelation 11:17,18 we are told that when Christ takes His power and begins His reign it is coincident with a world war and that then, and not until then, the temple of God is opened in the heavens. We have condensed this all it will bear, but it is all true. Nobody is under any compulsion to accept this great truth, or to receive the blessings that follow its understanding and acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Roman “church” is especially avaricious and especially shameless. None of the prisoners of this system can be born, get christened, get confirmed, go to church, get married, have a baby, or even turn over on their back and die, without being hounded for money at every step of the way. Wherever men or women are paid for their services, there the black-robed messengers of avarice stand with outstretched hands, looking for a rake-off to stow away under their maternity gowns. They never travel alone. They do not dare. They travel in pairs, so that if one should squeal as to where all the foundlings come from, the other will be there to report it to the jailer when they get back to their prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of this vicious system of racketeering the politics of American cities are so rotten that things are fairly falling apart. Surely this system is a fine specimen to accuse Judge Rutherford of covetousness. A silent virgin is an unanswerable reproach to a loud-mouthed harlot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Federal Reserve Swindle</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HE clergy tell the unsuspecting and gullible citizens that the United States of America is a Christian nation and that it is operated according to the will of God, but they fail to tell the people which god. Every person who believes in the Bible knows that the all-wise, just and loving Jehovah God and Christ Jesus would not approve of any government that swindles the people or permits them to be swindled by heartless corporations. Satan is the god of this world and the oppressor of humankind. The clergy, big business and professional politicians stand together, and the people hold the bag, which is usually empty, especially at this time. The following taken from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record </span><span class="font9">speaks for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The compilation from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font9"> is from addresses of Hon. Louis T. McFadden, so highly respected in his own state of Pennsylvania that he was nominated for Congress by all three parties, republican, democratic and prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Government is in the banking business as never before. Against its will it has been made the backer of horsethieves and card sharps, bootleggers, smugglers, speculators, and swindlers in all parts of the world. Through the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks the riffraff of every country is operating on the public credit of the United States Government. Meanwhile, and on account of it, we ourselves are in the midst of the greatest depression we have ever known. Thus the menace to our prosperity, so feared by Senator Lodge, has indeed struck home. From the Atlantic to the Pacific our country has been ravaged and laid waste by the evil practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks and the interests which control them. At no time in our history has the general welfare of the people of the United States been at a lower level or the mind of the people so filled with despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, while the Federal Reserve bill was under discussion, Mr. Crozier, of Cincinnati, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other words, the imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by these central corporations owned by the banks. This is a life and death power over ail local banks and all business. It can be used to create or destroy prosperity, to ward oft' or cause stringencies and panics. By making money artificially scarce interest rates throughout the country can be titbitrarily raised and the bank tax on all business and cost of living increased for the profit of the banks owning ihe-e regional central banks, and without the slightest benefit to the people. These 12 corporations together cover the whole country and monopolize and use for private gain every dollar of the public currency and all public revenues of the I'niled Slates. Not a dollar can be put into circulation among the people by their Government without the consent of and on terms fixed by these 12 private money trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In defiance of this and all other warnings, the proponents of the Federal Reserve Act created the 12 private credit corporations and gave them an absolute monopoly of the currency of the United States, not of Federal Reserve notes alone, but of all the currency, the Federal Reserve Act providing ways by means of which the gold and general currency in the hands of the American people could be obtained by the Federal Reserve banks in exchange for Federal Reserve notes, which are not money but merely promises to pay money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I believe that the nations of the world would have settled down after the World War more peacefully if we had not had this standing temptation here—this pool of our bank depositors’ money given to private interests and used by them in connection with illimitable drafts upon the public credit of the United States Government. The Federal Reserve Board invited the world to come in and to carry away cash, credit, goods, and everything else of value that was movable. Values amounting to many billions of dollars have been taken out of this country by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks for the benefit of their foreign principals. The United States has been ransacked and pillaged. Our structures have been gutted and only the walls are left standing. While this crime was being perpetrated everything the world could rake up to sell us was brought in here at our own expense by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks until our markets were swamped with unnceded and unwanted imported goods priced far above their value and thus made to equal the dollar volume of our honest exports and to kill or reduce our favorable balance of trade. As agents of the foreign central banks, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks try by every means within their power to reduce our favorable balance of trade. They act for their foreign principals, and they accept fees from foreigners for acting against the best interests of the United States. Naturally there has been great competition among foreigners for the favors of the Federal Reserve Board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Air. Chairman, I believe that the national-bank depositors of the United States are entitled to know what the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks are doing with their money. There are millions of national-bank depositors in this country who do not know that a percentage of every dollar they deposit in a member bank of the Federal Reserve system goes automatically to the American agents of foreign banks and that all of their deposits can be paid away to foreigners without their knowledge or consent by the crooked machinery of the Federal Reserve act and the questionable practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. Air. Chairman, the American people should be told the truth by their servants in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1928, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks presented the staggering amount of $60,598,690,000 to their member banks at the expense of 1he wage earners and taxpayers of the United States. In 1929, the year of the stock market crash, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks advanced fifty-eight billions to member banks. In 1930, while the speculating banks were getting out of the stock market at the expense of the general public, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks advanced them $13,022,782,000. This shows that when 1he banks were gambling on the public credit of the United States Government as represented by Federal Reserve currency, they were subsidized to any amount they required by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. When the swindle began to fail, the banks knew it in advance and withdrew from the market. They got out with whole skins and left the people of the United States to pay the piper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will take us 20 years to redeem our Government, 20 years of penal servitude to pay off the gambling debts of the traitorous Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks and to earn again that vast flood of American wages and savings, bank deposits, and United States Government credit which the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks exported out of this country to their foreign principals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every effort has been made by the Federal Reserve Board to conceal its power but the truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States. It controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will. No man and no body of men is more entrenched in power than the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. These evil-doers have robbed this country of more than enough money to pay the national debt. What the National Government has permitted the Federal Reserve Board to steal from the people should now be restored to the people. The people have a valid claim against the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. If that claim is enforced, Americans will not need to stand in breadlines or to suffer and die of starvation in the streets. Homes will be saved, families will be kept together and American children will not be dispersed and abandoned. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks owe the United States Government an immense sum of money. We ought to find out the exact amount of the people’s claim. We should know the amount of the indebtedness of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks to the people and we should collect that amount immediately. We certainly should investigate this treacherous and disloyal conduct of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wealth of the United States and the working capital of the United States has been taken away from them and has either been locked in the vaults of certain banks and great corporations or exported to foreign countries for the benefit of the foreign customers of those banks and corporations. So far as the people of the United States arc concerned, the cupboard is bare. It is true that the warehouses and coal yards and grain elevators are full, but the warehouses and coal yards and grain elevators are padlocked and the great banks and corporations hold the keys. The saek of the United States by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks and their confederates is the greatest crime in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Chairman, the bank holidays in the several States were brought about by the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. Those institutions manipulated money and credit and caused the St:ites to order bank holidays. Those holidays were ‘’frame-ups'’. They were dress rehearsals for the national-bank holiday which Franklin D. Roosevelt promised Sir Ronald Lindsay that he would declare. There was no national emergency here when Roosevelt took office except the bankruptcy of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks—a bankruptcy which Ims been going on under cover for several years and which has been concealed from the people so that the people would continue to permit their bank deposits and their bank reserves and their gold and the funds of the United States Treasury to be impounded in the bankrupt institutions. Under cover, the predatory international bankers have been stealthily transferring the burden of the Federal Reserve debts to the people’s Treasury and to the people themselves. They have been using the farms and the homes of the United States to pay for their thievery. That is the only national emergency there has been here since the depression began. Someone asked Mr. Ogden Mills what caused the depression. lie answered quite truthfully, “The Federal Reserve lent so much money abroad that it broke down the system.” Mr. Chairman, those who have lost everything they possessed through the evil practices of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks should at least be told the truth about how it happened. The veterans of the World War should know that the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks paid the dole in England, and are still paying il, and that that is the reason why the resident agents of England in this country have cut the pensions of the United States soldiers $400,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At noon on the 4th of March 1933 Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with his hand on the Bible, took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. At midnight on the 5th of March 1933 he confiscated the property of American citizens. He took the currency of the United States off the gold standard of value. He repudiated the internal debt of the Government to its own citizens. He destroyed the value of the American dollar. He released, or endeavored to release, the Federal Reserve banks from their contractual liability to redeem Federal Reserve currency in gold or lawful money on a parity with gold. He depreciated the value of the national currency. The people of the United States are now using irredeemable paper slips for ircney. The Treasury cannot redeem that paper in gold or silver. The gold and silver of the Treasury has unlawfully been given to the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. And the administration has since had the effrontery to raid the country for more gold for the private interests by telling our patriotic citizens that their gold is needed to protect the currency. It is not being used to protect the currency. It is being used to protect the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. The directors of those institutions have committed criminal offenses against the United States Government, including the offense of making false entries on their books and the still more serious offense of unlawfully abstracting funds from the United States Treasury. Roosevelt's gold raid is intended to help them out of the pit they dug for themselves when they gambled away the wealth and savings of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Roosevelt's next haul for the international bankers was a reduction in the pay of all Federal employees. The poor clerk in a Government office is compelled to give up 15 percent of his salary while the international bankers are presented with all the gold in the country. Next in order are the veterans of all wars, many of whom are aged and infirm and others sick and disabled. Those men had their lives adjusted for them by acts of Congress determining the amount of their pensions, and, while it is meet that every citizen should sacrifice himself for the good of the United States, I see no reason why these poor people, these aged Civil War veterans, mid war widows, and half-starved veterans of tiie World War should be compelled to give up their pensions for the financial benefit of the international vultures who have looted the Treasury, bankrupted the country, and traitorously delivered the United States to a foreign foe. There are many ways or raising revenue that are better than this barbarous act of injustice. Why not collect from the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks the amount they owe to the United States Treasury in interest on all the Federal Reserve currency they have taken from the United States Government ? That would put billions of dollars into the United States Treasury. If Franklin D. Roosevelt is as honest as he pretends to be he will have that done immediately. And. in addition, why not compel the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks to disclose their profits and to pay the Government its share? Until that is done, it is rank dishonesty to talk of maintaining the credit of the United States Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before he was elected Mr. Roosevelt advocated a return to the earlier practices of the Federal Reserve system, thus admitting its corruptness. The Democratic platform advocated a change in the personnel of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks. Those remarks were campaign bait. As a prominent democrat lately remarked to me, and he is not very far away from where I am standing at the present moment, ‘‘There is no new deal. The same old crowd is in control.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Chairman, wo know from assertions made here by the Honorable John N. Garner, the present Vice President of the United States, that there is a condition in the United Stales Treasury which would cause American citizens, if they knew what it was, to lose all confidence in their Government. That is a condition which Roosevelt will not have investigated, lie has brought with him from Wall Street, James Warburg, the son of Paul M. Warburg. Air. Warburg is 1lie head of the Bank of f.lanhattan Co. Mr. Warburg, alien born and the son of an alien who did not become naturalized here until several years after this Warburg's birth, is a son of a former partner of Kuhn, Loeb &amp;&nbsp;Co., a grandson of another partner, a nephew of a former partner, and a nephew of a present partner. He holds no office in our Government, but I am told that he is in daily attendance at the Treasury, and that he has private quarters there. In other words, Air. Chairman, Kuhn, Loeb &amp;&nbsp;Co. now control and occupy the United States Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Chairman, I demand that all the gold in the custody of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks be placed in the Treasury of the United States. The Federal Reserve banks cannot be relieved of their contractual liabilities and at the same time keep the gold belonging to the Treasury and to the people in their private possession. That gold must be placed in the people’s Treasury in the custody of the United States Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Soviet Government has been given United States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks acting through the Chase Bank and the Guaranty Trust Co. and other banks in New York City. England, no less than Germany, has drawn money from us through the Federal Reserve banks and has re-lent it at high rates of interest to the Soviet Government or has used it to finance her sales to Soviet Russia and her engineering works within the Russian boundaries. The Dnicpcrstroy Dam was built with funds unlawfully taken from the United States Treasury by the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One would not suppose that Mr. McFadden would dare use such language as the foregoing regarding the most important financial institution in the world, and he certainly would not do it, unless he believed every word of it to be the truth. This is also our opinion, that America’s greatest financiers are the biggest crooks that breathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Big Intolerance Drive</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font9">T SEEMS there is to be a big drive against intolerance. Prominent men from 44 states have agreed that Catholics, Jews and Protestants must get along together amicably and they might as well begin now as any time. The country will be traversed by units of clergymen, one from each of the three groups named going to make up a single unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One cannot but wonder if this all had its start in Plainfield, N. J., with the address on “Religious Intolerance: Why” by Judge Rutherford, on July 30. At the very moment when Judge Rutherford was giving that address a woman 71 years of age was in the Plainfield jail for giving out invitations to the lecture, and she had sixteen companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the case came to trial in a higher court it was literally laughed out of court and the counsel for the prosecutors or persecutors admitted openly, ‘It is another victory for Jehovah’s witnesses.’ The following details of this trial were broadcast over WBBR September 15. They will be of interest to many of our readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of you remember that the day before that memorable speech on “Religious Intolerance” given by Judge Rutherford in Plainfield, New Jersey, on July 30, seventeen of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and locked up by the Plainfield police. They had been going from house to house in Plainfield distributing invitations to attend that lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those seventeen persons were held in jail over night. Immediately after the conclusion of his speech at the Strand Theater, Judge Rutherford arranged for release of these men and women under a bond of ten dollars for each. Their case was set for trial on August 7. On that day the city judge, William De Meza, at the request of the city attorney, William Newcorn, adjourned the hearing until September 14, one of the reasons stated being that William Newcorn desired to go away on vacation and also for the reason that there had been so much publicity regarding the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On September 14, yesterday, the seventeen appeared in Plainfield court and according to traditional practice of the court each was given ten dollars or ten days in the county jail, excepting one, who on being asked her age and stating it to be seventy-one, was dismissed with a suspended sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The other sixteen were locked up and later the same day the attorney who represented them applied to Union county judge McGrath for a writ of habeas corpus, which was allowed. Under this ruling of Judge McGrath the sheriff was ordered to present the sixteen persons in court this [Friday, September 15] afternoon. This was done, and then followed a searching inquiry by the judge, who for about one hour listened to the presentations of attorney Jacob Karkus and his learned adversary, William Newcorn. Newcorn, on behalf of the city of Plainfield, tried to insist that the law of the city must be upheld; that these people had flagrantly and defiantly violated the law in not applying first to the chief of police for a permit to distribute the announcements of the mass meeting to be addressed by Judge Rutherford. It was clearly brought out by reading from the law book of the city of Plainfield, which was produced by the city clerk, that there is not even a law on the books of the kind which it was claimed justified the arrest of these persons; and furthermore, that there is no law in Plainfield that provides for a person to request a permit to distribute announcements of the kind used by Jehovah’s witnesses. After patiently and studiously drawing out all these facts for the court record, the judge suddenly announced his decision, that each and all of the persons held in custody by the sheriff of Union county be forthwith discharged; and they were immediately released. Upon hearing the decision, William Newcorn hastened to the bar and tried to tell the judge privately what terrible things these people had done in Plainfield. The judge listened and then let out one big, hearty laugh, and William Newcorn retreated to another part of the room, to join his city elerk, to whom he then spoke, sarcastically but truly: “Another victory for Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Time Required for Gastric Digestion of Foods </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HE digestibility of foods and the time required for their digestion depend largely upon our mental and physical condition and dietic habits. Proper preparation and combination of foods greatly aid in their thorough and quick digestion. Moderation and simplicity also are important factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is well to let at least live hours elapse between meals; more if the digestion is weak, and especially should this time be allowed if the meal contains heavy cereals and proteins. The stomach needs complete rest from its labors. Two meals a day is a solution in some cases, or three light meals in proper combinations. The total digestion of the average meal and the passage of the residue into the intestines takes about eight hours. The stomach is merely a receptacle for food and a preliminary organ of digestion. The main part of the digestion is performed in the small intestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The digestibility of foods is by no means an indication of their wholesomeness; but it is a guide to go by in knowing how soon it is safe to put more foods into the stomach and what kind will mix most readily, in case, for any reason, the digestion of the last food taken has been retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FRUITS, AND TIME REQUIRED FOR DIGESTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The various acid fruit juices, such as orange, lemon, grapefruit, apple, raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, and tomato juice, take one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Two-IIour Class.</span><span class="font9"> Watermelons, tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries, raisins, fresh prunes, plums, pears, peaches, oranges, gooseberries, fresh figs, cherries, cantaloupes, blackberries, avacados and apples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Three-Hour Class.</span><span class="font9"> Fresh green peas, green onions, steamed celery, beets, salsify and baked sweet potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Three-and-One-Half-Hour Class.</span><span class="font9"> Raw celery, grated cucumber, canned green peas, steamed kale, mustard leaves, parsnips, spinach and Swiss chard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most nuts take about three hours to digest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most cereals take three to three and one-half hours for digestion. Hot biscuits take four and one-half hours. Cereals in gruel form such as barley and rice gruel, take about one and one-half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cereals in three-and-one-half-hour class are boiled barley, corn meal mush, pop corn, cooked macaroni, cooked oatmeal, and rolled oats, rye bread, whole-wheat bread, and boiled whole wheat. Whole rice boiled takes one and one-half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Legumes (peas, beans, lentils, etc.) take about three and one-half hours; except in puree form or made in soup form, about one and one-half to two and one-half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">milk and dairy products (time to digest)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cow's milk, buttermilk, cream, whey ami egg whites take two hours. Butter, cottage cheese and whole eggs take three hours; cream cheese, nearly four hours; yolk of an egg and poached egg, two and one-half hours.</span></p>

He needs no advertisement from us, but we are giving him one anyway, and free. In his book of experiments, page 31, he speaks of pouring boiling water into a dog’s intestines; it caused a rise of temperature; should think it might. On the next page he speaks of tearing out the eye and manipulating and bruising the socket after the eye had been torn out; never had this done, but cannot imagine it would be pleasant. On page 46 he speaks of forcing air into a dog’s stomach until it finally burst; great man, that. On page 48, he applied a Bunsen flame to the nose of a fox terrier, and it seems that the dog struggled; now isn’t that astonishing? How this man ever kept out of the ministry, we do not understand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">OW much would you think it would cost to remove from your anatomy that interesting little organ, the appendix, that aids the peristaltic action of the colon, and lubricates it with a minute quantity of oil, needed for its proper operation ? It all depends upon the size of the roll of bills carried in the pants pocket adjacent to the appendix in question. A Pasadena doctor figured that he could get $10,000 from the movie actor, Tom Mix, but Tom gave him $300, which was plenty, and told him to whistle for the other $9,700. The last we knew, they were fighting about it in the courts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">rpiIE learned doctors of the Rockefeller In--L stitute put twenty-eight kittens to death; and here is how they<sup>7</sup> did it. The cats were killed in pairs. The first cat of the pair was cut open crosswise more than halfway around, and the intestines were taken out. Then the entire mass of his kidneys and adjacent parts was removed and placed in a jar. That finished cat No. 1, and, as there was no further use for him, he was put to death, and could be thankful that he got away<sup>7</sup> from the learned doctors so easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was cat No. 2 of each pair that was in hard luck. The second cat was treated the same way<sup>7 </sup>as the first one, except that the whole interior work’s of cat No. 1 was sewed in, in place of the apparatus with which the eat came into the world. It was great fun for the learned doctors. One cat had kittens two days before this highly<sup>7 </sup>intelligent ( ?) experiment, and another gave birth to her kittens two days after such an appalling operation as having the abdominal wall cut transversely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, all fourteen of the cats Nos. 2 died, but the learned doctors could and did watch all the details of their torture to the very end, which in one instance was delayed over a month. To be sure, they learned nothing, for the good and sufficient reason that nothing is ever learned by<sup>7</sup> vivisection, but they had the peculiar satisfaction, if satisfaction it be, of being able to record minutely<sup>7</sup> the sufferings which they witnessed. They saw and recorded at length the refusals of food, coughing, copious discharges from the nose, peritonitis, convulsions, emaciation, enlargement of kidneys, hemorrhages, adhesions of intestines, vomiting, abscesses, high temperatures, evidences of pain, and finally<sup>7 </sup>death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Events in Canada </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HE numerous prison riots have caused an investigation into prison conditions which has brought to light the terrible cruelty heaped upon some of the inmates of these places. The Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font9"> speaking thereof, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The unusual spectacle of convicts in Kingston penitentiary acting as their own counsel while being tried before a court on charges of rioting has been interesting because of the legal talent revealed. But there also have been startling consequences. An astonishing light has been thrown on prison life. Who but an inmate of the institution would have summoned as a witness a man serving a life term and who had spent 23 years in solitary confinement? This was a master stroke by the convict Sam Behan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To objection by the crown prosecutor that the shocking experience of this witness had nothing to do with the charges against Behan, the convict counsel replied: “It has everything to do with them. What has happened to this man can happen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Twenty-three years in solitary confinement! The mind almost fails to grasp the horror of such punishment. This man, emaciated and broken in spirit, gave his evidence in so low a tone that it had to be repeated to the court. Could a witness called from the grave have created a more heartbreaking impression?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Twenty-three years in solitary confinement! Without even the comradeship of other criminals, this unfortunate man had spent nearly half of the fifty-five years of his life. What conduct merited such punishment? The public does not know, but the public conscience will demand an explanation. Penitentiaries are the property of the people of this country; under their administration and in a secondary way the people share the responsibility for what goes on within the stone walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Twenty-three years in solitary confinement! Is that a common punishment for even the most refractory inmate of a penitentiary? No convict in this country ever has been sentenced to such torture of mind and body. Why and by whom is the sentence imposed? Human nature cannot stand such utter misery, long continued. Had it not been for Sam Behan, who knows what goes on behind prison walls, nothing would have come out about this emaciated and broken man who has spent the best years of his life in silence and alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What are the responsible authorities going to do about business such as this? There is in the public mind no thought that convicted criminals should be coddled and entertained; but there is also in the public mind a sense of proportion that regards this man’s punishment as something terrible to contemplate. Twenty-three years of solitary confinement!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Prison Witness Flogged</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Prisoners have been subjected, not alone to solitary confinement, but also to terrible flogging, and in this connection the Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star </span><span class="font9">editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At a trial in Kingston yesterday morning a convict witness did not appear and it was explained that there had been new trouble at the penitentiary in which he had participated with unfortunate results to himself. When one of the counsel asked if he had received twenty lashes, a deputy warden said it was only five. In the afternoon the convict appeared in court with weals upon his back and said he had been flogged. According to the dispatches the warden denied on the stand that the man had been beaten wrongfully by him or on his orders. That he should receive any sort of beating just prior to appearing as a court witness is, of course, very unfortunate. It was explained that the convicts were getting out of hand again and that stern measures had been found necessary. But, as counsel pointed out, “if they had him in a position for lashes, he was in a position to be put in his cell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The whole general question of prison-imposed penalties is raised by this occurrence. Should anyone in a prison have the power to order, without a proper public trial, a punishment such as lashes, which judges impose only with extreme reluctance and after the prisoner has had every opportunity to prove his innocence? The circumstances of the present case should be thoroughly investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A short time ago the fiery Judge Lewis St. George Stubbs was removed from the bench by an order-in-council based upon a report by one Justice Frank Ford, the reason being (although the report does not so say) that he was a champion of the oppressed and told the truth. A Canadian Press dispatch in this connection says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Removal of Judge Lewis St. George Stubbs from the Manitoba bench was the “most disgraceful episode in the history of the administration of justice”, Captain Elmore Philpott, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation supporter, told a meeting here tonight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Judge Stubbs said what everyone knew to be the truth,” said the speaker. “They put him on trial and they couldn’t pin a thing on him except that he told the truth. Apparently a man can no longer be on the bench in Canada and be unafraid to tell the truth. They have done a good thing for the C.C.F. They have shown that judges can be removed from the bench by a mere order-in-council.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Police Ride Roughshod</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">That Canadians enjoy anything but liberty may be gathered from the following article appearing in the Ottawa </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Individual liberties of citizens have suddenly been discovered to have definite and unexpected limits; on all sides we have seen men and women</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">thrown into jail simply for making speeches; peaceful meetings broken up by the police; street parades prohibited or dispersed; so-called agitators arrested and deported after secret trials before administrative tribunals, and the post office is exercising a growing censorship over literature from abroad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is not a report of recent developments in Germany. Nor in Russia, nor Japan nor the Ukraine, nor yet in Poland. It refers to this Fair Canada of Ours, as the politicians say. It is an extract from an address to the fifth annual meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association by Prof. F. R. Scott of McGill University, held in the shadow of the Parliament buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be unfair to assert that Canada is following the most liberal course with respect to civil rights of all self-governing British countries, because we have not the complete record before us. But that Canada is among the worst offenders in this respect we have no doubt. Such a recital of limitations upon personal liberties as that quoted above ought to make the mass of Canadians very perturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the sad part of it is that so few display active dissmt. It is particularly regrettable that men who are looked upon as leaders of opinion, and should see the danger of such limitations in right relation to their historic growth, do not find occasion to protest. Most of the invasions upon the liberties of Canadians are the outcome, as Prof. Scott says, of panickiness in time of stress. But such legal curtailments have a habit of staying on the statute books, as witness the repeated attempts to remove the notorious Section 98. While they stay, Canada cannot be called a genuinely free country. They will stay, however, as long as apparent apathy lulls the majority into a false sense of security.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>&quot;Evil Servant” on the Job</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah's witnesses arranged to broadcast by electrical transcription a lecture by Judge Rutherford in Chatham, Ont., but the mayor, a man formerly associated with the LB.S.A. and who was an &quot;elder'’ of the local ecclesia, revoked the authorization. The Chatham </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font9"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Albert Sheldrick, of the Bible Students, provides the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font8"> with the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The meeting which was advertised to be held in Tecumseh Park last Sunday afternoon, July 2nd, at which electrical transcription of Judge Rutherford’s lectures was to have been given, and for which permission had previously been allowed by civic authorities in charge of the park, was objected to, on Sunday morning, by Mayor Davis and not allowed to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The local members and adherents of the Bible Students feel this announcement is duo to the people and that they should be informed of the attitude of Mayor Davis towards the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the sponsors of the meeting advertised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The rumblings of discontent are becoming louder and louder and were manifested in a riot recently in Winnipeg. We quote from a Canadian Press report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tear gas bombs, batons and bricks intermingled today as police and unemployed staged a sharp skirmish near Winnipeg's city hall. Before the fray was ended, two policemen were compelled to retire with minor injuries and six demonstrators were arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Closing of the out-patients’ department of the General Hospital and announcement of a new relief commission order limiting transients’ relief to two days led to the demonstration which ended in conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chanting, “We want medical aid,” the unemployed marched towards the city hall. A small squad of police shifted them onto Main street, the city’s principal thoroughfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Traffic was tied up and when police charged in an effort to disperse the crowd, trouble began. A section of the mob rushed into a lane and assailed police with bricks and stones. Police reserves with tear gas bombs were called out and the demonstrators were quickly thrown into disarray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Police charged again, wielding batons, when the crowd attempted to rally in front of a police station. Constable A. Bond suffered a cut on the head from a brick and Constable A. Singleton was removed from the melee partly overcome by tear gas.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Liberty Has Passed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Toronto's reputation for unlawful police interference in peaceful assemblies is well known. That the situation is not improved is evidenced from recent happenings concerning which the Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font9"> editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Toronto police continue their illegal interference with free speech in the public parks, and their latest device is to flood the park where a meeting is being held with smoke from the exhaust of motorcycles. This creates, as a morning paper puts it, “a dense, stifling smoke-barrage.” The effect at Trinity park the other evening was that “in a few moments a choking, oily pall hung over the area, and people who respected their clothing and lungs made a hasty exit”. Many of these innocent victims had no connection with the speech-making at all. There is, moreover, no indication that the speech-making itself was other than legal. But the police attacked in force and Toronto is in consequence advertised the world over as a city of riots, another Chicago where disorderly crowds have to be dispersed with smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whatever disorder there was seems to have been the result of the police attack. And even of this there was so little that only one arrest was made, the arrest of a man charged with vagrancy. As on previous occasions, the police did not bring their case into the courts where it could be dealt with on a basis of fair trial and British justice. They create themselves judge and jury and presume the guilt of people who have not even had a charge read out against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This sort of thing is going on in Toronto in face of the fact that there is a simple and legal way to deal with the situation. That way is to let the speakers have their say, and, if they say anything that is seditious or punishable at law, to bring them into the courts and charge them with it. The courts will not fail in their duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of that, the police pre-judge what is going to be said, presume that it will be seditious, and spread a smoke-pall over a public park. Nothing could be more un-British. It is un-British and an end should be put to it. Mayor Stewart suggests as a remedy that certain areas in the parks be set aside for free speech, but stresses rhe point that it must be “free speech within the law’’. To that there can be no objection provided that the courts, and not the police, are to judge what is within the law and what is not. As it is now the police not only judge, but pre-judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All sections of all parks should, when not otherwise in use, be just as available for free speech as any other activity.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Heaping Together Debts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The following editorial appearing in the Saskatoon </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font9"> is quite illuminating in regard to the enormous burdens heaped upon the people by the capitalistic system:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much has been said in the last three years about Canada's indebtedness and the burden it imposes upon the people of this dominion. But it was not until a few months ago, when a committee of the House of Commons made an inquiry, that anything like an accurate estimate of the debt became public. That committee set the total indebtedness, federal, provincial, municipal and corporation, at $8,855,596,800, or, roughly, $855 per head of population. This is large, too large for comfortable payment. Meeting the yearly interest charges and repayments of capital is a heavy burden. It accounts for the weight of taxation and makes impossible any satisfactory reduction of government costs. But it is well to keep it in perspective rather than to accept at once, as is widely done in Canada, the idea that this dominion is about the most heavily indebted country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has been pointed out before that debts in Britain arc larger per capita than in Canada. A comparison with debts in the United States has been difficult, for there has been no complete or reliable estimate available in the past. Now a careful and authentic compilation of domestic debt figures for the republic is available in a recent book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Internal Debts of the United States,</span><span class="font8"> by Evans Clark and G. B. Galloway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The authors divide debts into long-term and shortterm classifications. The short-term class are those maturing in a year, and include bank loans, brokers’ loans, and many other items. They amount to $104,000,000,000 and are actually less now than in 1929. The long-term debts are mortgages, bonded debts of railways, utilities, industrial corporations, as well as federal, state and municipal borrowings. They amount to a total of $134,000,000,000 and have increased by more than $10,090,000,000 in the last three years. That makes a total domestic indebtedness of $238,000,000,000, or, roughly, $2,000 per capita. However, the statistics compiled as to the United States seem to be more complete than those applying to Canada; but even making allowance for that, it is plainly evident that the total borrowings are far greater than in this dominion, possibly double.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is shown further that long-term indebtedness tends to keep piling up. Growth in the last ton years has amounted to nearly 70 percent. If the contention is correct that these debts will keep on growing as long as industry seeks to recover them through retail prices, then it seems obvious the debt structure must eventually collapse through its own weight. That is to say, it is impossible to continue indefinitely taking capital costs out of the purchasing power distributed through production as at present.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Unemployment Here to Stay</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Little by little even the capitalistic press is beginning to see that unemployment is here to stay. The Ottawa </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font9"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are said to be 32,000,000 unemployed in the world. But not all the unemployed are unemployed because of the eminent depression. As has been convincingly shown, if overnight we should resume industrial activity at the same level as in 1929, there would still be many thousands in every country who could not get back their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the American Mining Congress a few days ago, a report was submitted showing that at least 200,000 coal miners “are never again going to make a living at their own trade”. A similar condition exists in the British Isles, and no doubt it could be shown that in a score of major industries nothing like the former number of workers will return, prosperity or no prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This involuntary idleness for an increasing number of men is called “technological unemployment”, and it is no easier to bear on that account. The point to be remembered is that technological unemployment cannot be cured by what is called restoring prosperity. Some workers may be absorbed in other industries, but a progressively growing army must find themselves unemployable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the twentieth-century problem—to treat unemployment rather than cure it. Curing unemployment means its abolition. But as suggested, it cannot be abolished so long as industrial methods continue to improve and “labor-saving” machinery to be invented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several ways out have been suggested. Some argue that no more labor-saving machinery should be permitted. Others declare that when “prosperity” returns, the technological unemployed will be engaged at other jobs. But there must be an end to this process of absorption, and it may have been reached. Still some others, though not many just yet, say that the only way to meet the situation is to draw on national income based on goods and services. But the last method is so new and simple that we are afraid only desperation will drive the nations to it. In any case, unemployment is here to stay.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Achievements of Canadians</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Rather an interesting article noting some of the achievements of Canada appeared in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Alail and Empire.</span><span class="font9"> It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Canadian scientists and engineers have done much to improve the conditions of mankind and to make possible the large industrial and engineering developments of this country. But most of us probably could not recall off-hand many of these achievements. A partial list is given in “Canada Hoy en Dia”, that is, “Canada to-day,” a booklet in Spanish issued by the Department of Trade and Commerce, Ottawa, for distribution at the Canadian pavilion of the British Empire Exhibition in Buenos Aires, which the prince of Wales opened in the presence of a large Canadian delegation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among the more important of these achievements by Canadians are the following: Canada originated Marquis and other more recent wheats which have built up the commerce of the West both in Canada and the United States; a Canadian invented the telephone, and the first long distance trials of that instrument were made in Canada; Canada pioneered in the field of electrochemistry, with the discovery of calcium carbide by a Canadian; Canada originated the idea of Standard Time, which has since been adopted by every civilized country in the world; Canada built and demonstrated the first submarine telegraph in the history of the world; Canada originated and demonstrated train telephones, making possible telephone communication between a passenger on a moving train and an individual within reach of land telephones; Canada operates the largest steam or Diesel railway engines in the world; Canada demonstrated the first practical electric railway in the history of the world; Canada originated the idea of electric heating ; Canada built the world's first electric stove; a Canadian scientist discovered insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We reprint the list here because it would be embarrassing if some enterprising Latin-American visited Canada with a better knowledge than we have of our engineering and scientific accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(We publish the list as offered, merely remarking that the People's Line, Scranton, Pa., was the first practical electrical railway in the world, and is still in daily operation in &quot;The Electric City&quot;.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following interesting article concerning the Niagara falls appeared in the Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Telegram:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The self-destruction of Niagara Falls already is written in its rocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They slope the wrong way, between the falls and Buffalo, dipping back from the brink downward instead of upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So, when a section of the cap rock breaks off, as did the big V on the American Falls, the new brink, formed a step behind, is also a fraction of a step lower. This, geologists say, means finally turning the falls into rapids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Part of the proof for this prediction goes back 25,000 years in evidence that the falls at that time stood at Lewiston, seven miles below their present position. They have cut their way up-river since; but 25,000 years is too long a period to cause much concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, proof of a more immediate nature, promising disturbingly rapid changes in the present, is on file in the records of Dr. H. Rics, head of the department of geology at Cornell University, at Ithaca, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These records cover the 161 years ending in 1925. They show that the falls in that time receded 820 feet, nearly one-sixth of a mile. They show also that the average annual rate of cutting back has been more than five feet. From 1905 to 1925 the recession was 110 feet, just under six feet a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This rapid retreat is on the Canadian side, in the Horseshoe, where the greater part of Niagara runs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">To say that one hates war and then support it amounts to nothing toward the abolition of war. All militarists say that they hate war, and continue to support it.</span></p>

That includes the steel business, the same as every other business, yet when William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, showed up at the president’s steel conference, and offered to speak on behalf of labor, the big six steel executives walked out of the conference. Union labor had its tight with the steel companies forty years ago and lost out in the conflict. Ever since the Homestead riots the steel business has been run on an open-shop basis, and the big steel magnates are so determined that it shall always be an open-shop affair that they even risked a break with the dictator in order to have their own way. By their act they virtually threw down the gauntlet and declared that under no circumstances will they have their plants operated by union labor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font9">ANBY, Oregon, has burned the last of her bonds, sixteen years before it became due. Free street lighting and free water for fire protection have helped reduce city taxes, which are now the lowest in Canby history. Yes, certainly, of course. You know the reason. Municipal ownership.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font9">OLYOKE, Massachusetts, with the lowest gas and electric rates in the East, is now celebrating the thirtieth birthday of municipal ownership of gas and electric plants worth $5,-300,000, wholly paid for out of earnings. Last year, the plants being wholly paid for, they loaned the city treasurer $227,000 without interest. If your city is served by some branch of the Power Trust, please do not ask them to give you their plant, or to loan a quarter of a million dollars to your hard-pressed city treasurer. In fact, you had better not ask them to give you a top electric rate of 4c per kilowatt hour. That is what Holyoke citizens pay.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>The Tennessee Electric Power Company</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font9">HE Tennessee Electric Power Company has put in new rates, and they are something to ponder. The charge is 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub><sup>e</sup> P<sup>er</sup> kilowatt hour for the first 20 kilowatt hours, 714c for the next 20, 4c for the next 40, 2^c for the next 120, and 114c for all over 200 kilowatt hours. With the rates goes an elaborate table, and it would certainly need to be elaborate to justify charging 8y<sub>2</sub>c for something that the published rates show can be sold at a nice profit at 114c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A study of the table shows that the poor man, who, under their old and exorbitant rates, had to pay $1.71 for 20 kilowatt hours, will now have to pay only $1.70. Just think of the relief that will come to the poor! There will be thousands of them that will now have an electric bill that will be lc a month less than it used to be, and they will have that lc to spend on the better clothing, feeding and housing of their families. The poor are the ones who have to watch every penny; and so, of course, every cent that they can save on their electric bills is worth saving. On the new rates 1,000 of them, all together, will save $10.00 in a month. They have to pay $1.00 per month each whether they use any current or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Glancing on through the elaborate table, which occupies four pages of an eight-page folder, we notice that a rich person who formerly (under the old and exorbitant rates now displaced) used 650 kilowatt hours per month and had to pay $28.02 for it will now get it for $14.55. The $13.47 per month which he will save can be used toward a new limousine, or, better still, it can be used to buy more stock in the Tennessee Electric Power Company; and even if the dividends are a little less than they used to be, he will still have the satisfaction of feeling that 1,347 customers who feel the pinch of the hard times and were clamoring for relief have been granted new rates which give each of them lc per month of the money that would otherwise have come direct to him.</span></p>

The president had his salary moved up from $60,000 to $100,000, and now you know one of the reasons why all the big newspapers, which are owned by such men, hold up their hands in holy horror every time the subject of municipal ownership of public utilities is mentioned. Suppose now that the Consolidated Gas Company were owned by the people themselves, how would its president have been able to get that additional rake-off of $40,000 per year ? You can see for yourself what a disappointment it would be to the president and the rest of the gang. One of the assistant secretaries got his salary moved up from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a year, ami he might not have got that either. The president and general manager of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, a woman, had her pay boosled from $14,000 to $20,000 in the same short interval.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It is a fair inference that Jehovah rewards bountifully the efforts of the poor to raise food for their needs, and that when, instead of being used for that purpose, it is wantonly destroyed, it is evidence that somebody has not shown the best of judgment.

They made every effort to be careful, remaining for a long time in Newfoundland before they hazarded the 1400-mile jump to the Azores. Lieutenant Squaglia, the man killed in the Azores, was a fine-looking man, and it seems too bad that the pope could not keep still and give the man a chance to live.</span></p>

But the Reverend Doctor Robert George, pastor of the First Congregational church of Memphis, Tennessee, is reported as teaching his flock that “after [Adam] was driven from the garden he began to progress. He began to work and push toward the top. He has done more since his eviction than he did before.” The natural logic of this is that it was a mistake to put Adam in the garden in the first place, and that it was really a good thing when he disobeyed, so that he could be put out. On the same grounds it can be argued that it would be a good thing to close up heaven, turn all the angels out, and then the whole universe could be made over into something like what this world has been ever since Adam and Eve lost their home in Eden and were sentenced to death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">.4RHAPS having heard something of the silly, foolish and un-American way Jehovah's witnesses have been hounded in various New Jersey municipalities, and jailed for long terms at the expense of the taxpayers for doing something they had a perfect right to do, a joint committee of the New Jersey legislature has just issued a warning in which they have said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The time for soft words has long since passed and there should be no hesitancy in presenting the plain unvarnished facts. Our municipal governments are gravely sick, their credit is exhausted, their incoming revenues are no longer sufficient to meet their day-today expenses. Large numbers of them are insolvent. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among the municipalities that have acted most foolishly in trying to restrain Jehovah’s witnesses of their rights, and have thus unnecessarily burdened their taxpayers are: Asbury Park, Bayonne, Bergenfield, Burlington, Cape May, Dumont, Dunellen, Englewood, Fanwood, Fort Lee, Garwood, Hackensack, Jersey City, Livingston, Long Branch, North Haledon, Nutley, Oakland, Ocean Grove, Plainfield, South Amboy, Summit, Westfield and Wildwood.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font9">HEN, in his letter to the Catholic Press, Judge Rutherford drew attention to their un-American and unmanly methods of suppressing free speech, he stirred some of the hypocritical canines in women’s clothes and dog collars into making some curious statements of just what they think free speech is. Such a statement appears in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Watchman,</span><span class="font9"> of St. Louis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“. . . it is not the intention of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchman</span><span class="font8"> to ruin any radio situation [sic] but only to attempt to drive the ‘Judge’ from the air until he can curb his tongue and stop twisting quotations from the Sacred Scriptures to suit his own ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In other words, Judge Rutherford would be allowed on the air only if he stopped using his own brains and used instead the brains of the 'pope’. The same issue says: “Let our Catholics in this trade area resolve that not one penny of their money will be spent with those firms which make Rutherford’s broadcasts possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a good thing to have these things published in the Catholic press and elsewhere so that when Jehovah God destroys the whole miserable nest of vipers every honest and decent person may rejoice that they no longer cumber the earth which they have disgraced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same issue says that the Scriptures “are the gift of the Catholic Church to the world”. What consummate, what infinite, what astounding super-crust and unmitigated lie! The Scriptures are the gift of Jehovah God; and when “a workman that needeth not to be ashamed” proceeds to use them to the glory of His name, the Catholic church of the Devil is the only institution in America that would deny his right to do so, and they would back that denial with machine guns if they dared; but even when they had the machine guns trained on him they lacked the courage to pull the trigger, the miserable cowards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Holy Year of 1348, 1,200,000 poor misguided dupes traveled to Rome to receive the 'pope’s’ blessing. It is officially estimated that more than 1,000,000 of them never lived to return to their homes. So much for the value of the blessing bestowed by the Devil’s mouthpiece at Vatican City. Watch and see what blessings come to those he has blessed in this “Holy Year” and what curses come to those he would gladly curse if he could.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">G</span><span class="font9">OD'S people are a waiting people; His promises have made them so. “Wait on [Jehovah] ; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on [Jehovah].” “.Rest in [Jehovah], and wait patiently for him.” “Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.” —Psalms 27:14; 37 : 7: Hosea 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The very first promise of Jehovah God, that the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent, automatically causes every one who has confidence in it to wait for its fulfilment. Satan and his crowd wait for nothing; their thought is that if a thing is to he done they will do it themselves; it is farthest from their thoughts to wait on God for anything. They thus dishonor Him with their plans and schemes which leave Him altogether out of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How different, this, from the attitude of the most powerful One in all the universe next to Jehovah God. When the Lord Jesus had been raised victorious from the grave, and when all power in heaven and on earth had been entrusted to Him, He yet waited upon the Father to know when to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Heb. 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And so it comes about in a natural way that the people of God are less aggressive than the children of the Devil. They wait upon God, to ascertain His will. They only seem to be less enterprising. Actually they are more so, as the Devil and all his angels found when once Jehovah God pronounced the word that the time of waiting was over, and the wicked spirits were to be dispossessed from the heavenly realm. Out they went, in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the time of mother Eve to the time of Mary every woman in touch with the divine promises hoped that she might either be the mother of the Savior of men or else be a link in the chain of His genealogy; and the men hoped likewise that they might be used to perpetuate the seed through which eventually the Savior would come to the world that needs Him so much.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Jewish Desire for Posterity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The desire for posterity is inborn in every man and woman, but it was especially strong among the Jewish people, on account of their certain knowledge that the Messiah would be some descendant of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Judah. All the tribes were interested. Ruth, the Moabitess, one of the Lord’s earthly ancestry, was in the line of descent by reason of her marriage to Boaz. And so any woman might hope to be in the line, and any man, no matter what his tribe, might hope to have a daughter that would be in the line, or, if of the tribe of Judah, he might hope himself to be in the line with a son or a daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It thus came about that among the Hebrews the more children a person had the more was he honored, it being considered a mark of divine favor, while sterile people were, on the contrary, held in disesteem. We find this cropping up in the case of Sarah. When Hagar found she was with child by Abraham she no longer gave Sarah proper respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Rachel saw that she bore no children to Jacob, while her sister was already the mother of several, she complained to Jacob that she must have children or else, said she, “I die.” We do not know that this was a threat of suicide, but it may have been so. Oddly enough, Rachel did die in bringing Benjamin into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The case of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, was very similar to that of Rachel. Because she bore no children to Elkanah, her life was made bitter by the taunts of his other wife, who was the mother of several children. Weeping bitter tears she went before Jehovah God, in the presence of the high priest, at Shiloh, and vowed a vow that if Jehovah would give her a man child she would give him to Jehovah all the days of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In due time her prayer was answered and the little one that came along was called Samuel, which means “Asked of God”, and in faithful obedience to her promise, as soon as he was weaned (which was usually at about three years of age), she took the child up to Shiloh and left him there in care of Eli the priest.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>Hannah Rewarded for Her Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Hannah was richly rewarded for her obedience. Not only did she have the fun of being constantly with her child during the three most amusing and interesting years of its existence, but she had the joy that comes from faithfully, meticulously, keeping the covenant she had made with her God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Hannah and her husband came down to Shiloh with the child, they did not come empty-handed. They brought along three bullocks, an ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and when she brought the child in to Eli she said: “Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth,my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto [Jehovah]. For this child I prayed; and [Jehovah] bath given me my petition which I asked of him : therefore also 1 have lent him to [Jehovah] ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to [Jehovah].” (1 Samuel 1:2(5-28) She probably had him by the hand as she said it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then follows the interesting statement that “he worshipped [Jehovah] there”. This can mean nothing else than that the little fellow of about three years of age was in full accord with his mother’s wishes. And from that day to the day of his death there is nothing to indicate that Samuel was anything less than wholly devoted to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no account of any weeping on the part of either Hannah or Samuel at the part they each played, yet we may be sure that the love between them was unusually tender. They both knew they were doing God's will; and that is the greatest joy this life holds for anybody. There is a joy that comes from giving, or, as Hannah put it, ‘lending’ to the Lord, that is unmatched by any other joy of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hannah was overwhelmed and exultantly happy at giving up the dearest treasure of her heart; and don’t you suppose that the Lord knew what she was doing? And don't you suppose that He compensated her? And did He not accept the ‘loan’ and make Samuel one of the very greatest of all the sons of men? We could say that Samuel came from the Lord and went back to Him. Did any other mother in Israel in her day have as great an honor as did Hannah ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>As </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hannah Left Samuel She Prayed:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">My heart rcjoiccth in [Jehovah] ; mine horn is exalted in [Jehovah] ; my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy as [Jehovah] : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like oui’ God. Talk no more so exceeding proudly: let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for [Jehovah] is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">hath many children is waxed feeble. [Jehovah] killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave [s/ieoZ], and bringeth up. [Jehovah] maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are [Jehovah’s], and he hath set the world upon them. He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail. The adversaries of [Jehovah] shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: [Jehovah] shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his King, and exalt the horn of his Anointed.— 1 Samuel 2: 1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are many interesting things about this prayer, one of the longest recorded in the Scriptures. It speaks of the King of the Anointed, when as yet there were no kings and none anointed except the priests. It speaks of humanity’s going down into </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font9"> and coming out of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font9"> which is something that the clergy of the Devil do not believe and are unwilling to teach. It contains more than a hint of Armageddon in its declaration that the adversaries of Jehovah shall be broken in pieces when He thunders upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hannah was one of those who “obtained promises” (Hebrew’s 11:33), and no doubt is included among the faithful witnesses of old. We can gather some idea of what she suffered from the tongue of the other wife in her expression, “Talk no more exceeding proudly: let not arrogancy come out of your mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As she was faithful to Jehovah God she was, of course, a target for the Devil; but Jehovah God was faithful, too, and there is more than poetic fervor in the statement, in the prayer, that “the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble”. We do not know that the other wife thereupon ceased to bear children, but we do know that Hannah thereafter became the mother of at least three sons and two daughters.—1 Samuel 2: 21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>And So to Zacharias and Elisabeth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Centuries later Zacharias and Elisabeth appear in the record, in the days of Herod, king of Judea, and we find here another of those little domestic tragedies that meant so much to the women involved, and to their husbands too, for anything that affects the happiness of a woman is bound to affect the happiness of the man that truly loves her. Elisabeth considered herself under reproach. Zacharias was a righteous man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us have the whole story, just as it appears in the Scriptures:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless. And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years. And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the [holy spirit], even from his mother’s womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. And the angel, answering, said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. And, uchold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. And after those days, his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men. —Luke 1: 6-25.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>Zacharias Richly Blessed, Too</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">At the appointed time the child was born, and her neighbors and relatives rejoiced with her; and her husband was most happy, too, for it seems from the account that it was specially his prayer for a child that was the one that was answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The kind of man that Zacharias was may he judged from the fact that after he was stricken dumb he continued faithfully to exercise the duties of his office until his term had expired. No so-called '■'emergency” was superior to the duty he owed to God. We continue quoting from Scripture:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And it came to p:ms, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother answered, and said, Kot so; but he shall bo called John And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he a<sup>1</sup> bed for a writing table, and wrote, saying, Iris name is John. And they marvelled a'l.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judtea: and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, AVhat manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the [holy spirit], and prophesied, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David; as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy’ covenant; the oath which he sware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, m holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Loi'd, to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto his people, by’ the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy’ of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.—Luke 1: 59-79.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>“The Elias Which Was for to Come”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">And thus started the career of the man of whom Jesus spoke:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses. But what went ye out for to sec? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my’ messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way’ before thee. Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.— Matthew 11:7-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consider now how great a reward came to Zacharias and Elisabeth for “walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless”. Through the path of a sorrow that covered all their married life until they were well stricken in years, they came to be the parents of one of the most noted servants of God of all time and one of the most noted men of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The divine mission of John was the subject of prophecy many centuries before his birth. “This is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” (Matthew 3:3; Isaiah 40:3) “This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.”—Matthew 11:10; Malachi 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The angel Gabriel came all the way from heaven to earth to announce John’s birth. This is the one to whom the Messiah was first revealed. This is the one who baptized Jesus in the Jordan. This is the one to whom thousands came for the baptism of repentance and remission of sins against their covenant. This is the one who proclaimed, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This is the one who said of Jesus, “one mightier than I,” ‘whose shoe latchet I am unworthy to loose.’ This is the one who said, “He must increase, but I must decrease.” He was a burning and a shining light and died as burning and shining lights have been wont to do, a martyr to the cause of truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The parents of John the Baptist were well paid for their obedience; don’t you think so? Here they were, an old couple, with no chance of a posterity, yet they prayed for a son, and at length God gave them their hearts’ desire. “Delight thyself also in [Jehovah]; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto [Jehovah]; trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass.”—Psalm 37: 4, 5.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Parents Well Paid for Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">We have considered four instances in the Scriptures where God sent children into childless and lonely homes because one or both of the parents sought that mercy at His hands. The children that came as a result of these prenatal parental prayers were all remarkable children, Isaac, Joseph, Samuel, and John the Baptist. It is as we would expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No longer is it in order for parents to hope that they shall have children that will do such work as was done by Samuel and John the Baptist. The Messiah in all His power has come; the Kingdom is really here. The prophets and apostles have all done their work. The work now’ is not to bring babies into the world, however delightful parental joys may be, but the work to be done is Kingdom w’ork, the v’ork which God has commissioned to the remnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The world will see to it that the human family does not die out. The remnant need feel no undue concern on that score. Nor, on the other hand, if little ones come, should they be unwelcome either before birth or aftenvard. In any event they are gifts from God and are to be so considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The point of our lesson for today is that obedience brings joy to the sorrowing heart. It matters not what the sorrow may be, if it is not a selfish one, it can be assuaged by bringing it to the Burden-bearer and letting Him take the kinks out of it. He knows how to do it. “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” —Matthew 11: 28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Honest Catholics in Baltimore</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font9">T GIVES us genuine pleasure to reprint the following letter, w’hich appeared in the Baltimore </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Review</span><span class="font9"> of September 1, 1933 (and that despite the use of two </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">participles</span><span class="font9"> intended to designate Judge Rutherford’s talks but that would better have been substituted with something more courteous and kindly). What it does plainly show is that there are some honest men in the Catholic church who resent being led around by the nose by a bunch of crooked priests, and that they are honestly trying to use their own brains in a matter that is of vital public concern, and not afraid to express their resentment at being treated as if they did not know anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Editor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We dislike controversy much ; we resent unwarranted criticism more. In your issue of August 25 The Review states. &quot;The Baltimore and Washington Sections of the Holy Name Society seem to have a difficult time making up their minds to the fact that the Rutherford talks are anti-Calholie. One judges from the actions of these two sections that the Catholic editors of the country do not know what they are talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We admire most, of the Catholic editors, we sympathize with all of them, especially when their readers do not jump through the hoop at the snap of an (ditor's fingers. After all, inerrancy is confined to Rome, and to her in limited matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Holy Name Union meets quarterly, and there are some of us who consider that even Rutherford's roe </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">tilings</span><span class="font8"> do not justify the call for a special meeting'. In parenthesis we add that The Baltimore Catholic Review was critical of the Holy Name a couple of years ago for having too many meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the July quarterly meeting a Holy Name man presented a resolution excoriating this same Rutherford. After an hour's discussion by priest and lay members present, there was practically unanimous opinion that the chair name a committee of ten laymen, who would listen in on the Rutherford talks on three succeeding Sundays and, if his </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">vaporings </span><span class="font8">justified it, that this committee would wait, in person, not by letter, on the management of the local broadcasting station and voice their protest in the name of the Baltimore Holy Name Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Friday night, August 25, nine of the ten members of this laymen's committee met and were unanimous that on the evidence from these three broadcasts no protest against a “campaign of bigotry and slander” was warranted. It is quite probable that Ike broadcasts on these three Sundays were toned down from previous intention by the activity of the Baltimore Catholic Review and other editors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many of us in the Holy Name Union who have not much faith in “I move; I second, and a two or three cent stamp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Respectfully yours,</span></p>

Persons wanting goods are given employment at an hourly wage of 20c, and the employment may be cutting wood, clearing snow from the streets, or even cleaning up one's own yard. Several men were given the jobs of washing the windows in their own homes. Women are given jobs at sewing garments for the needs of their own or other families; those who cannot sew do washing or other work. Forty families are being helped in this manner.

Of course, he did not know that Britain had all along been intending to plunge in as soon as Germany would invade Belgium. And now France, far more warlike than Germany ever was, has also indicated that her signature to a contract is worth nothing, by refusing to pay the small amount of interest she had agreed to pay on the huge sum borrowed from Uncle Sam. The natural result in the United States is an almost universal agreement that it would have been far better, for the welfare of the world, if the Germans had been permitted to go clear through to the Pyrenees and the Bay of Biscay, and they would have done it, too, but for the purchased press and the hypocritical clergy of the Devil here in America that pushed a peaceloving country into the great enterprise of dragging Morgan’s French bonds out of the fire.</span></p>

And the last we heard, the legislature of the state in which Guadalajara is located was expecting to pass a law limiting to eight the number of priests in the second largest city in the country; and that cuts the chances of rebellion down still more. It certainly is tough luck when a church wants to start a rebellion in a country and is not permitted to do so. It looks as if one Ratti and his friends were being given no religious liberty in Mexico to do any political cussedness at all. Meantime the truth is being broadcast all over Mexico.

Anyway, the people of Little Rock have just found they have been robbed, and they are good and mad and will now assess these burglars $1.50 each for their poles.

The investigation has been turned over to the 'Health Department’, and, as they are always regular M.D.’s, that will be the end of it. And that brings us to Fishbein, the president of the American Medical Association, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. He has just written a book in which he proceeds to tell us how superior is the judgment of a member of the American Medical Association to that of Jesus Christ, in the following language: “To the modern informed physician, such risings from apparent death are not miracles because they are perfectly understood. To the uninformed observer of more than 1900 years ago, such an incident might well appear to have been a raising from the dead.” No doubt Fishbein feels that it is just too bad that he did not have an opportunity to teach Christ the importance of vaccination, and to explain to Him that if anything is ever to be done for William G.

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font5">N 1927 the annual consumption of oil for house heating was 11,000,000, but in three years thereafter it had grown to 18,000,000 barrels, and is still growing. In spite of somewhat higher cost of heating a home by oil rather than coal, and the still more objectionable fact that everything in a house heated by oil finally gets to have an oily touch or an oily appearance, the oil heating is popular because adjustments can be made to a nicety and the apparatus requires no attention from one day’s end to another. There are no ashes to handle, and there is no coal dust to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The so-called “coal strike” of 1923, which was a determined effort by the miners to get more money and a determined effort by the operators to pay less, finally resulted in a drawn battle, worked great injury to the hard coal industry. Customers concluded it was a fuel not to be depended upon, and many went over to coke. In 1927 some 4,700,000 tons of coke were used for domestic heating in the east, and last year the amount was more than twice that. Those who have once used coke refuse to return to hard coal, on account of the higher price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every dam that is built reduces the market for anthracite; every steamship that goes over to oil propulsion does the same. Many great manufacturing enterprises have gone over to soft coal because they did not feel sure of hard coal supplies, and they will not change back, on account of the higher prices charged for anthracite and the cost of altering their boilerroom equipment.</span></p>

Among his unsecured creditors was the Right Reverend Thomas M. O'Leary, bishop of Springfield, Mass., who let him have $460,000 of his loose change, together’ with notes footing up to $810,000 more. The Society for the Propagation of the Faith got bit for $75,000. Cardinal Dennis J. Dougherty, of Philadelphia, as archbishop, is sorrowful to the amount of $25,000.

<p><span class="font5">T PHILADELPHIA, in 1839, when the Pennsylvania Railroad w<sup>?</sup>as about to be built through the city, a poster, newspaper size, was circulated, protesting against it. At the top of the poster was a picture of a locomotive running over a child and knocking a plug-hatted citizen’s buckboard off the right of way. A woman with a skirt the shape of a cowcatcher has just escaped. An irate citizen is trying to arouse a cop, but all to no purpose. The wording of the poster was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mothers look out for your children! Artisans, Mechanics, Citizens! When you leave your family in health, must you be hurried home to mourn a dreadful casualty! Philadelphians, your rights are being invaded! regardless of your interests, or the lives of your little&quot; ones, The CAMDEN AND AMBOY, with the assistance of other companies without a charter, and in violation of law, as decreed by your courts, are laying a locomotive rail road! through your most beautiful streets, to the ruin of your trade, annihilation of your rights, and regardless of your prosperity and comfort. Will you permit this? or do you consent to be a suburb of New York!! Rally people in the Majesty of your strength and forbid this outrage!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Africa — A Continent in the Making In Four Parts — Part III</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font5">NGOLA, or Portuguese West Africa, is of the size of all that portion of the United States east of the Mississippi river and north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, with Virginia and a second state of the size of New Jersey thrown in for good measure. The Portuguese have possessed it since 1575. It has a coast line of 1,000 miles, a hot climate, plenty of rain, a soil of great fertility, and could produce enough food to supply the entire present population of Africa. The estimated population is about 4,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the pope divided the earth into two parts, giving everything west of the Azores to the Spaniards, and everything east of them to the Portuguese, he laid the foundation for the Portuguese discoveries and occupations along the African coast. Additionally, the Portuguese held to the correct theory, that Africa is a continent, and that if they pushed far enough down the coast they would ultimately find a way to Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Portuguese have never been good colonizers or administrators. The effort to believe the nonsense of the Roman Catholic religion seems to take away a man’s sense of justice and therefore his common sense. Accordingly we find slavery in Angola. The thing is covered by legal artifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A law is in effect requiring each native to obtain a certificate showing that he has done three months’ hard work within the year. No one is obliged to hire him; but if he cannot produce a certificate, he is seized and forced to labor several months as a prisoner.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>The Best Port on the West Coast</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At Lobito bay the Portuguese have the best port on the West African coast. From this port the British have just completed a railway to their tremendously rich copper mines in the Katanga belt, near Elisabethville, in the Belgian Congo. Copper of the value of $300,000 has already been shipped from the Katanga mines. The knowledge of the existence of the deposits was gleaned from David Livingstone's journal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first train across Africa, from Lobito bay, on the west, to Beira, Portuguese East Africa, on the Indian ocean, made the journey in July, 1931. The route was through Elisabethville (in the Belgian Congo), Northern Rhodesia, the Victoria bridge across the Zambezi, Bulawayo, and Salisbury, a total of 2,949 miles. It took David Livingstone two years to make the same trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is only a little while ago that Lobito bay was one of the principal slave ports of the world, and only about thirty years since the Portuguese authorities cleared up the skeletons and abandoned manacles that marked the old road to the port. The slave trade with Brazil is long since gone. Pretty soon it will be a thing of the past everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Angola is a backward country. As the women wear no waist garments, they have their backs scarified in patterns of which they are very proud. A favorite style of hair dressing is the permanent toque. Clay and castor oil are rubbed into the hair, which is then arranged and allowed to dry. Among the articles sold in the native markets are rats, palm worms, caterpillars and broiled grasshoppers. If you don’t like them you don’t have to buy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bulawayo (SouthRhodesia) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> of July 16, 1932, contains a photograph of a monster lizard, seen in the great swamp at the northeastern corner of Angola, on the edge of the Belgian Congo. At the time photographed, this creature, 50 feet long, was tearing lumps from a dead rhinoceros. The photographs were taken by a Swede, J. C. Johanson, overseer of a Belgian rubber plantation in the Congo state adjoining. It is easily possible that this huge lizard is the oldest living creature on the earth. The sight of it was so terrifying as to cause Mr. Johanson to faint.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>Southwest Africa</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Southwest Africa, grabbed by the Germans in 1884, is of the size of all that portion of the United States east of the Mississippi and north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, omitting Wisconsin. It is suitable for stock raising and dry farming. In the rainy season thunderstorms are frequent and the streams are filled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some reason or other the natives did not want the Germans to take all their best land and shove them out into the drier parts, and so first the Hottentots and then the Hereros, and then the Hottentots again, made it interesting for the newcomers, killing more than two thousand of them, but in the end German arms triumphed. Both sides are said to have resorted to the most savage practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not know that the Hottentots and Ilereros were stirred up by the British to attack the Germans, but they may have been, because it is well known that Cecil Rhodes and other empire-minded statesmen of Britain were extremely anxious to head off the growth of this particular German colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British took over Southwest Africa, after the World War, under a mandate to develop it for the benefit of the natives. They seem to be doing this in true British fashion, if we may judge from the fact that out of 207,000,000 acres in the colony only 5,033,000 have been set aside for the blacks. The other 201,967,000 acres the whites will keep for themselves, as their pay for managing the difficult problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Germans are coming back, and as they have no time or money to go back to Germany to do any courting, the young men are importing brides selected in the homeland by advertisement and correspondence methods. The plan is said to work well; the couples are married before the ship leaves port. If the young man changes his mind he has to pay the young woman's fare back home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The young Germans of Southwest Africa, it is provided by treaty, will not have to bear arms against Germany for thirty years. Three of them living near the capital of the province were recently fined for kidnaping natives and forcing them to work on their plantations under pain of the lash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Southwest Africa is very healthful, dry and temperate and elevated enough to have a good variety of climate. At Mount Brukkaros the Smithsonian Institution maintains a solar observatory for making measurements of variations in the sun’s heat. Near by is a nitrate of soda deposit extending over 10,000 square miles. A meteor was recently found, 10 by 10 by 6 feet, weighing 50 to 70 tons, embedded in a limestone ledge.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>The Union of South Africa</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Union of South Africa, consisting of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal, is of the size of all that part of the United States east of the Mississippi river and north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, with the big state of Kentucky added for good measure. We give the dimensions in this way because the bulk of our readers live in these states and we want them to get an adequate idea of the immensity of the African countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although at present a single political entity, we think we shall make better progress in the study of this subject if we consider these four states separately, even though in some things we cannot do this. South Africa presents the most curious and difficult problems in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a complex of Butch, British and Asiatics in a black man’s country, with governmental, economic and religious problems beyond the mind of man to solve. In this article we can only present facts and tendencies, with something of history. God’s kingdom, the hope of the world, and it alone, as we confidently believe, is the only solution for South Africa, or any other country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a general way, to be supplemented by later statements, we understand that the history of South Africa is as follows: Discovered by the Portuguese; settled at the Cape by the Dutch, who merely had in mind the supplying of fresh provisions to ships en route to the Indies; taken over by the British in the Napoleonic wars; the Dutch try to get away from their masters, whom they do not like, and trek to the interior; at almost the same instant a great horde of Bantus, supposed to be Negroes with an Asiatic strain of blood in their veins, comes down the African coast, destroying everything with which they come in contact; the Dutch dodge the force of this invasion by going into the unoccupied interior; the British meet the brunt of the fight that follows; the original natives arc decimated in the conflict; the British finally overcome the Bantus; gold is discovered in the Dutch territory, the greatest gold mines in the world, and in the Boer War the British take all their possessions; meantime the natives are restricted to compounds or black islands in which their conditions of life are intolerable; they do all the hard work, but are discriminated against most cruelly in wages and in other ways; on top of this they are heathens, and blacks in a land of blacks, while their conquerors, both Dutch and English, are Christians in name but determinedly opposed to Christianity in practice. At this juncture the Asiatics enter the country, take over much of the trade of the whites, and the rulers take over many mandates which bind them to govern these new territories in the interest of the natives; and the mandated territories lie right next door to previously occupied and administered territory which is governed by principles exactly opposite. How to harmonize all this, and to do it in the spirit of Christ, which is to love your neighbor as yourself, and to do to others as you would wish them to do to you, is manifestly beyond the power of any statesman of our time. We now proceed with the more intimate examination of these facts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>Early History of the Cape</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Portuguese explorer, Bartholomew Diaz, in the year I486, in the turbulent waters off the south coast of Africa, was blown 200 miles east of the cape which he called Stormy Cape, but which his monarch changed to Cape of Good Hope. It is one of the most imposing escarpments in the world. Eleven years thereafter the first ship went clear around to India, and thereafter, until the opening of the Suez Canal, it was the standard route to the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1652 Jan van Riebeek landed, with a view to supplying vegetables and fresh meat to the mercantile fleets, and so began the Boers (farmers) of South Africa. In the Napoleonic wars, to get away from the attacking English, and to retain their independence, the Dutch began the series of treks into the interior (interspersed with violent collisions with the native tribes), which were ended by their final subjugation in the Boer War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Survivors of the Boors claim that the British, a hundred years ago, tried to deprive them of their linguistic rights and privileges and persistently favored the natives in any struggles between whites and blacks. In the interim, the Hottentots, and the Bushmen who preceded them, have largely disappeared. But the Bantus (Kafirs) who took their place, and who destroyed them, still outnumber the whites, more than three to one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Dutch are a people of great determination and persistence. Although in the seventeenth century there was a strong infusion of French Huguenot blood, and though many of the names are distinctly French, and a French type can be detected where most of the French settlers located, yet no traces of the French language are left in the South African Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">South Africa, like Canada, is bilingual. One can speak either Dutch or English and will find plenty of people to understand either. At present the Dutch, resisting somewhat the persistence of their British rulers to make the country an English-speaking country, are pressing for the wider use of the softened Dutch which is called Afrikaans. This dialect, formed from contact with the Negroes, is somewhat like the softened English spoken in our southern states. It is readily understood by any Hollander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “Trek Gees” of the Dutch</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children of American pioneers will understand just why it is so hard for the British and Dutch to get along together in South Africa. It is not merely on account of their difference in language. It is because the Dutch were first in the field, and feel that the country is for them and their children. And the British are determined to boss the world, and this does not fit in with the Dutch idea of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Accordingly, animated by the true pioneer spirit, the Dutch have tried to push farther and farther away from the English, which they could do only by pushing up into the relatively unoccupied interior. In due time, Cecil Rhodes and his comrades built a railroad around them and headed them off from any more successful treks, but the “trek gees”, the trekking spirit, the pioneer spirit, is still there, and the result is a people that are perhaps justly accused of being intractable, unreasonable, harsh and refractory. Pioneers are liable to be like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Dutch pioneer’s life called for complete self-reliance. His nearest neighbor was miles away; the nearest representative of the law was several days’ journey away; he had to rely upon his own resources for food, clothing, protection, without the softening influence of mutual intercourse. Such people are hard to handle, and especially the Dutch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably a people were never treated more shabbily than the Dutch at the time of the Boer War. The English may have forgotten that, and have hoped that everybody else would forget it, but the fact stands out in all its meanness that the English spoiled the Boers to get their gold mines, and that was the real reason the war was fought; and it explains why the Boers would still love to get away from the British domination, if they could but do so, but they cannot.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Boers in Present Political Control</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Boers are at present in political control of the government of the Union of South Africa, because in point of population they are in the majority. Under the Dutch prime minister Hert-zog, the head of the British king has been removed from the postage stamps, and the new flag ignores the flag of the British Empire, generally called the Union Jack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a pippin of a fight about the new flag. The British colony of Natal threatened to secede from the Union, and it was finally patched up that the old flag and the new would be shown together. It is like a man wearing an old pair of pants and a new one at the same time. Under the circumstances, neither one is a complete success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">South Africa has non-contributory pensions for the aged, white or black, who attain to the age of Go years and have been resident of the Union fifteen years out of the last twenty. The law applies to whites whose incomes are less than $250 a year and to blacks whose incomes are less than $160 a year, and provides pensions on a sliding scale of between $145 and $87 a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Slowly the South Africans are becoming weaned from their home-country affiliations, so that it sometimes happens that persons of pure British derivation refer to victories of the Boers as ‘the times when we South Africans licked the British’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 13,284 miles of railway and 70,945 miles of roads in the Union. The 149,400 automobiles have seriously cut into the earnings of the railroads. There are five universities; there is telephone service to England. Regular mail airplane service is maintained via Cairo; the racing route is via the west coast. Cape Town had a population of 207,404 in 1921.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>The Collapse of Diamonds</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Maybe you did not know that diamonds can collapse; but they can, or at least the value of them can. In good times diamonds sell freely, but in times like these the sparklers are a drug on the market, and so, to keep the price up, the great diamond mines at Kimberley, which supply 63 percent of the diamonds of commerce, are closed down and waiting for times to pick up. It was in these mines that Cecil Rhodes, by wise use of the $10,000 loaned him by his aunt in England, made his colossal pile. Up to the end of 1913 diamonds worth over $900,000,000 had been taken from these mines in the 46 years of their operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four years ago fresh diamond fields were opened up at the mouth of the Orange river, in Namaqualand. They were discovered in 1921 by the traveler F. C. Cornell. He went to London to see about opening the deposit and marketing the stones, but was killed in a motor accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the new diamond fields came to the attention of the government, eighteen men recovered $800,000 worth of diamonds in eighteen days. The government minister of mines picked up $3,000 worth of the stones in one hour. Water on the new diggings was so scarce that it retailed at 50c a gallon. At one time a mob rushed the new diggings, which are under government control, and it was necessary to send troops to evict them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In two years, from these deposits, the South African government made profits of some $20,000,000. The stones are brought to Cape Town by airplane and kept there in banks for safekeeping until they can be marketed profitably. The profits are used, or to be used, in promoting highways and agriculture.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>An Agricultural Country</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">South Africa is an agricultural country, with 10,000,000 acres of arable land. There are 2,600,000 acres under forests, and more are being planted. When we are busy shoveling the snow off our walks the South Africans are gathering in their crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">South Africa is the natural home of fruits of all sorts. Virtually every fruit used by man is grown in this region; and as the fruits mature at a time when the northern fruit season is closed, there is ready market for these products, although the spoilage is large on account of having to cross the equator. South African pears are in the markets of New York in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost the whole of South Africa lies at an altitude of more than 2,000 feet above the sea. There is rain enough, but it is distributed in such a way as to make it difficult to take full advantage of it. At times everything is dry as a bone; at other times floods occur. Soil erosion is a pressing problem. We have the same problems in some of our own western states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are over 100,000 “poor whites” in South Africa, too proud to do Kafir work, and unable to do anything else. Their homes are devoid of every comfort. Huts are of one room, standing out on the veldt without a fence, a tree, or shade of any kind. The one window is a hole in the wall. The fuel is dried animal manure. There is no privacy, and no furniture worthy of the name. Fleas and flies are both plentiful. Dry-land farmers have learned, as in the west, to plant their crops behind the plow and thus get full benefit of the moisture in the soil.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>The Bantus in South Africa</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Before the Bantus came in contact with the whites they had no orphanages, almshouses or old maids; children were considered an asset; the old folks were cared for. Now they cannot do as they once did. Seven out of every eight still live in rural areas, but Europeans own four-fifths of the land, and fully half of the four and one-half million Bantus in South Africa are to be found on farms which are mostly European-owned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whites have been content to allow the Bantus to be mine-boys, pastors, teachers in the native schools, kitchen boys and lawyers or doctors practicing among their own people, but they have insisted that the whites draw ten times the wages, so that the Bantus will have a more existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To provide for the “poor whites” that cannot take care of themselves (and one white man in every twelve in South Africa is in this category today), the government has put capable blacks out of their jobs on the railroads, and has even discriminated between mulattoes and Negroes, favoring the former at the expense of the latter. It seems that most of the mulattoes are Dutch, and can vote, and the Dutch who are in power appreciate their votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bantus have a choice of whom they work for. There are whites in Africa who think natives must be compelled to work for them at as low as 75c a week, plus food, and some of these black men cannot reason well enough to know why their white brothers should wish them to be always at the border-line of starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Infant mortality among the Bantus ranges from 450 to 650 per thousand births. Does he need to have his white brother lift him up, or is he getting along all right? Formerly, when children reached the age of puberty they were given much needed instruction. Now the white policy of ignoring the whole subject is followed. Is that better ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Africans can be readily taught to know and to love and to honor Jehovah God, but they cannot quite understand why the white man has 213 ways to approach Him. They sometimes ask, “How many gods are there? Which god are we asked to believe ?”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Samples of Negro Reasoning</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Negro says that one white man came along and told him to close his eyes and pray, and while they did it other whites came and took away their land while they kept their eyes closed. They say that first they had the land and the white man had the Bible, but now they have the Bible and the white man has the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One man refused to have his name put down in the church roll. He said, “If I take this religion, you whites will take my name down in your book, and a government magistrate will follow and take my land in your absence.” And the black man does not understand why the white Christians kill one another in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The black man suspects that there is something wrong with a religion that takes all the happiness out of a man’s face and all the hope out of the future, and he objects to having the white man suddenly and forcefully come behind him and kick him into heaven, or even into comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blacks consider the British very severe, but very just. They consider the Boers much more severe and much less just. General Smuts is in favor of an aggressive policy of settling Africa with white people who will best civilize the African native by giving him white employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Premier Hertzog asserts that South Africa will not observe any other standard than its own conscience, and will follow no dictates but those which its own interests and reason prescribe. This is merely another way of saying that there is a class of the Dutch in South Africa that believes in the iron rule, quite mercilessly applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The legislation, for which we understand that he is responsible, which makes it a legal offense for a black man to perform skilled labor, strikes us as one of the most outrageous injustices ever wrought into law. How is the African ever to be lifted up if he is perpetually held down ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The practice tried out here and there in Africa of herding the Negroes into special reserves has failed, and deserves to fail. Out of a total electorate in the Cape province of 170,000 there are 15,000 natives that are qualified by property and education to vote.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>And Here We Pause</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">And here we pause, for a moment, to think of conditions in America. The Negro may legally vote in our southern states, but in practice he is debarred from the polls by a great variety of devices. He is discriminated against in appointments and promotions under the civil service, and is rarely given appointment at diplomatic and consular posts. His race is segregated from the whites in offices of the government. He is denied training at Annapolis, West Point, and for the air service. He is discriminated against on relief and public works projects. We could write an entire article on the mistreatment of the Negro here in the United States, and indeed have already done so. See our issue No. 18, “Facts About the American Negro.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most horrifying disclosures of recent years is in a book entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Georgia digger, </span><span class="font5">written by John L. Spivak of New York. In this hook Mr. Spivak reproduces photographs of Negroes in Georgia being broken on the rack and wearing iron collars, etc., in the prison camps in 1932.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>What White Would Stand It?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What white would stand it to have to get a pass to live with his wife, or another pass to visit a family down the street, or another pass to work for a pittance of two or three shillings a week, a tenth of that paid to whites no more intelligent or capable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">General Smuts is against a policy that would de-Africanize the childlike African and turn him either into a beast or into a pseudo-European. Today a million of the Cape natives manage their own local affairs under the supervision of European magistrates, and this policy has been spread to the other states of the South African Union. It seems like a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He calls attention to the fact that from time immemorial the natives have been subject to a stern, ruthless discipline, resting on the despotic authority of their chiefs. This authority is now breaking down, and it is the detribalized native that is the greatest problem in South Africa today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is easy to make a mistake in dealing with the natives. About ten years ago a tribe, called the Bondels, extremely poor, was charged an excessive dog tax of £2 per dog, which they felt unable to pay, and refused to yield obedience. The government sent a force of 370 men with artillery, machine guns and two bombing airplanes, with the result that 49 out of 200 of the men constituting the tribe were slain. Their leader had been mentioned in dispatches for his great bravery when fighting on the British side in the World War. Several women and children were killed and 700 were taken prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the natives, even of the Cape province, are gradually coming to be more and more convinced that the whites mean to hold them in perpetual servitude, seems borne out by the riot at Worcester, in May, 1930, in which five natives were killed and nineteen natives and three police were very seriously injured. This was in a district very near to Cape Town itself.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>The Liberal Thought of the World</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The liberal thought of the world is that the true path to progress in Africa is to give the African a square deal, to cease regarding him as merely a worker, a servant and a producer, but to recognize him as a consumer, with money to spend, and free to sell his labor where he will. The lands reserved for the blacks should he abundant; there is no reason why they should not be so; and they should be good lands, not the sterile places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They should be permitted to purchase lands outside of the reserves, and there should be full citizenship, regardless of race, sex, creed or color, with a franchise test common to all. The most liberal thought of all is that the Lord himself is going to straighten the thing out himself and do it shortly, and do it right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six hundred miles east of Cape Town, but still in the Cape province, is the district known as the Transkei (Beyond the River Kei), the part of the country where the natives have made the greatest progress, and where the Europeans are, on the whole, allowed to settle only as traders, business men, administrators and clerks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The relation between Europeans and natives there is one of very friendly cooperation; and a very small police force maintains order. It appears that men of some vision and a genuine feeling for the interests of the natives have laid the foundations for a liberal conduct of the affairs of a race that is generally described by those who know them best as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘a</span><span class="font5"> race of children’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The childlikeness of these natives may be inferred from the following advertisement, published in September, 1929, in the Transkeian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette:</span><span class="font5"> “If Beta Mabinza does not return to her home before the end of the month, Abram Mabinza will consider himself at liberty to take another wife.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a native college near by, at Fort Hare; there are quite a few native papers in the different native languages; the Bible is in all the principal native tongues of Africa; at Um-tata, in the Transkei, there is a fine building for the meetings of the native parliament, an advisory legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No native is allowed to sit in either of the houses of parliament for the Union, though they have at times sat in the provincial council for the Cape province. Tribal jealousies and linguistic obstructions stand very much in the way of cooperation among the natives for united action on any subject, and this is true even among the more educated ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are glad to be advised by a South African subscriber that while the native does give place to the white man on the footpath, he does so because of his innate politeness, and not because he must, and for the same reason, and that only, he comes on the run when he is called. There is no '‘must” about it in either case.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>The Influence of the Missionaries</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is too bad that the missionaries have not told the natives something about the purposes of Jehovah God, for then they might have done them some good; but, of course, they could not reveal to others something that was unknown to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">General Smuts charges the missionaries with having broken down the natives’ entire outlook on life, and we add that they have put nothing worth while in its place. The World War exposed the whole inconsistent, hypocritical, foolish, devilish system which has been palmed off as the ‘•'Christian religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British missionaries and the Boer farmers have always been at swords’ points over the cpicstion of how to treat the native. A hundred years ago the Boers claimed that the London Society’s stations were the refuge of the worst scoundrels in the country and simply formed a sanctuary for the criminals of the country. On the other hand, the missionaries complained that the landlords regarded the mission station in their neighborhood as a convenient source of compulsory labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries in bygone years have claimed to exercise the determining voice in the native policy of the country, and this seems borne out by the fact that it is now in such a tangled and unsatisfactory condition. In the Treaty of St. Germain, signed 1919, it is stipulated that “missionaries shall have the right to enter into, and to travel and reside in, African territory with a view to prosecuting their calling”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not the influence of the missionaries that has made South Africa “religious”; it is inherently so, excessively so. The Europeans report 1,621,670 (nearly everybody) as members of some church; and there are 2,025,476 church members among the non-Europeans; a remarkable showing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>The “Coloreds” and the Asiatics</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are 500,000 “Coloreds” and 200,000Hindus in South Africa, and they are our brothers, as well as the blacks and the whites. The “Coloreds&quot;, or Mulattoes, as we call them in the United States, are mostly in the Cape province, and the Hindus are in Natal, brought there to work in the sugar-cane fields between 1860 and 1911. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The competition of the Hindus has been too much for the Europeans. In the smaller villages of Natal and the Transvaal, they have ousted the European trader. It is due to his lower standard of living that the Hindu has become a menace to European employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From these considerations it will be seen what a huge and impossible political program the whites of South Africa have reared for themselves in their determination to maintain a white supremacy at all hazards. A minority, and among them more than a hundred thousand “poor whites”, are trying to ride on the backs of all the rest without a spill; an unlikely feat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the error of bringing over into Africa huge hosts from India was clearly seen, an effort at repatriation was made; but it was too late, and was fiercely resented in India. Tens of thousands of the Hindus now living in South Africa (80 percent of them, so it claimed) were born there, and there they will stay. Mahatma Ghandi’s passive resistance policy originated in South Africa in an effort to help the Hindus residing there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Hindus crowd more whites into the ranks of the “poor whites&quot;, and as the supposedly more “civilized” “Coloreds” get more of the railroad and other jobs hitherto held by the blacks, the poor blacks are getting the worst of it all around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Already sufficiently complicated, the South African labor situation was made still more complex by the action of Herbert Hoover and his friends in bringing in thousands of Chinese to work in the Transvaal gold mines, and now, at last, the Japanese, not acceptable as immigrants, and kept out by a gentleman’s agreement, are, nevertheless, coming in as merchants and underselling everybody. A recent report cites merchants as being dismayed because they sold an excellent pair of shoes, well made, with rubber soles and canvas tops, at 35c a pair, and that they went like hot cakes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Scientific and Unscientific Vegetarianism </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Walter Siegmeistcr (X. Y.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">ODAY food faddism is in vogue; there are vegetarians, raw foodists, fruitarians and adherents to many other extreme dietetic cults. These beliefs can scarcely be considered as scientific, since they are based merely on the personal preferences of their adherents rather than on proven facts of biochemistry and physiology. These food faddists tend to look down upon science with disdain as something ultraconservative and out of date, each believing that he alone possesses “the truth” and that all others are in error.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark209"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>Fallacies of the Cults</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A vegetarian diet is not necessarily a healthful one, nor necessarily better than a mixed diet. Whether it is or not will depend entirely upon how well or poorly balanced it is. Many people give up meat, and replacing it by consuming an enormous quantity of whole wheat bread, beans or nuts, are worse off than they were before. It is much less harmful to eat a little meat together with plenty of vegetables than to eat a lot of whole wheat bread, beans or nuts. Many become “moral” vegetarians and commence upon a career of bread-eating, beaneating and nut-eating, and ruin their health in consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer has approached the study of diet from the viewpoint of the physiological chemist and the physiologist. He has done so with an open-minded attitude, seeking the truth alone, and not striving to uphold his preconceived prejudices on the matter. He has gone into a study of the chemistry of food, the chemistry of the human body, and the physiology of nutrition, which studies he has pursued in universities, both in this country and abroad. These studies have enabled him to gain an exact biochemical knowledge of diet and nutrition and to understand the fallacies of various dietetic cults.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark211"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>The Unscientific Vegetarian</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The main trouble with the average mixed diet is that it contains an excess of protein and fats, and that this excessive protein and fat is transformed into acids which intoxicate the organism. The thing to do is to reduce the intake of protein and fat to the physiological minimum, and to replace them by a corresponding increase in the amount of carbohydrates and alkaline minerals eaten. This means to cut down on meat, chicken, fish, fats, butter, and eggs, and to consume more vegetables, fruits and potatoes. But the unscientific vegetarian who believes that the only dietetic sin is the killing of animals for food and who eats a large quantity of whole wheat bread, peanut butter and beans, may eat a larger quantity of protein and fat than an average mixed feeder and may, therefore, introduce a greater amount of toxins into his blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scientific dietitian believes in a low-protein diet. The experiments of Professor Chittenden of Yale University in 1903 have convinced the scientific world that an excess of protein is harmful, since it forms uric acid in the blood, and this uric acid poisons body and brain. Professor Chittenden found that physical and mental energy increased on a low-protein diet which cleared the blood of uric acid and that many bodily symptoms from which he previously suffered disappeared when the amount of protein eaten was reduced.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>Results of Experiment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The next scientist to study the question was Dr. Hindhede, an eminent Danish student of nutrition. In his nutrition laboratory at Copenhagen Dr. Hindhede put subjects on a low-protein diet in which potatoes were the only source of protein. One of these subjects was a hard-working man, who worked from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and who lived on an almost exclusive potato diet for a year, during which time he enjoyed perfect health. Later experiments by Dr. Hindhede have established as a scientific fact that potatoes are able to supply the human body with all the protein it requires, so that other protein foods are unnecessary. Dr. Hindhede had one subject live for two years on a potato and vegetable diet and he found that this was a complete and healthful diet which is able to supply the human body with all the nutritive elements it requires: protein, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins. This was confirmed by Professor Rose in the nutrition laboratories of Columbia University. For experimental purposes the writer has lived for three years on such a diet, abstaining from flesh foods, eggs, dairy products, grains, nuts, legumes, fats, sugar, salt, tea and coffee. Potatoes not only can replace meat and eggs in the diet, since they contain a protein of equal value, but are also able to replace grains; for, while grains are acid-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">forming, potatoes are alkali-forming. Besides, potatoes require only 15 minutes to digest; grains require two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Ilindhede concluded that the body’s need for protein is very small, and that almost everyone eats from live to ten times as much protein as he really needs. This excess protein is transformed into uric acid, which poisons the system and is a cause of many diseases. It makes no difference in what form this protein is eaten, whether as meat, as eggs, as beans, nuts, whole grains; in any case the same uric acid will be formed and the same bodily poisoning will result. The safest course is to avoid all concentrated protein foods and subsist on foods containing less protein. The chief danger in animal foods is the fact that they are so rich in protein that it is impossible to eat so small a quantity as to avoid obtaining an excess. The same is true of nuts. But when potatoes are used as protein food there is the least danger of eating too much protein, since potatoes contain only about 2 percent of protein, while meat, beans and nuts contain about 20 percent. Besides, potatoes contain strong alkalies which neutralize and counteract whatever uric acid may be present in the blood, and for this reason are superior to all other protein foods, which are more or less acid-forming.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>Where Bacteria Dwell</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Meat, fowl and fish, as usually purchased, are swarming with putrefactive bacteria which infest the human colon, generating toxins which are absorbed into the blood, causing a variety of diseases. Eggs, also, tend to promote intestinal uncleanliness and autointoxication. Potatoes, on the other hand, not only are free from these dangerous bacteria, but supply an abundance of carbohydrates which fosters the development of the protective acid-forming bacteria which protect the body against the harmful putrefactive types. Potatoes are the best substitute for animal proteins, but, if they are not available, beans may be used, for beans also contain alkalies which counteract acidosis. However, care should be taken to avoid eating too many beans, for then an excess of protein may be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a scientific point of view, a diet of potatoes and vegetables is physiologically complete and supplies the human body with all the elements it requires, as Dr. Ilindhede proved by extensive experiments. Animal foods are the worst type of foods to depend on, because of their acid-forming tendency and their tendency to encourage constipation, intestinal putrefaction, and autointoxication. To avoid and remove such conditions, meat, fowl, fisb and eggs should be rigidly excluded from the diet. The writer has done so for the past dozen years, and Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, has avoided these foods for the past sixty years, and today, at the age of 85, he is in perfect condition physically and mentally, is director of the largest sanitarium of its type in the world, and lectures and writes extensively. George Bernard Shaw' is another vegetarian who has preserved his physical and mental faculties until the same age. Both Dr. Kellogg and Mr. Shaw’ are opposed to the use, not only of meat, but also of alcohol and tobacco. Dr. Kellogg claims that not only flesh foods and eggs, but also dairy products, are unnecessary, and that W’e will be better off without them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>The Scientific Vegetarian</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is therefore a school of scientific vegetarians (to which Dr. Ilindhede and Dr. Kellogg belong, as well as the English surgeon Sir Arbuthnot Lane), which is much different from that of the moral vegetarians. The former claims that meat should not be eaten, not because it involves the killing of animals for food, hut because it is physiologically harmful, and that a fleshless, eggless, and milkless diet is able to promote the highest degree of health and vitality. These foods introduce into the body a host of harmful bacteria as well as rapidly decaying food material on which these bacteria feed; and, therefore, they should be avoided. Potatoes contain an excellent protein which can take the place of the foods just mentioned. Potatoes are also better than grains, nuts and legumes. A diet of vegetables, potatoes and fruits is best.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Potato Prejudice </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. W. G. Wright (Michigan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the potato was introduced into France, shortly after the discovery of the New World, the peasants could not be persuaded to use this perfectly wholesome tuber until the clergy and nobility wore the flowers from the potato as a boutonniere. Probably Mr. Hatti could be persuaded to do a similar service for this generation and remove the prejudice that still exists in some localities concerning the use of potatoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was during the looting of Peru by the brave eonquistadores about the middle of the sixteenth century that the Spaniards discovered the potato growing in the neighborhood of the modern city of Quito. Thence it was introduced into Spain by the monks, and afterwards into Italy, Belgium and England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In England the potato made little headway, even though endorsed by the Royal Society, in 1663. In 1666 Chabraeus included it among the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;plantae malignae et venenatae”.</span><span class="font5"> King James, who was very enthusiastic about the divine right of kings’, wrote a tirade against the potato. It is only within the last century that the potato has been extensively cultivated in England. In 1586, Ireland received, from North Carolina, her first importation of what is now her national vegetable. They were first grown on Sir Walter Raleigh’s estate near Cork. They are now so extensively cultivated in Ireland that a failure of the potato crop is sometimes the cause of famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The potato is useful as an article of food chiefly on account of the excellent quality of starch that it contains. This constitutes 18.8 percent; the remainder of the tuber is made up of 2.1 percent nitrogenous matter, 3.2 percent sugar, 0.2 percent fat, 0.7 percent salts, and 75 percent water. There are two qualities of the potato starch that especially recommend it as an article of food. In the first place, the starch of the potato has been found by experimentation to be one of the most excellent foods for preserving the alkalinity of the body tissues. This, of course, combats acidosis, which is one of the chief faults of the diet of civilized people. Other starches, such as bread, and especially whole wheat bread, cause acidosis and deplete the alkaline reserve of the body. It is for this reason especially that more potatoes and less broad should be eaten, in the interest of health. Another feature that recommends the use of potato starch in place of grain starches is its ease of digestibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Professor Grierson, an eminent German physiologist, conducted some experiments a few years ago to determine the time necessary for the digestion of starches from various sources. He found that it required two hours for the digestion of the starch of wheat, corn and rice; eighty minutes for that of oatmeal; thirty minutes for arrowroot; while the potato starch was completely digested in the short space of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ten minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people are afraid of overeating starchy foods. While it is, of course, possible to overeat of starches, yet it by no means creates the havoc that excess protein creates. On one occasion a patient asked a noted doctor if starch were good for the human race. “Huh!” he replied, “if it weren’t for starch there wouldn’t be any human race. Starch is a very necessary part of our diet supplying the organism with heat and energy. The potato supplies one of the finest and most easily digested starches, and its use should be encouraged and, where possible, should be substituted for the starches of grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[May we add a word? If there is anything more delicious ox- more wholesome than baked potatoes, served in the ‘shell’, and eaten with salt and butter, shell and all (so as to get the minerals the shells contain), it is hai'd to conceive what it could be. How anybody could cook potatoes any other way, or eat them any other way, after he has once had them baked, is a mystery. And all the farmers have potatoes, and many of them have butter that they are glad to trade for books about the Kingdom.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TX7TIY </span><span class="font5">will not men listen? Why are they so ’ ’ blind? Nay, but they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font5"> listening and they cannot hear, because the prophets are dumb. The clergy could know the truth, but they will not see it. The church is drugged by conservative tradition, bound hand and foot by its alliance with property and capital, and paralyzed by worldliness, and will not lift up her voice against those sins which are destroying our race: luxury, covetousness, the love of pleas-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ure. As long as the church is as worldly as the world, she is bribed to silence, and has no power to save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">if we wish to rid the church of the worldly spirit which is paralyzing her, we must deal both with the personal life of each Christian and also with the corporate life of ecclesiastical institutions. The decay of personal religion allows church institutions to become hopelessly corrupt. The pompous worldly standards of official Christianity stamp out the spiritual life of individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bishop in his palace is almost as out-ofdate as a major-general would be in his castle. The polished, gentlemanly clergyman of the last century is as ill-trained for his work as the average subaltern. The gross misapplication of funds in church and army has been done in such a gentlemanly way that it is a real shock to realize that it is utterly wrong, and must be mended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The church has unconsciously adopted the very standard of the world, and estimates all its official life by money values. It makes one shiver to note how far we have drifted from the gospel of poverty and simplicity of life when we can represent the standard of values in the church by the following table:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One bishop in a palace . . £3,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One dean in a deanery . . £2,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One canon in a stall . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£800 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One episcopal horse in a stable £400 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One parish priest in a vicarage £200 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One communicant in a cottage £100 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One candidate for holy orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">in a college......£50 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So while the bitter cry from the heathen world goes up to heaven for more teachers, we realize that an episcopal horse costs as much as a missionary bishop. This blighting curse of a money value for the ministry of a gospel which condemns the love of money is not the creation of a disordered imagination. It is the recognized method of the officials of the church. At the Liverpool Church Congress it was urged on the people of Liverpool that such a noble city should have a really lirst-class dean for its cathedral. And how were they exhorted to get one? They were told that they could buy one for an extra £1 ,000. The sum of ‘’£5,200 (for the dean £2,000, and four canons at £800 a year) was a great deal in excess of the estimated minimum stipend suggested in clause 22 of the Liverpool Cathedral Act of 1885, but as they were expecting worthy leadership in the church of Liverpool they must be prepared to pay a fair wage for it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is it any wonder that our cathedral cities are the most immoral in England, and that some cathedrals are the strongholds of sloth, and the sepulchres of enthusiasm and zeal ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not try to avert the sure judgment of God by an act of national repentance and amendment of life? Why should not the church try to come back to Christ? We clergy are in danger of becoming a ministry of false prophets, who will not face God and truth, but spend all their efforts in emptying the words of Christ of their real meaning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">rpiIE device is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The government shall issue, say, $1,000,000,000 of a new kind of paper currency. To distinguish it, it shall be, let us say, red. It shall be, subject to one condition, legal tender the same as existing currency. This $1,000,000,000 the government shall turn over to a contractor or contractors to build public works. The contractors shall pay for labor and materials with the new currency. At this first transfer of the new currency, the ingenious condition takes effect. The contractor must paste on each bill, as he pays it out, a two-cent stamp. The laborer receiving the bill can buy food with it because it is legal tender. The laborer must, however, paste another two-cent stamp on it. Each time the bill changes hands an additional two-cent stamp must be pasted on it. Each stamp, of course, must be canceled and dated at the time it is pasted on. lifter fifty transfers, the bill will have fifty two-cent stamps on it. For those two-cent stamps the government will have received, obviously, $1. With this dollar, the government redeems the bill and destroys it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The government, at this point, has got back all its new currency, and has the public buildings which were erected with the new form of mmiey. The government is exactly where it was before, except that it owns some new buildings, or new roads, or whatever the money was spent upon. Clearly the government has benefited. Clearly the country has benefited because unemployed men have been put at work. Clearly business has benefited because business has been active. Much business has been done, much buying and selling and employing which, otherwise, would not have been done. This increase in volume of business is one of the chief merits claimed for the scheme.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(At this point, after having made this able and sensible analysis of a monetary system that is endorsed by so able a man as Prof. Irving Fisher of Yale University, and has worked well wherever it has been tried, i.c., at Sehwannenkirken, Germany; Woergl, Austria; Hawarden, Iowa; and, in a modified form all over central Europe for two hundred years from A.D. 1150 to 1350, the banner years of her medieval history, Mr. Sullivan apparently lost his nerve and said he believes the idea is wrong, but that a friend of his, a Harvard graduate with a fine and exact mind and engineering experience, asserted that the device, if adopted, would be the greatest boon to man since Christ. Mr. Sullivan’s Titanic is sinking beneath his feet; the bottom is ripped clear out of her; he might better listen to his Harvard friend than to remain immovable where he is. Already the swish of the inrushing waters has stopped the engines and the waves are coming over’ the top rail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meantime, the only remedy for earth’s monetary troubles, and all her other troubles, is God's kingdom, the hope of the world. At Armageddon, just ahead, as we believe, the Almighty will show His irresistible power in behalf of His own honor and for the benefit of all people of good will, by putting to death all deceivers and oppressors. Incidentally, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font4">was the first periodical in the United States to give publicity to the form of money mentioned above.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE advantages of the self-depreciating -*• money first advocated by Silvio Gesell are gradually becoming more widely known. The following suggestion, accredited to deputy city treasurer of Chattanooga, J. P. Winn, is a practical plan that would do much to end the depression and would give everybody in the country the immediate use of $25. The plan would work, and it should be adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persuade the government to issue a new $1 bill and lend to each man, woman and child in our country twenty-five of these bills. This issue would be different in appearance, but its purchasing and paying power would be equivalent to our present $1, as it would be legal tender for all taxes, debts and purchases. The bill must be enlarged to allow the placing on its back fifty-two spaces for two-cent stamps and the explanation that it cannot be held more than one week without placing one two-cent stamp thereon, and that the bill will be redeemed within one year if all stamps required are attached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“He Shall Judge the World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is the God of justice. His standard of righteousness is manifested in all judgments involving His creatures. “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.” (Ps. 89:14) He rules the universe by the laws of justice, and all creatures who avail themselves of the great privilege of cooperating with Jehovah in His great organization must conform themselves to the just standard of the Most High. “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom. 12: 2) Where there is uniformity of thought and action there is harmony and peace and efficiency in the accomplishment of the great work. On the other hand, if every creature were to follow out his own course of action throughout eternity there would be many standards of practice, confusion and endless strife. Jehovah is the God of order, of righteousness and peace. But right here let it be noted that He does not sacrifice truth and justice to maintain peace; when the occasion demands He rises up as a mighty God of war to vanquish the wicked that justice and peace might ultimately have free reign. He makes war to establish justice and peace which involve the vindication of His own name and the eternal blessing of all obedient creatures. —Rev. 19:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The term “justice” herein considered refers to Jehovah’s standard of righteousness. The word “justice” occurs twenty-eight times in the Bible, and in every instance except one it is taken from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tsadaq</span><span class="font5"> (meaning to be or to make right). The derivations as nouns from which it is most frequently translated mean </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the right, equity, rightness, rectitude, justice</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">virtue.</span><span class="font5"> It will also be of more than passing interest to note that the figurative meaning of this word is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">prosperity.</span><span class="font5"> Indeed those who have loved righteousness have at times been dumbfounded at the prosperity of the wicked, and the psalmist says that their feet were almost gone and that they were in danger of slipping. But as we carefully examine the Word of the Lord, we see that the end of the wicked is destruction, while prosperity is promised for Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Field Marshal, in His forward charge for truth and righteousness. “But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.” (Ps. 73: 2, 3,16-18) “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.”—Ps. 45: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While it is true that Jehovah manifested justice in sentencing Adam to death because he had knowingly disobeyed the Most High, and the glint of the sword that flashed like lightning must have struck terror into the hearts of the first pair as they, looking back, reluctantly departed from Eden; yet the day is still future when the creatures, both the visible and the invisible, will see the greatest display of power in behalf of divine justice. The hand of Jehovah was again manifested in the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; the mighty wind, the standing of embankments of water like mountains, the sudden collapse of the watery wall, and the shrieks of the enemy: all of these must have caused the Israelites to tremble. But what happened to Pharaoh in the Red sea is but a picture of the infinitely greater manifestation of justice that awaits the complete destruction of the Devil’s organization in the coming battle at Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark219"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>Necessity for Manifestation of Justice</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will make a demonstration of His power so that all creatures will know that He is God. He will act first of all in behalf of His own righteous name, and also that justice may be brought to all creatures. Those who stand on Jehovah’s side will receive good at the hands of the Creator, while the wicked will be destroyed. (Ps. 145:20) The necessity, therefore, for the manifestation of justice in the near future is to establish the righteous name of Jehovah. Not all creatures believe that Jehovah is really the great God. Satan has drawn mankind after himself, the enemy has blinded the people to the truth, and the foolish people have blasphemed the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Back in the garden of Eden Lucifer had the sacred privilege of directing the human race in the course of righteousness. He was placed over the first pair of human creatures to protect and instruct them. Seeing that the earthly creatures were made to honor God, the Creator, Lucifer became lawless and contrived a way whereby the earthly creatures might be drawn away from their first love. He reasoned that if he could induce man to lose faith in Jehovah, by misrepresenting the instructions given by the Almighty, then this subtle one (Lucifer) might have control of the human family independently of God. Many people since that time have fallen into wickedness by leaving Jehovah out of consideration in their course of action. This is a dangerous thing to do, because all creatures are so made that they must depend upon and worship Jehovah. (John 5:30) Adam was told that he would enjoy life and the blessing of the Creator as long as he was obedient, but in becoming disobedient he would die. Lucifer misrepresented the truth which God had given the first man and told Eve that man would not die by disobeying the law which God had given.—Gen. 3: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer also induced Eve to believe that she would gain some very valuable information which only the gods had the privilege of knowing. (Gen. 3:5) Thus the wicked one wished Eve to suspect and distrust the Creator. This has been the wedge which the enemy has always used to destroy faith in God. A loyal creature confidently relies upon the word and promise of the Creator; a disobedient creature lacks faith in Jehovah which is necessary to establish a confidential relationship with the Great One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Lucifer induced the first pair to disobey God, the word and the name of Jehovah were brought into question. His word was questioned because Lucifer substituted an idea which was at variance with the plain statement of God. From that day to this the enemy has been keeping the human family away from the Word of God by substituting various creeds and ideas, which, being wholly at variance with the plain laws of the Creator, destroy belief in the Word of the Lord. His name was brought into question and blasphemed because the first pair no longer had the true conception of and reverence for their Maker. The name is that by which Jehovah is known. When a creature misrepre</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sents the law and works of the Lord he to that degree brings reproaches upon the name of the Creator. This is the very thought that is recorded in Psalm 74: 10, “O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?” (See also Psalm 74:18.) It does seem to many that the end of reproach will never come and that the enemy will have his way at all times. But not so; Jehovah will bring both His word and His name to light so that all who wish mav know Him as He is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are Jehovah’s witnesses today in the earth and who are desirous of seeing the name of God vindicated, with indignation against the enemy say, “Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproach-eth thee daily. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee incrcaseth continually.” (Ps. 74: 22. 23) Jehovah is jealous for the right, that Ills name and people might be blessed. His fury and wrath will shortly break forth upon His adversaries. Only those who are wholly devoted to the Lord, who have pure hearts and clean hands, will be able to stand before His indignation. “God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord re-vengeth, and is furious: the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.” —Nah. 1: 2, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Lucifer’s rebellion in Eden his name was changed to that of Devil, which means ‘the slanderer’; to Satan, which means “adversary”; to Serpent, which means ‘the one who deceives’, and to Dragon, which is the ‘one who devours’. These names serve to identify the enemy from the time of his deflection to the present, and his actions and those of his children call for a sharp and destructive judgment. It is the enemy, the serpent, who deceived not only Eve, but all who, seeking the way of God, have been led into the course of darkness. It has been the Devil who has slandered and blasphemed Jehovah and all connected with His organization. The Devil has thought that he could drive the creatures away from God’s organization by setting up slander and reproaches against the righteous. Satan has been the one who has opposed all who have been for the Lord. This he has done by persecuting such, throwing some into prison, and killing others outright. (Rev. 2: 10) The dragon has sought to devour the Lord’s cause in the earth by destroying the truth, nullifying the effect of the Kingdom message, and by destroying the seed of promise.—Rev. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another thing which calls for rectification is the blatant hypocrisy as practiced by individuals and by institutions that have grossly misrepresented the name of Jehovah. It was in the days of Enos when men began to call themselves by the name of the Lord in order to gain prestige and deceive the people. One who parades as a representative of Jehovah and practices that which belongs to the Devil is a hypocrite. The clergy have been guilty of such practice, and they are awaiting the manifestation of adverse judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil began to organize people in oppressive cities very early in the days of the human family. These cities gave power and support to the builders thereof. The Devil taught his cruel rulers very early how to clamp the oppressive saddles on the backs of the people. Wherever the Devil has had his way he has kept the common people in ignorance and away from the truth by occupying their time with useless labor and foolishness. It has only been by the protection of Jehovah that a few men of faith have espoused the cause of truth down through the ages. These heroes of faith have been hated and have suffered every kind of hardship and punishment because of their loyalty to Jehovah. Even at this time the Devil seeks every means to disrupt and destroy the work of Jehovah's witnesses, and also to blot out God’s representatives from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time came for the Devil to organize on a larger scale and he began the first world empire, in ancient Egypt. This was the beginning of the great ‘sea beast’ mentioned in Revelation chapter thirteen. It will be noted also that a “wild beast” well pictures Satan's oppressive and tyrannical rule of the human family by means of his dominating world empires. The sea represents the peoples of earth who are alienated from God and who mother, nourish, bear up and support the visible part of Satan’s organization. The successive histories of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the Anglo-American Empire, all bear evidence of the hard and cruel manner in which the people have been domineered over by these national organizations. The people, especially in recent times, have been crying out for relief, and the time has come for justice to be manifested in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent times the enemy has camouflaged his mimic organization vitli the name “Christendom'’, but in fact this giant system has been doing the work of its father the Devil. In the name of Christianity the people have been op</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">pressed, </span><span class="font5">the laborers have been robbed, wars have been waged, and Jehovah's witnesses have been subjected to all kinds of persecution. The Prophet Isaiah, in writing for Jehovah, describes the wicked rule of &quot;Christendom”, in the fifty-ninth chapter, beginning with verse two: “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he v. ill not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. None call-eth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.” These things cannot go on; the time has come for them to end, and Jehovah through Christ Jesus will establish justice and for ever dethrone iniquity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark221"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>Execution of Justice in the Kingdom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It must be apparent that when the clash began between Christ Jesus and Satan this would precipitate a great time of trouble. This had to come. Jehovah will make a clean sweep of every work of iniquity in the earth. In setting things right it is to be expected that some will be injured in the battle and many will fall under the sharp sword of the great Judge. In 1914 Jehovah set Christ Jesus upon the throne of the new kingdom, and warfare immediately began against the enemy. This resulted in the Devil's being cast down to the earth. Jehovah and Christ Jesus saw deplorable conditions in the earth at the outset of the Kingdom. No one was found in the Devil's organization who would intercede for the poor and oppressed; therefore, the new King put on the garments of vengeance and clothed himself with the cloak of zeal. “Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yea, truth fail-eth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.”—Isa. 59: 14-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord caused Moses to speak of the time when judgment would be upon His professed people, and He mentioned that as applying “in the latter days” in which we are now living. While these words were spoken originally to Israel, they have a direct application to the professed people of God who have lost faith and turned aside from the way which Jehovah has commanded. “For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.” (Deut. 31:2b) After enumerating the sins and wayward course of both of the faithless houses of Israel the speaker continues, “For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left. And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted; which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. See now that I, oven I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.” (Deut. 32:36-39) Here the Lord Jehovah speaks of justice and that in the judgment He will kill the wicked, but will heal and cause to live with bouyant health all who have been oppressed and turn to Him for help. “For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance [judgment] to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.” (Deut. 32:40-43) Those who are loyal to Jehovah have reason for rejoicing, for they see by faith the name of their God vindicated and the triumph of the truth as a result of the fiery judgments and indignation manifested against the enemies. “For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recom-pences for the controversy of Zion.”—Isa. 34: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The manifestation of Jehovah’s justice not only works destruction to the enemies, but works for the health, welfare and life of those who seek righteousness. The time for such favor and blessing from the Lord could not take place under the reign of Satan, but takes place near the beginning of the reign of righteousness. “Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not; behold, youi’ God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped: then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.”—Isa. 35: 3-6.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark223"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>Safety in Jehovah’s Name</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is the safe course for the creature to follow’ now’ ? Long ago the Creator made provision for those w’ho would seek righteousness and meekness at this time w’hen judgment is upon the nations. In Proverbs 18:10 we read, “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” Indeed those W’ho are of the remnant, that part of the Servant yet on earth, may claim this promise because they are Jehovah’s witnesses; yet it is always appropriate for anyone who seeks righteousness to do what he can to bring honor to the name of the true God. The purpose of the existence of all creatures, as declared by their great Maker, is to praise Jehovah, and before they can praise Him at this time the people must know who He is. They should know something of His kingdom and the gracious provision which the Lord has made for them. In due time all honest-hearted people of earth will turn toward Jehovah and render their praises to Him. —Zeph. 3:8,9; Zech. 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great responsibility, therefore, rests upon the remnant of God’s people now upon the earth, and that is to inform all about the true God, Jehovah. And what is the reason that the people should know about Him? Knowledge concerning Jehovah and His purposes gives the people the only opportunity to choose safety and life and in an intelligent way to praise the true God. “Ye are my witnesses saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.”—Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see, therefore, that there has been the greatest necessity for the manifestation of justice in destroying the works of iniquity from the earth: the name of Jehovah requires vindication in the judgments soon to follow; the blood of the innocent who have gone down to death under the cruel hand of the oppressor calls out for retribution; and the people cry out for a better government. Man cannot adjust these things. Jehovah can and will bring relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all the people. Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. The king’s strength also loveth judgment: thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name: they called upon the Lord, and he answered them. He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. Thou answeredst them, 0 Lord our God: thou w<sup>r</sup>ast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill: for the Lord our God is holy.”—Ps. 99.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font5">VERY one of the 13 books is complete in itself, but yet you need all of them to fully appreciate the wonderful outworking of Jehovah’s purposes. In 13 of the greatest books ever written, Judge Rutherford has produced a detailed explanation of the Scriptures that has proved to thousands of thinking people that at last there has been found a way in which the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, can be understood as a reasonable, beautiful, harmonious record in divine prophecy. Proof after proof is brought forth to show that only one of superhuman intelligence could have been the author of that which has come down to us as the Word of Almighty God. Not only does Judge Rutherford through his books give the most amazing revelation of God’s purposes as found in the Bible, but by his explanations of the fulfilment of prophecies written centuries ago he proves conclusively that people now living are about to witness the grandest spectacle this world has ever seen, the establishment of God’s kingdom over all the earth!</span></p>

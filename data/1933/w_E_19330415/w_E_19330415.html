<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font3">the benefit of subscribers it is here repeated, by way </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">explanation, that discontinuance of an expired subscription is accomplished mechanically in every case.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO AND THE PRINTED WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AU witnessing parties and aU individuals who engage in the witness work should mention the radio station in their vicinity that is broadcasting the watchtower programs. This often proves a means of opening the way to place the books in the bands of the people. Have in mind that the chief purpose of the radio is to call the people’s attention to the truth and then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding of the message concerning the government of Jehovah by reading what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one who now participates in the field work in territory served by broadcasts of the watchtower program may have si share in telling the people that this unique service is available each week. Workers report that distribution of the radio folder (supplied by the Society) is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font3"> public notice of this program while engaging in the house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNOUNCING MEETING PLACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where the radio is used to broadcast the Truth, it would be well to announce the local meeting place of the company for Bible study. Consent to so announce should be obtained from ihe manager of the station, and, since the time is paid for, it is presumed that this may be done. This will enable the interested to find a place for study and further consideration </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Lord’s Word.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TESTIMONY OF JEHOVAH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Hear, 0 my people, and I will testify unto thee: 0 Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me.”—Ps. 81:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH selects human creatures and clothes them with authority and provides the ways and means for them to be his witnesses, that they may testify to the honor of his name. He chose the Israelites and put his name upon them that they might be his witnesses. As a nation they were unfaithful to their commission. “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” first had a like privilege of bearing testimony to the honor of Jehovah and likewise fell because of unfaithfulness. From Abel to John the Baptist there were a few men who maintained their integrity towards Jehovah. He caused them to be mentioned with his approval, and he designates them in his Word as ‘a great cloud of witnesses’. (Heb. 12:1) He sent Jesus to earth and provided him with the means to bear witness to the truth; and Jesus faithfully fulfilled his commission and received from his Father the title “The Faithful and True Witness”. (John 18:37; Rev. 3:14; 19:11) Beginning with the apostles of Jesus and down to the end of Satan’s world Jehovah has taken out from amongst men a people for his name, which people he has provided with the ways and means of bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah. To his chosen ones he first gives his testimony in order that the witnesses may know what they are to bear before others; therefore Jehovah says to those whom he has chosen: “Hear, 0 my people, and I will testify unto thee.” The selected ones who are unfaithful in the use of the ways and means God provides for them to be his witnesses receive a just recompense for such unfaithfulness and which is given according to the degree of unfaithfulness. Those who are faithful and energetic in the use of divinely provided means receive Jehovah’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HAND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> When Jehovah’s time arrived to make for himself a name in Egypt, he selected Moses to be his witness and clothed him with the means to bear such testimony. In order that Moses might be sure that Jehovah was with him and upholding him, God gave him three signs. In order that the Israelites might know Jehovah and might know that the God of their fathers had appeared unto Moses, and had sent him to the Israelites, these three signs Moses and Aaron performed before the Israelites. The second sign was concerning the hand. “And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.” (Ex. 4:6) Manifestly the hand in such an instance was used as a symbol to teach Moses and others of God’s chosen people a specific lesson. There seems to be no good reason why the sign of the leprous hand should be performed before Pharaoh, and there is no record that it was performed before him. This seems plainly to teach that the sign pertaining to the hand is one of the means employed by Jehovah to testify to his selected people, and to them alone, and is to inform them, that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they may</span><span class="font4"> be equipped for his service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> What is the symbolic meaning of the hand of Moses as here used in this picture? It has been said that the hand is a symbol of divine power always, but the Scriptures do not at all times support that conclusion. When Jehovah puts his hand upon a creature, the Scriptures show that such means that Jehovah has selected that creature and clothed him with authority to perform certain duties in the execution of God’s purpose. Jehovah has selected Christ Jesus as his special elect servant whom he uses to execute his judgments, and therefore he is symbolically the hand of Jehovah. “If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.” (Deut. 32:41) All just powers reside in Jehovah; and the fact that he has committed to his beloved Son all power in heaven and in earth is further proof that Christ Jesus is the elect instrument of Jehovah to execute his purposes and hence symbolically represented by Jehovah’s hand laid upon him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Ezekiel had a vision concerning which he said: “An hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.” (Ezek. 2: 9,10) The roll or book is a symbol of a message or testimony of Jehovah, and its being in a hand symbolically says: ‘ This testimony is provided by the power or spirit of Jehovah, and this is his means of making it known.’ When the time came for Ezekiel the priest to begin his service he says concerning the same: ‘And the hand of the Lord was upon me.’ (Ezek. 1:3) “And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.” (Ezek. 3:22) When the time came for Ezekiel to proclaim the prophecy concerning the royal house, it is written, ‘ ‘ the hand of the Lord was upon me.” (Ezek. 40:1) In these texts “the hand of the Lord” clearly means that Jehovah has bestowed upon his creature divine favor and authority to represent him in bearing his testimony, and this he has done by and through Christ Jesus, who is his chief means of carrying out his purposes, or his right hand.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">115</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> When the hand of a creature is employed or used the symbol clearly teaches a different thing. Let it be kept in mind that it was Moses’ hand that he put into his bosom and which there became leprous. For two reasons that hand could not represent divine power: (1) because it was the hand of a creature; and (2) because divine power cannot become leprous. Nor could the hand that became leprous represent anything in the heavenly or invisible part of Jehovah’s organization, because that part of his organization never becomes sinful or displeasing to Jehovah God. The conclusion, therefore, must be that the hand of Moses represents something pertaining to the followers of Christ Jesus while they are on earth and while in an imperfect condition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> For the foregoing reasons the following definition is given of the symbolic meaning of the hand: The hand of a creature on the earth, which creature is in a covenant with Jehovah, symbolically represents the divinely provided ways and means or equipment of that creature to actively engage in the service of Jehovah. In support of this definition the following is submitted: Moses was being sent to Egypt, not to deliver his own message, but to deliver Jehovah’s testimony. Jehovah had provided the ways and means and had equipped Moses to do that service. For Moses to become negligent or slothful in the performance of that service after having undertaken it would have been sin, and sin is symbolized by leprosy. Such negligence or indifference would be illustrated by putting the hand in his bosom, even as Moses did. “A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.” (Prov. 19:24) (See also Proverbs 26:15.) He who would thus do would become poor and an unfruitful servant. “He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.” (Prov. 10:4) These Scriptures definitely prove that the hand is a symbol of activity and service and that when it becomes inactive disintegration always follows.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> This miracle or sign God gave, and it was being performed chiefly for the benefit of God’s covenant people on earth at the end of the world, hence intended to teach them a special lesson. (Rom. 15:4) These covenant people, particularly the remnant, God has taken out for his name’s sake, and has provided them with the ways and means and equipped them to bear his testimony to the world. To be negligent or slothful in the performance of that service would be sinful. Jesus tells of the “wicked and slothful servant” who was disapproved. (Matt. 25: 26) Jehovah’s witnesses are admonished to be “not slothful in [the King’s] business; [but] fervent in spirit; serving the Lord”. (Rom. 12:11) “That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. 6:12) “The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.” (Prov. 21:25) These scriptures show that unfaithfulness and inactivity on the part of the servant, result in sin and death, whereas zeal and faithfulness in service bring the promised reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup>Moses was making a picture under Jehovah’s direction. The putting of his hand into his bosom symbolically teaches negligence or slothfulness in the use of the ways and means with which Jehovah provides and equips his servant class. As the Israelites were in a covenant with Jehovah God, even so that organization that is called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” was in an implied covenant to do the will of God by reason of having taken the name of Christ and assumed to teach God’s Word. Jehovah provided them with the ways and means for bearing testimony, or his message of his kingdom, to others, and in this “Christendom” became negligent, slothful, sinful, and was led into death. That organization put its hand in the bosom and became very slothful and hence sinful; and when the World War came on, it became even more sinful by completely repudiating the kingdom of God and adopting in its place and stead the Devil’s makeshift, which is the League of Nations. Thus “Christendom” presumptuously assumed to set up a kingdom of its own contrary to God’s will and to perform a priestly service unwarranted, like unto that attempted by Uzziah, who was smitten with the incurable disease of leprosy. (2 Chron. 26:16-23) Attention was called to the incurable condition of “Christendom” in the pouring out of the first vial of God’s wrath upon “Christendom”. “And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.” (Rev. 16:2) “Organized Christianity” will never be restored to the favor of Jehovah, because of the incurable disease resulting from unfaithfulness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> The picture made by Moses, however, more particularly concerns those of God’s covenant people who will ultimately prove their faithfulness. That does not mean that a time would not come when they would be in an unclean condition. There was a period of slothfulness in the Lord’s service on the part of the consecrated and to which the Lord Jesus referred in the parable of the virgins and said: ‘When all the virgins slumbered and slept.’ (Matt. 25:5) During the World War and for some time thereafter the consecrated were fearful, and there was very little testimony delivered. That slothfulness and negligence or lack of vigorous activity in using divinely provided ways and means to serve Jehovah God brought the consecrated into a leprous or unclean condition. “A leprous man ... is unclean. . . . And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.” (Lev. 13: 44, 45) It was in the year 1922 that the Lord revealed to his covenant people their uncleanness resulting from inactivity in service. A picture thereof was set forth in the prophecy of Isaiah wherein that prophet represented God’s covenant people, and which prophet represented God’s covenant people as saying: ‘‘Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King: the Lord of hosts.” (Isa. 6:5) That uncleanness clearly was due to lack of activity or to slothfulness in the use of the divinely provided ways and means to deliver the testimony of Jehovah, and this is shown by the fact that the prophet was cleansed by fire being put upon his lips: ‘‘Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar ■ and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.”—Isa. 6: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The hand of Moses in his bosom particularly represented the period of time from 1918 to 1919 inclusive when there was little or nothing done in the way of giving the testimony of Jehovah. God told Moses to take his hand out of his bosom, and when he took it out then he discovered that it was as leprous as snow; and God told him to again put his hand into his bosom. “And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and plucked it out of his bosom ■ and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.” (Ex. 4:7) The command of Jehovah here given teaches that Jehovah would not completely cast away his people, but that, when informed of their unclean condition, if they then manifested repentance and became zealous for the Lord he would again bring them into his favor. Note that the record is that the first time he “took” his hand out of his bosom, but the second time Moses “plucked it out of his bosom”, which latter action indicates that he did so quickly and with energy and with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. When in 1922 Jehovah’s covenant people discovered their uncleanness because of their inactivity in God’s sendee, as was prophesied to by Isaiah, they immediately became active and the service work went forward from that time with energy and zeal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The conclusion is further supported by the following: Jehovah has selected his people to bear his testimony to his name. (Acts 15:14) He has given them certain work to do, which is pictured by the hand, and to be pleasing to the Lord it must be done with energy, as it is written: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.” (Eccl. 9:10) This admonition was written for the benefit of the remnant as was every other admonition in the Scriptures written. (Rom. 15:4) Furthermore for the benefit of the remnant it is written: “In that day [the time following the second coming of Christ, and particularly after he comes to the temple for judgment] it shall be said to Jerusalem [Jehovah’s covenant people], Fear thou not; and to Zion [the anointed of God’s organization], Let not thine hands be slack. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing. ’ ’ (Zeph. 3:16,17) God rejoices over his servants when they are zealous and faithful, and is pleased when they thus faithfully bear his testimony. “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” (John 15:8) The lesson, therefore, is that the remnant keep themselves by faithfulness and zeal in the performance of the terms of their covenant, which covenant requires them to bear Jehovah’s testimony as his witnesses. That means that they must be entirely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom in order to be clean; as it is written: “ Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52:11) “Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.” (2 Pet. 1:10) “And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Rev. 19:8, E.P.) Such “righteous acts” consist of full obedience to God in keeping his commandments and in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ committed to them. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 156.) The faithful remnant, without slacking of the hand, must continue to deliver the testimony of Jehovah until Satan’s organization is destroyed.—Isa. 6:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> No cure for the disease of leprosy has ever been found by man. The only cure is by the power of Jehovah, and he cures only those who obey him. ‘ ‘ Christendom,” like King Uzziah, was willfully disobedient to Jehovah and will never be cured of the deadly malady symbolized by leprosy. The hand of Moses was healed only after full obedience to the commandment of Jehovah. The covenant people of Jehovah can be healed and kept clean only by the willing obedience and unselfish devotion to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE PROOF</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah graciously furnishes cumulative evidence to strengthen the faith of his covenant people, and this is proved by the fact that he gave Moses more than one sign. “And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.” (Ex. 4:8) It was in 1919 that the Lord revealed to his people that Elisha foreshadowed another work that must be done by his witnesses, and yet even then many were slow to grasp the importance of that truth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> August 1 and 15, 1919) In 1922 the Lord brought further evidence to the attention of his people that Christ Jesus had come to his temple, that the remnant had been cleansed and that “Christendom” had been smitten fatally; and then the anointed began to appreciate the truth that Jehovah had sent Jesus Christ to the temple and the purpose for which he was sent. They began to see the great importance of the kingdom. It was doubtless then that Jehovah gave to his people their new name, and later revealed that fact to them. Thus he has given cumulative testimony to his people during the past ten years.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD SIGN</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah is long-suffering with his creatures and continues to show forth his loving-kindness to all who seek to know him and to serve him. This is illustrated by his giving Moses the three signs. “And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.” (Ex. 4:9) It was out of the river Nile that Moses took the sample of water. Egypt depended upon that river for her wealth, business and commerce, and hence it pictured particularly the commercial part of Satan’s organization. The Devil claimed that he made that river and that it belonged to him. (Ezek. 29:1-3) It was chiefly the commercial support of Satan’s organization. It was chiefly the commercial element that Satan used to bring about and carry on the World War. The commercial part of his organization has afflicted the world with its doctrines or propaganda, and it is Satan’s commercial element that is chiefly responsible for the economic difficulties and depression now upon the people, causing them much distress and suffering. For some time Jehovah’s anointed people, in declaring his testimony, confined their work to the ecclesiastical or religious element, but in more recent days the commercial part of Satan’s organization has come in for its part. In the picture Moses took up the water out of the Nile and poured it on the dry ground; and now the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus and those of his organization, take a sample of Satan’s commercial organization, represented by the water, and give attention thereto. As the people of Egypt thought the Nile waters were good for drinking purposes, so the people of the world, including many of the consecrated, have thought that the commerce of the world is vitally essential and is refreshing and is life-sustaining; and hence some of the Lord’s people have engaged in the commerce of the world and later have come to sorrow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The water which Moses took out of the Nile he poured upon the dry land. At that time many people resided in Egypt but who were no part of the official organization. Today there are many people in the world who form no part of the official organization of Satan and are completely out of heart sympathy with that organization. These include the class of consecrated who will form the “tribulation” class, and also the class foreshadowed by Jonadab and which are often mentioned as people of good will. The Scriptures mention the dry land in contrast with the sea; therefore the “dry land” well represents the consecrated people and those order-loving people on earth who have a sincere desire to see righteousness established amongst men. (Hag. 2:6,7; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> 1931, page 53) Bear in mind that the performance of these three signs was primarily for the purpose of establishing the faith of the Israelites, foreshadowing God’s covenant people on earth, and that performing the two of them in the presence of Pharaoh was secondarily for the purpose of serving notice upon Satan’s representatives. Jehovah first showed his anointed people that commerce is the mainstay of Satan’s visible organization, and this he did in order that the people might be strong in faith and active in proclaiming the truth against that part of the enemy organization. This proves that the witnesses of Jehovah must pour the truth upon the “dry land”, that is, the consecrated and order-loving people, and must do.so in the presence and hearing of Satan’s representatives in order that all may have an opportunity to know that Jehovah is God. Jehovah’s anointed people now know that the commerce of the world is not life-sustaining, and also the Jonadab class are learning the same thing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> To Moses Jehovah said: “The water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.” Thus today Jehovah shows his people, and those of good will, that commerce originated with the Devil, that it is the most powerful part of Satan’s organization visible, and that Satan has employed it to carry on his bloody and death-dealing work for centuries past upon the nations of the world. This being true, that water is not fit to drink, and those who are in a covenant with God and who then drink it shall die and not live. Not only the consecrated, but the Jonadab class, see that if they would live they must flee from Satan’s oppressive organization and take their stand on the side of Jehovah. For the benefit of his covenant people Jehovah caused to be written: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”—1 Tim. 6: 9,10; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 35; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 221; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, pages 76, 77.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The fact that commerce or big business is a part of Satan’s organization and is oppressive and deathdealing Jehovah began to make known to his people first in 1927. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font4"> pages 23-28.) The books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication more</span><span class="font4"> fully brought these truths to the fore. Thus Jehovah has instructed his own people and has shown them that it is his testimony that they must give against Satan’s organization and they must be zealous and active in declaring it against every part of Satan’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEFORE PHARAOH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah’s covenant people have believed and rejoiced in these great truths that have come to them by his grace, and now the Lord emphasizes the necessity for them to use these ways and means which he has given them and to bear substantially these truths before the rulers of the world. Moses and Aaron appeared before Pharaoh and performed the first sign, which only angered Pharaoh and hardened his heart. Then Moses performed the third sign before Pharaoh, which was the first one of the ten plagues which came upon Egypt. Jehovah told Moses that Pharaoh would defy the first sign and refuse to let the Israelites depart out of Egypt. Then to Moses Jehovah said: “Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.” (Ex. 7:15) The rod which Moses had used before Pharaoh to perform the first sign he was now told by Jehovah to take in his hand and to stand by the river’s brink. That rod represented the Vindicator, Christ Jesus, carrying into operation the purpose of Jehovah by virtue of the power and authority which Jehovah had delegated to him, the explanation of which has appeared in a previous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> The appearing of Aaron before Pharaoh, and acting under the instruction of Moses, pictured Jehovah’s witnesses on earth proceeding under the direction of Christ Jesus, the Head of Jehovah’s organization, to appear before the Devil and his organization and to serve notice of God’s purpose to take action against that wicked organization: “And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou would-est not hear. Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. ’ ’—Ex. 7:16-21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup>By his “hand”, Christ Jesus, Jehovah now sends forth his witnesses, the remnant, to bear his testimony before the peoples of the world and to serve notice upon the rulers that the time has come for the people of God to go to the mount of God, that is to say, to the kingdom, and to give their allegiance to Jehovah; and to tell them that God’s kingdom is the only hope for the world, and that Satan and his organization must cease to hold the people in subjection and bondage. In the performance of the third sign before Pharaoh Jehovah foretold that the loathsomeness of commercialism would be made to appear before the people and the rulers. The pouring of the water upon the dry ground shows to those who have the hearing ear that commercialism is death-dealing and is dead, and cannot lift the people out of the great depression which Satan has brought upon them. It is of significance that the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were then domiciled, was not spared from the plague of blood on the ground; and this would seem to clearly teach that the people of God on earth are not spared from the effects of the great commercial depression that is now upon the world. Such is exactly in accord with the facts as they exist. Beginning with the fourth plague upon Egypt the land of Goshen was severed or separated from the effect of the plagues.—Ex. 8: 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The fulfilment of the prophetic picture made by Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh has at least begun, and there is much evidence to show that the same has been fulfilled. When Jehovah turned the waters of the Nile into blood, that was notice to Pharaoh, and hence notice to Satan and his organization, that commerce is done for, and is as good as dead. This was the third sign, and corresponded with the third trumpet of God, who through Christ gave commandment to the angel to pour out the third vial upon the rivers; as it is written: “And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, 0 Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.” (Rev. 16:4-7) “And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.” (Rev. 8:10,11) These prophecies began to have fulfilment at the Columbus convention in 1924. That was five years before the financial crash came upon the world, in 1929; and that warning to Satan and his organization was given in the form of an “ Indictment” and the declaration that ‘‘civilization is doomed”.—See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 121.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Satan’s organization never contained life-giving waters, although the people had been induced to believe that commerce is essential to the sustaining of life and the welfare of the nation. The blood poured upon the dry ground in Egypt, and the result thereof, pictured how the policies and methods of commercialism have deluged the nations of the earth with blood shed in violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant, and hence the death-dealing influence upon the peoples. (Gen. 9:1-6) For this reason commercialism as a part of Satan’s organization is doomed to complete destruction. What Jehovah has been doing thus far is to have his testimony declared to the rulers and to the people, to show them that commerce, as well as other parts of Satan’s organization, is without power to give life and blessings to the people. His witnesses are now doing their part in declaring this testimony of Jehovah, and later Jehovah, by his executive officer Christ Jesus, will destroy the entire organization of the enemy.—See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, pages 26-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Note that the expressed purpose of fulfilment of the first and third signs is that the rulers and the people may receive notice; ‘‘Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am [Jehovah].” This is further proof that Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to declare the testimony of Jehovah until every part of Satan’s organization shall go down. They have already shown their understanding and appreciation of this fact in a large degree. In these days seldom, if ever, does anyone of the anointed now say: ‘‘How much longer must the witness work continue ? ’ ’ The anointed of Jehovah that remain faithful are in the service of Jehovah for ever, and the present work is the bearing of testimony; and when that is completed they will engage in other work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERN MAG I CI A.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ns</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> As Pharaoh the Devil’s representative was supported by his magicians, even so now the Devil and his representatives on the earth, who attempt to counteract the effect of the testimony of Jehovah. ‘‘And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them ■ as the Lord had said. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.” (Ex. 7:22,23) The clergy magicians of Satan’s organization make the waters of truth to appear bloody by teaching the rulers their allies, and the people that will listen to them, that the business depression and suffering upon the people is a punishment from God sent upon them because of their unfaithfulness in supporting religious systems. To this effect the pope recently made a public statement, and millions of people are induced to believe such false statement. The result is what Satan desires, namely, the turning of the people away from God. The clergy and the other allies in wrongdoing now display their hardness of heart by crying out that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a commercial enterprise of selling books for pecuniary profit, and that by going from house to house to give the testimony and doing this without obtaining a license from worldly authority these witnesses are violating the commercial laws of the land. In this manner the modern magicians attempt to turn the waters of Jehovah’s testimony, now being delivered by his witnesses, into that which is death-dealing. Jehovah’s witnesses serve the rulers with notice which is Jehovah’s testimony that their commerce, as well as all other parts of the worldly organization, will shortly be destroyed by the Lord. The political magicians cooperating with their allies threaten the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and their work, and declare that it is a menace and hence death-dealing to the people. Big Business magicians are now desperately trying to work magic before the Devil. They claim that there are regular periods of depression and prosperity, and that business moves in cycles, and that within a short time now the depression will move on and that great prosperity will come again; hence they have sent forth the expression commonly heard: “Prosperity is just around the corner, and will soon be present.” The claim of big business is that these financial depressions are necessary evils (symbolized by blood) and will ultimately result in good. Every part of Satan’s organization discredits Jehovah and his kingdom, while Jehovah’s witnesses continue to tell the people that the kingdom of God is the only hope of mankind. The commercial, political and religious elements of Satan’s visible organization attempt to prove to the people that they have power to rule and to remedy the present evil conditions, and they thus continue to cast reproach upon Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DIGGING FOR WATER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> All of the rulers of the earth, big business, politicians and clergy, and those that support them are now desperately digging for ways and means to sustain their organization and to pull them out of the hole. This was particularly foreshadowed by what the Egyptians did, as it is written: “And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.” (Ex. 7: 24) The world is full of unemployment, and men in every commercial enterprise are desperately seeking if they can find the means to sustain life. Since the beginning of the financial depression in 1929, many makeshifts have been brought forward by the wise or magicians of the world in their efforts to dispel the depression, which has resulted from the bloody waters of commerce. These schemes or plans consist cf moratoriums, reconstruction, finance corporations ostensibly organized to help the people, but in fact to keep the head of Big Business above the waves, that it may survive and not die; conferences are held by the representatives of nations, coalition governments organized, and divers and numerous suggestions made as to how water that is now blood or death-dealing may be made pure and life-sustaining. Among the latest things that have been brought forward is that satanic scheme of “technocracy”, which offers a new system to replace the world’s worn-out economic machinery. The new system suggests that nobody work more than two hours a day and everybody would be happy and comfortable. Of course, this is a pure delusion, as Jehovah’s witnesses well know. Other schemes or plans advanced are such as campaign of buying, tax-sales law, repeal of prohibition, the manufacture and sale of beer, and the hypocritical scheme known as ‘ ‘ The National Economy League ’ ’. All these things, of course, ignore Jehovah God and give no heed to the repeated proclamations of truth that the present depression is the result of the end of Satan’s world, and that he has forced this condition upon the world for the purpose of turning the people away from Jehovah, and that the only sure and adequate remedy for mankind is the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESS WORK CONTINUES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Jehovah is in no manner responsible for the trouble that the world is now experiencing. The turning of the waters of the Nile into blood was not Jehovah’s curse upon the waters, nor did it illustrate or picture his curse upon the nations now. Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt for the expressed purpose of bearing his testimony before the rulers and the people to show them that he is the Almighty God, the Most High over all the earth. The signs performed before Pharaoh were for that very purpose, that Pharaoh and his organization might know that Jehovah is God, and might let the people go to God’s mountain. The testimony of Jehovah now being delivered by his witnesses is not God’s curse or expression of his wrath, but rather notice for the information and warning of the rulers and the people that Jehovah is God, that Satan’s time is at an end, and that Satan’s schemes are death-dealing, and that if Satan does not relinquish his power to rule Jehovah will shortly destroy his organization. As Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and God permitted him to remain in power for a time, even so now Jehovah permits Satan’s wicked organization to continue for a short period that he may in due time show to all that he is the Almighty God, and that his witnesses may proclaim this great truth to the world. “And in very deed for this cause have I [caused thee to remain], for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font4"> The testimony given to the rulers of the world shows that Jehovah is against Satan and his organization and hence all the schemes of Satan spell death to mankind. “And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the river.” (Ex. 7:25) Smiting the waters of Egypt was the first of the ten plagues that came upon that land. The “seven days” seem to picture that the deliverance of Jehovah’s testimony by his witnesses will continue steadily from that time forward until such work is completed, and that, when it is completed, then Jehovah will take a hand by sending his army under Christ into the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and that such will result in the complete destruction of Satan’s world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses have understood and believe the signs, and have wholly separated themselves from Satan’s organization and now refuse to “go down to Egypt for help”. They now see that Jehovah has sent Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, to the temple for judgment and to make a name for Jehovah. Corresponding to this, Jehovah gave Isaiah a vision at his temple. Then he cleansed Isaiah and sent him forth to bear his testimony. The prophet there pictured Jehovah’s witnesses serving notice upon the people of Satan’s world, and to whom Jehovah has said: “Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.” (Isa. 6:10) When Isaiah (Jehovah’s witnesses) asked the Lord how long they shall continue to bear this testimony the answer of Jehovah was: “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The witness work now in progress, which is the delivering of the testimony of Jehovah, must continue and progress. It is for the purpose of vindicating Jehovah’s name. Satan’s forces continue to put hindrances in the way of Jehovah’s witnesses. The anointed are now in unity with Christ under their victorious Leader, and they go into action with complete confidence as to the result. They expect opposition from the enemy, and the Lord has shown them how to meet that opposition. Organized and in full unity and moving </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font4"> upon a town, they give the testimony to the great discomfort of Satan’s representatives. This method of giving the witness has been greatly blessed by the Lord, thus showing his approval. His witnesses, both by word of mouth and by consistent course of conduct, bear testimony before men and angels that they are on the side of Jehovah, and are maintaining their integrity toward him, and that by his grace they will have a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> A revelation of these truths is of great comfort to the remnant at this time. They now see and appreciate that the name of Jehovah and the vindication thereof is the greatest of all things. Joyfully they have received and appreciate the name that Jehovah has bestowed upon them, and, although hard pressed by the enemy, they run into the strong tower of Jehovah and are safe. (Prov. 18:10) The remnant are wholly devoted to the kingdom of Jehovah which will vindicate his name; therefore they continue to exalt his name and sing forth his praises. Their faith is strong, their courage is high, and their battle cry is; “The sword of Jehovah and his kingdom!”</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CONSPIRACY AGAINST CHRIST’S LIFE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">F</span><span class="font4">ROM the very beginning of Christ’s public ministry on earth the Jewish clergy were against him. Their opposition finally turned to the condition of murderous hatred, and on numerous occasions they sought to lay hands on him; but Jesus’ time to be delivered over into their hands had not come. Finally toward the close of three and a half years of intense public witnessing for Jehovah God and of doing good to the common people Jesus’ time did come. His miraculous act of restoring his friend Lazarus to life, instead of convincing the Jewish clergy, exasperated them beyond measure, and they fully determined that they must get rid of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They now determined to go to the ruling factors of the country and show them that their country was in danger (?) because of this man Jesus, and that unless something be done they would lose their property and their right to hold office. Where selfishness is the moving cause others of like selfish interests are easily drawn into a compact. Satan was the god of the world. The financial, political and ecclesiastical factors were his. Now he needed but to hold before their eyes the danger of losing the things that they cherished, in order to induce them to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.”— John 11:47-53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The passover season drew nigh and everybody expected Jesus to come up and observe the passover, because he kept the law in spirit and in letter. Knowing this the clergy, under the supervision of Satan, began to prepare to take Jesus: “Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.”—John 11: 57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But some may here ask: Why recount all these terrible things that the clergy of that time did, and liken them unto the clergy of the present time ? What good can be accomplished by that? The answer is that the purpose in so doing is not to injure any man. It is not the purpose to hold men up to ridicule. No real good can come from resorting to such a course. The real purpose is to prove to the reasonable mind that the enemy of God and of Christ, and of the people who desire righteousness and truth, is Satan the Devil; that he is the one who has arranged the wicked schemes and conspired to hold the people in subjection to him through selfish and wicked men; that he is the one who has planted selfishness in the hearts of human creatures; and that to accomplish his purposes he has united the commercial, political and ecclesiastical elements in a compact of self-interest that he may carry on a government of the people contrary to God’s way. All the remedies offered by men have failed because they have all been interfered with by Satan, either directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, it is the purpose here to show that the remedy that will bring about relief to the people is the remedy of God, and none other; and that in due time God’s remedy applied for the benefit of the people will bring complete deliverance and the blessings which the people so much need and desire. When the people see that the clergy are the tools of the Devil, even as the Pharisees were when Jesus was on earth, the power of the clergy to deceive the people will be broken, and having the eyes of their understanding opened the people will be able to see God’s remedy and to put themselves in a proper attitude of mind and heart to receive the blessings when they are ministered unto them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose, therefore, in stating these things, and in showing the operation of God’s purpose and the opposition by the Devil, is for the benefit of mankind; that the people may see who is their real enemy and who is their real friend. A real friend is one who loves you all the time. (Prov. 17:17) And it will be found by studying the operation of Jehovah’s purpose that in everything God has manifested his love for the people and upon every occasion. The time has come for God'to establish his name in the minds of the people, not for his benefit, but for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But why should God permit the Devil to persecute his beloved Son and use the religious teachers of that time to aid him in that wicked persecution? The answer to that is: God knew that Satan would kill Jesus at the very first opportunity unless he should prevent it. He knew that the hypocritical religious leaders of that day, who had already proved unfaithful to him and unfaithful to their trust, would be the willing tools of the Devil to accomplish his wicked ends. Jesus had plainly told them that the Devil was their father. He was not trying to keep them in the dark. He was trying to help them. They claimed to be the representatives of God. Jesus was telling them: ‘If you were of God my Father, then you would do his works; but since you do the works of the wicked one, you prove that you are from him.’ God was permitting the religious leaders to have a great test, and under this test they failed. In other words, they failed and refused to follow and obey Jehovah God, but followed and obeyed the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God could have prevented the persecution of his beloved Son, but his wisdom dictated otherwise. It was necessary for Jesus to learn obedience by the things that he suffered under adverse conditions. He also must have a test, and when the test was laid upon him he met it in every way.—Heb. 5: 8, 9; Phil. 2:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God arranged to put a test upon Adam as a perfect man before he could grant him everlasting life. Adam failed under that test. God had permitted a test to come to the religious leaders of Jesus’ time, and they failed. Jesus was now a man, and before him was set the greatest prize in the universe. It was the purpose of God that his Son should also be tested before being granted this great prize. Jesus met the test and won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now it is due time for the people to see and to understand the truth; and particularly to see that all the warfare amongst themselves, the conflicts between religious systems, and the crimes and wickedness that stalk about in the earth, all these unrighteous things originated with Satan, who has used these agencies to turn the minds of the people away from God. The time is here for the people to see that God is their Friend and Benefactor. Let each one put out of his mind for all time that there is here any attempt or desire to array one class against another. But the truth must be set forth in contrast with the wicked one and his wicked course, in order that the people may know that Jehovah is God, that his beloved Son is the Christ, and that the Lord has outlined a way to life and there is none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time came when Jesus must offer himself formally to the Jews as their king. This must be done on the tenth day of Nisan, just preceding the passover feast, because it was the purpose of God that it should be done. In fulfilment of the prophecy of Zechariah (9.9,12) Jesus, seated upon an ass, rode into the city of Jerusalem. It was the custom of kings to ride on an ass when coming to be crowned as king. The fame of Jesus had now spread throughout Palestine. Many people believed on him. Great multitudes gathered by the way and laid down their garments in the road, cut down boughs from the trees and put them in the way for Jesus to pass over, thus representing their acceptance of him; and the people cried out unto him: “Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest!”—Matt. 21:1-9; John 12:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This great outburst of spontaneous applause from the common people made the blood of the Pharisees boil, and the Devil saw to it that fuel was added to the flame of anger. Now the Pharisees quickly called a council of blood. “The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold, the world is gone after him.”—John 12:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days later was the passover. As one who kept the law perfectly, Jesus celebrated this passover. While eating it with his disciples great sorrow came upon him, and he said to them: ‘ ‘ One of you shall betray me.” In an undertone Jesus, speaking to the beloved disciple John, said to him in substance: ‘Watch the one to whom I hand the sop when I dip it in the dish; he is the one that will betray me.’ Then Jesus handed the bread to Judas: “And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.”—John 13:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What could be meant here by the expression: “After the sop Satan entered into him”? Surely it meant that from that moment Satan had full possession of the mind of Judas, and now Judas was bent on carrying out his wicked purpose. This is positive proof that the Devil was really the one seeking the death of Jesus, because he knew Jesus was the Son of God and he desired to get rid of him in order that he might keep control of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Judas hurried away to meet his coconspirators, into whose hands he had agreed to betray Christ Jesus for the paltry sum of thirty pieces of silver. (Matt. 26:15,16) Of course Judas also knew that Jesus was the Son of God; but he had permitted bitterness to spring up in his heart, and now he was anxious to carry the conspiracy out and anxious to have some selfish profit. He got the money and then joined the mob and led them to Jesus. With that hypocrisy which had its conception and birth with the Devil, and its manifestation on a former occasion in the days of Enos the grandson of Adam, Judas now approached the Lord Jesus and kissed him and by this sign indicated to the mob that he was the one to be taken. Jesus did not resist the mob, but, yielding to them, was led away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mock trial of the Lord and his cruel death on a criminal’s tree followed in short order.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>GOVERNMENT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, WHEN?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE year nineteen-fourteen marked a great turning point in the world’s history, as is now well recognized by every observing person. More than twenty-five centuries ago God, in his Word, caused record to be made of prophecies pointing out the very things which have taken place during our lifetime and that now stand as unmistakable markers of the great change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah fixed the “times of the Gentiles” and thereby indicated the time of the end of Satan’s rule. For many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world; not by right, but by permission or sufferance of Jehovah. It follows that when God’s time should arrive to set his Anointed One upon his throne such time would mark the end of Satan’s rule by permission. Knowing that the Devil is the opponent of God, which is indicated by his name Satan, it is certain that Satan would not abdicate willingly, but would be ousted by the Lord. Of course Jehovah could oust Satan and destroy all of his power instantly, but that does not seem to be God’s way of doing his work. The facts show that while the ouster proceedings are in progress God is doing some special work with his anointed and gives notice to the nations of the earth concerning his purposes. With Jehovah everything proceeds orderly and in order. It will be found from the evidence that the ouster proceedings against Satan began in 1914 and that the work is still progressing. That work must progress until God’s government of righteousness for man is fully and completely established in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All peoples or nations aside from Jews are designated in the Scriptures as Gentile or heathen. The reason for this is that the Jews, or Israelites, were God’s people and over them he was the Ruler. When God permitted the Gentiles to overthrow Zedekiah, Israel’s last king, there the Gentiles or non-Jews began universal reign, and from that time the “Gentile times” began to count. The date of the overthrow of Zedekiah is positively fixed by the Scriptures and also by profane history as 606 B.C. It was in that year that Satan became the god of the entire world, that is to say, the invisible ruler over all the nations of the earth. It follows then that the end of the “Gentile times” would also mark the beginning of the time when Satan would no longer be permitted to rule without interference. It becomes important to fix definitely by competent proof the period of the Gentiles, which Jesus called “the times of the Gentiles”. (Luke 21:24) There are two lines of direct evidence corroborative of each other, and there is one line of circumstantial evidence which also corroborates the direct evidence, as to “the times of the Gentiles”. All three show that “the times of the Gentiles”, or period of the Gentiles, ended with A.D. 1914. That date therefore fixes the time of the end of Satan’s rule, and from that time forward interference with his rule is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One line of this testimony relates to the punishment of Israel, which began 606 B.C. and must continue for a period of “seven times”. Repeatedly the Israelites broke God’s covenant with him and were punished therefor. (Judg. 3: 14; 4: 2, 3; 10: 7, 8; 13: 1) Jehovah warned the Israelites that if they persisted in breaking their covenant he would punish them “seven times more”, or seven times additional to what he had already punished them. “And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.”—Lev. 26: 17,18, 31, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through his prophet Ezekiel God also recounted the many experiences of Israel and his determination to punish Israel for its disobedience. (Ezek. 20:1-39) God’s final decree against Israel was stated through his prophet in these words: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the erown; this shall not be the same; exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.”—Ezek. 21: 24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Zedekiah was then the king of Israel. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. (2 Chron. 36: 9-11) “And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.” (Jer. 39: 2, 6, 7) Zedekiah began his reign in the year 617 B.C.; and eleven years thereafter, to wit, in the year 606 B.C., he was taken prisoner and carried away to Babylon and the nation of Israel fell. That was the exact time of the enforcement of God’s decree against Israel. That date, to wit, 606 B.C., fixes beyond doubt the beginning of the universal Gentile rule which is called the “Gentile times”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A “time”, as used in the Scriptures, has reference </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> a year, whether it be used literally or symbolically. A symbolic time is reckoned according to the lunar year of 360 days. Therefore a symbolic year or time would mean a period of 360 literal years. (Ezek. 4: 6) “Seven times,” as used in the Scriptures, would therefore, if literal, mean seven literal years; and if symbolic it would be seven times 360 years, or a total of 2,520 literal years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures show clearly that the “seven times” of punishment upon Israel must be considered as symbolic, and not literal. Israel had previously suffered punishment for a longer period than seven literal years. (Judg. 3: 8,14) The Jews were actually in Babylon seventy years; and after they returned from Babylon they continued to suffer punishment at the hands of other nations and people. It must be concluded that the period of time referred to is symbolic time. That period of punishment which began 606 B.C., and continued seven symbolic times or 2,520 years, would end in 1914 (A.D.). The physical facts show that the beginning of the war in A.D. 1914 greatly enthused the Jews to get back into their own land. But that year 1914 is more significantly marked than this. In that your “Jerusalem, which is above,” and which is God’s organization, gave birth to the symbolic man child, the kingdom of God under Christ. —Rev. 12:1-5; Gal. 4:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another line of direct testimony relates to the experiences of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and God’s prophet Daniel gave the interpretation of that dream. (Dan. 4: 1-28) The fact that the inspired prophet of God gave the interpretation, and that the record thereof is so carefully made in God’s Word, shows that it was the purpose of God to record it for the benefit of those true Christians who would be on the earth at the time of the end and who would then have the privilege of understanding the meaning thereof, and that such understanding would be for the encouragement and comfort of Christians. (Rom. 15: 4; 1 Cor. 10: 11) In giving the interpretation the Prophet Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar: “They shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.”—Dan. 4: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan was the god or invisible ruler of all the world, and Nebuchadnezzar was the first emperor of that world power. God caused Daniel to refer then to all the world powers, to wit, Babylon and those that followed after, under the symbol of “wild beasts”. (Dan. 7: 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> The governments symbolized by “wild beasts” were to continue without interruption until the coming of God’s Anointed One. (Dan. 7: 13,14) That which the Prophet Daniel foretold in the interpretation of the dream was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar: &quot;All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.” He was driven into the field and lived like a beast for seven years. Those seven years of time were symbolic of the entire period of time that Satan’s world powers should continue without interruption. The experiences of Nebuchadnezzar symbolically represented that the nations of the earth, under their invisible ruler Satan, would be beastly until the time when the people would recognize the government of the Most High. This is indicated by the words of the prophet: “And seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.” Otherwise stated, the vision or dream was this: The Gentile dominion will be beastly and it will be under the supervision of Satan for a period of seven times and until the time of the beginning of the kingdom of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Gentile times”, as above stated, began with Nebuchadnezzar, in the year 606 B.C. “Seven times” or 2,520 literal years would cause the “Gentile times” to end in the year 1914 (A.D.). That, then, would mark the time when he whose right it is should take the power granted to him as the great Executive Officer of the Most High and when he would begin to exercise his power and authority for the overthrow of Satan’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two lines of testimony that agree as to the length of the “Gentile times”. “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.” (Deut. 19: 15) Jehovah thus stated the manner of the proof of any important matter. In addition to the direct testimony God further provides circumstantial evidence, which evidence is stronger, if possible, than the direct testimony above mentioned.—Matt. 24:1-33.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>PERSECUTION OF THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE WITNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE nation of Israel was a typical nation, that is, a nation whose experiences and God’s dealings with whom were prophetic foreshadowings of things to come in a later age. To them God had given the law through the Prophet Moses, which law performed the function of a schoolmaster to lead that people unto Christ. The Apostle Paul sets forth this view in his letter to the Galatians, the third chapter and twenty-fourth verse. The word here rendered “schoolmaster” is from the same Greek word as that from which our English word “pedagogue” comes, and originally meant one who would lead the children to school and care for them. The law performed this function toward Israel. In the year twenty-nine (A.D.) Christ had now come. The Jews had been shielded by the Lord God as a nation until the time of the last independent Jewish king, Zedekiah, and even since then all those Jews’ who returned to Jerusalem from captivity in Babylon and who showed faith in God had likewise been shielded. Had the nation accepted the Lord Jesus as their king they would have been transferred from their covenant toward God with Moses as mediator, over to Christ the Greater-than-Moses; and all the royal family of the new kingdom of God would have been selected from amongst the Jews. The Jews were therefore looking for the time to set up a kingdom, and those who really believed in Jesus were anxious to take him and make him king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan the enemy was ever on the alert to find some means whereby he might put Jesus to death. He soon found some ready tools to be used for his wicked purpose. The religious leaders of Israel, made up of the scribes, Pharisees and priests, doctors of the rabbinic law, et cetera, were these ready instruments. They were anxious to hold the common people subject to them. They were extremely selfish, even as their counterparts today are extremely selfish. Satan knew that it would be an easy matter to array these religious leaders against Jesus. With malicious hatred deeply rooted in their hearts he knew that he would find a way for them to bring Jesus before the financial and political factors of the government, charge him with disloyalty or treason, and thereby succeed in having him put to death, and that in an apparently legal manner. He set about to carry this scheme into operation. He injected into the minds of the Pharisees wicked thoughts against Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the ministry of Jesus the Pharisees and other members of the clergy began to take issue with him. They diligently sought to find some way to accuse him and his disciples of a breach of the law. These Pharisees were sticklers for the letter of the law, but the spirit of it they ignored. Even so it is today among the clergymen. For instance, they insist upon having a prohibition law upon the statute books, yet they avail themselves of the opportunity to take a drink when the occasion affords; and some of them find a way to stock their cellars with the forbidden stuff. The purpose of calling attention to this here is to show that Satan has ever made inconsistent all those whom he can control. Deception is one of the Devil’s chief methods of operation. He makes one thing appear to be accomplished, while he is really doing the very opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the Pharisees saw the disciples of Jesus plucking corn (or wheat) on the sabbath day that they might eat, the pious souls who stood for the letter of the law vigorously protested that the acts of the disciples were in violation of the law. Jesus tried at the time to teach them the spirit of the law; that the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath. But they were not willing to hear. When Jesus healed a sick man on the sabbath day the pious Pharisees were greatly angered. They immediately took counsel together as to how they might put Jesus to death. (Matt. 12: 14) Malicious murder had been planted in their hearts by the Devil, and now they were willing to carry it into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On another occasion Jesus spoke a parable in the presence of the scribes and Pharisees to this effect: •’There was a certain householder, which planted a \ineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But, last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet. ’ ’—Matt. 21: 33-39, 45, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan was really the one who desired to kill Jesus. He knew that Jesus was the heir of the promise that God had made to Abraham. He was using his invisible power to cause the Pharisees to bring about Jesus’ death. He was now making some progress. But it was not yet God’s due time to permit this to happen. Jesus knew what was in their minds, and that is why he spoke the parable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On another occasion Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God. Satan’s emissaries the clergy, on the pretext that this was blasphemy, again sought Jesus’ life for this offense. We read: “For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” “But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.”—John 3: 34-36; 5: 17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was really no excuse for the Pharisees to permit the Devil to overreach them. They knew that God had by precept and by pictures foreshadowed the coming of the Messiah. They knew that the time was due for him to come. In fact, they knew that Jesus was the One. But because of selfishness in their own hearts, and with a desire to hold power over the people, they were ready tools of the Devil; and he took advantage of them. Of course, Jesus knew that Satan was back of it all, and knew that these men were seeking his life. They did not deceive him for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On another occasion he said to them: “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed: but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceedeth forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you eonvinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.”—John 8: 37-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this occasion Jesus plainly told these men that the Devil was their father, that he was back of them, that they were carrying out Satan’s purposes, and that they were seeking the life of the Son of God because they were from the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Satan the Devil was the real one who was arranging to bring about the death of Jesus there cannot be any doubt. Jesus knew that; he knew that the Devil was using the clergy and that through them he was preparing Judas to carry out his purpose. Speaking in the synagogue, in the presence of his disciples and others, Jesus said: “As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.”—John 6: 57,58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many who had followed Jesus up to that time turned aside and followed him no more. “Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. ’ ’ —Jolin 6: 67-71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was not at all being deceived. He knew that he was carrying out his Father’s purposes, and he knew what would be the result. Straight forward and onward he went with his work. He continued to minister unto the needs of the poor, healing the sick, opening the eyes of the blind, making the lame walk and raising the dead. The exercise of Jesus’ great power in the raising of Lazarus from the dead furnished the Devil with an opportunity to stir up the clergy again. They were now to the point of frenzy and were anxious to act. Now was the opportune time for the clergy to draw into the conspiracy their allies, the financial and political factors of the government. This they proceeded to do, under the supervision of their overlord Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outcome of their action is known to all the world, both to angels and to men. And thus God’s “faithful and true witness” endured the most bitter persecution on earth and at the hands of enemies visible and invisible, and through it all he maintained fealty and integrity to his God and King, to the eternal praise of Jehovah the Host High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IS THE LORD’S ARM SHORTENED?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pk.vr Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For some time the three of us who are engaged in the pioneer work have talked of writing to you and expressing our appreciation of your personal interest in the pioneers. We wish to thank you for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font3"> that you sent to us. We lifted our hearts to Jehovah in thanksgiving for the wonderful results of the witness work as given to us in the Fear </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Book.</span><span class="font3"> It is our desire to continue m this work until Armageddon, which must be very near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your letter to the pioneers under the date of November 4 showed us your personal interest in the pioneers. You said: “Some of the pioneers state that they are finding it difficult to meet their expenses, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and this gives us much concern. ’ ’</span><span class="font3"> This </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">last </span><span class="font3">part of the sentence showed us that our difficulties are </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font3">yours. We want to thank you for the arrangement that lias been made to keep the pioneers in the field and for the credit slips sent to us, but we have not had to use these slips yet, and will not until it is absolutely necessary. Others who are in need may thus have help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You also said: “Others think they should return to some worldly avocation. ” As all pioneers should do, we go to all places of business and homes. There are very few who are making expenses in any line of endeavor; so why should any pioneer expect to leave the most important work in the world and be able to make expenses at something else. Is the Lord’s arm shortened? By no means; and although it seems dark at times, yet he has supplied us with the necessities thus far, and, above all, the peace that can come only through doing his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We daily remember you m prayer and wish to extend to you our love, which is very deep because of your fearlessness in proclaiming the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren in the witness work,</span></p>

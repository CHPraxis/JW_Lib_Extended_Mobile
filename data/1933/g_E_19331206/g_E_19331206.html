<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>“ Editorials ” on Religious Tolerance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE only thing necessary to be an editor of some publications is to have a vacuum above the ears into which at stated times quantities of bean soup may be poured as needed. If the soup is too warm it may be chilled slightly before being poured in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Monday, October 30, 1933, the following “Editorial” appeared in the San Francisco </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News.</span><span class="font8"> The next morning the same “Editorial” appeared in the Olean </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald, </span><span class="font8">Olean, N. Y., three thousand miles away. The Olean editor indicated that the soup was slightly fermented, because, uneasily, he added the words “Mark of Democracy” after the other two words that go to make up the title.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also, he had a better proofreader than the “Editor” in San Francisco. It will be observed that that worthy gentleman, in the tenth paragraph, intimates that “there is no sign that a revival of tolerance threatens us”. That is the absolute truth, but that was not the way the sentence appeared on his propaganda sheet, and the San Francisco man will probably be fined for not noticing that he said “tolerance” where he was supposed to say “intolerance”. Blunders in reprinting propaganda are inexcusable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Olean “Editor” beat the San Francisco man to it in another way. As an evidence of superior brain power, not only did the Olean man add three words to the title of the “Editorial”, but he actually inserted four asterisks in two different places in the body of the “Editorial”, once after the fifth paragraph and once after the eighth paragraph. In every other respect the two “Editorials” are alike, word for word, to the last punctuation mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the next three months a Protestant minister, a Catholic priest, and a Jewish rabbi will tour the United States together, to preside in 37 cities at interdenominational discussions of religious tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nothing has happened in this country recently to indicate that any revival of religious intolerance is to be feared. But it has had a fearful flare-up across the ocean, and of all menaces to the peace of mankind it is one of the most contagious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This tour can be looked on as a kind of vaccination, and it can be made an exceedingly valuable thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Full religious tolerance is one of those blessings whose true worth usually is not appreciated until they disappear. It is a comparatively new thing in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Its roots have not sunk as deeply into the substratum of civilized society as might be wished. If it is to be preserved, we must be eternally vigilant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We need to realize, too, that it is one of the essential ingredients in the democracy which we cherish. As the first nation to make a go of democracy, we have an especial reason for defending it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Democracy is more than just the abolition of autocratic government. In its broad sense, it is a scheme of society under which each individual is permitted to live his own life as he sees fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He not only has his vote, and his free and unchallenged choice of occupation; he has the right to worship as he pleases, and to do it without suffering the slightest discrimination, in any form, because of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any infringement on this right is a denial of the very essence of democracy. A democracy must have full religious tolerance, because of the simple fact that the moment it ceases to do so it ceases to be a democracy. All Americans who think their democracy worth preserving automatically must be defenders of religious tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this is worth repeating these days, even though there is no sign that a revival of tolerance threatens us. Unbridled intolerance is aflame beyond the sea. There is in America, unfortunately, enough ignorance and prejudice to provide a feeding ground for it if embers should fly our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By reexamining the question now, and reaffirming our determination not to let intolerance get a foothold, we can strengthen the foundations of our free society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We cannot spend all our time examining all the propaganda that appears in the daily press, because, if we did, there would not be time to do anything else, or even to finish that. Newspapers are operated by men of wealth and used as smoke screens to help them rifle the pockets of the people. They are not interested in the people. Their constant aim is to conceal the truth about God’s kingdom and to prevent the people from ascertaining just how evil and rotten the Devil’s kingdom really is. This so-called “Editorial” appeared as such in numerous other papers besides the San Francisco </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News </span><span class="font8">and the Olean </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald,</span><span class="font8"> and copies of the same have been received at this office. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is all </span><span class="font8">very disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now look for a moment at the barefaced lie put out by these three “Job’s comforters” that are touring the United States in the interest of hypocrisy. The statement appears, “Nothing has happened in this country recently to indicate that any revival of religious intolerance is to be feared.” Nobody could invent a worse lie than that.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Judge Rutherford on the Stand</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">“Judge Rutherford, have you been subjected to anv intolerance during the TIolv Year’ of 1933?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I have.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Name some of the incidents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In December the 'pope’ announced that 1933 would be a ‘Holy Year’. At that time my lectures on Bible themes, and particularly on The Kingdom of God, The Hope of the World, were being broadcast on upward of 300 radio stations, of which 25 were in Canada. As soon as the pope’s ‘Holy Year’ had been proclaimed, but even before it had actually begun, the Canadian censor, Hector Charlesworth (who is under Roman Catholic influence), without any law giving him the right so to do, and without any hearings, but solely on the complaints of clergymen, ordered those broadcasts to cease. This was done despite petitions of more than 400,000 names requesting that they be continued.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But that was in Canada. Were you subjected to any intolerance in the United States?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What intolerances have you noticed in the United States in 1933?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It has been the most intolerant year in American history, excepting only 1918. On April 16, 23 and 30 I broadcast over the United States three addresses on timely and important topics, ‘The Way of Escape,’ ‘Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity,’ and ‘Kingdom Blessings for the People’. Millions of people no doubt heard these addresses, for many thousands of them wrote to me about them, yet intolerance is so rooted and grounded in the Roman Catholic system that from that time to this all the power of the hierarchy has been used to force me off the air in the United States, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">number of stations were compelled, by threats of boycott, and other un-American methods, to discontinue broadcasts which I have abundant proof that the people themselves desired to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Do you know of any other instances in 1933 ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The year has been filled with them. In New Jersey some twenty-five towns under Roman Catholic control have thrown into prison men and women who were wholly within their rights in preaching the gospel from door to door. This was notably done at Summit and Plainfield. In the latter town fifty-six men and women were jailed for ten days each after farcical trials without a parallel in judicial history. This was while I was in Europe. On my return I lectured in Plainfield on this very subject of ‘Religious Intolerance : Why Practiced Now<sup>1</sup>, and the Roman Catholic police administration under Mr. Flynn had sixty armed men in the audience, covering me with machine guns and other weapons of intimidation, but the address was given, and broadcast all over New Jersey at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What, in your opinion, is the motive behind the sending of these three men all over the United States to tell the people there is now no intolerance in America?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“To lull the people to sleep, so that when their liberties are suddenly snatched away there will be no protest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Outstanding Libel of the “Holy Year”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil always practices fraud and deception to accomplish his wicked purposes, and inasmuch as the Catholic hierarchy are his visible representatives on earth, it is natural to expect that this institution -would and does resort to the same methods of fraud, lying and deceit to overreach the people that he has always found hitherto have so well served his ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an illustration of the wickedness of the Devil and his crowd we now invite our readers to consider the following statement which appears on page 1 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register,</span><span class="font8"> Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, October 19, 1933, Volume XXXIV, No. 7, column 4, top of column:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“WITNESSES OF JEHOVAH” HELD Thirty-one Eutherford Followers Arrested for Sedition in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arrest of sixteen men and thirteen women, members of an organization known as “Witnesses of Jehovah”, who had come to Quebec from Ontario and Montreal and flooded the city with anticlerical literature, was followed by the arrest of two more associates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of those arrested are reported to be affiliated with the “International bible Students”. They are being held charged with violation of Article 13-1 of the penal code in having taken part in a seditious conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah's Witnesses” is a term applied by “Judge” Joseph F. Eutherford, anti-Catholic and anti-clerical radio lecturer and ex-convict, to his followers in the International Bible Students’ Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of them, he wrote recently to the Catholic press of America as follows: “I know that already your hierarchy is seeking some apparent legal excuse to kill all of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The charge of sedition on which the ‘‘Witnesses” are held in Canada, is one of several on which .Rutherford himself was convicted during the World War and sentenced to twenty years in the penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His radio addresses, which created a storm of protest particularly in Kansas and Missouri during the past summer and lesulted in cancellations by most of the broadcasting stations handling them, have been barred from all Canadian stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In June of 1918, when the United States was engaged in the World War, Rutherford wrote to a follower who had refused military duty as follows: ‘‘to be shot for being a conscientious objector is a quick method of entering the presence of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let all the honest and fair-minded take note of the lies in the foregoing. The sedition with which Jehovah’s witnesses were charged in Canada was the distributing of a booklet exposing the fears of the Catholics concerning Purgatory. The Catholic hierarchy have used this blasphemous statement for years to defraud the people and obtain from them wrongfully money to carry on their wicked work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Being interested in the statement in the foregoing article describing Judge Rutherford as “anti-Catholic and anti-clerical radio lecturer and ex-convict” and having shared with him his experiences in 1918 (and hoping to share them throughout eternity) we called up one of the best lawyers in the United States, Frederick W. Sparks, of Brooklyn, N. Y., to see what he had to say on the subject, and this is what he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Replying to your telephone inquiry in reference to whether you are an ex-convict because of your conviction in the case of United States vs. Woodworth, ct al.: The reversal of the judgment of conviction by the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Government’s failure to retry you, leaves your status as if you had never been convicted, and to publish an article describing you as an ex-convict, in my opinion, is libelous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the strength of that opinion, and honestly desiring to see truth triumph in the earth, and the servants of the Devil get all that is coming to them, we profoundly and sincerely hope that Judge Rutherford will sue these people for libel, and push the case to the limit. Why let a bunch of lying, cowardly poltroons drag the name of the faithful and true for ever in the dust? A good lawsuit for about a million dollars damages against these Roman Catholic roosters that have so much to say about “Religious Tolerance” in the “Holy Year” would, it seems to us, be a good thing—and help to fumigate the “Holy Year” at that.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>How About a “Holy Year” for the Indians?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T OCCASIONALLY happens that an honest man gets into the Roman Catholic priesthood. The Reverend Peter Heuel, Burns, Oregon, seems to be such a man. In a conflict between a millionaire lumber firm and the Indians whom he had been teaching, he stood by the Indians and was summarily suspended for ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All efforts to get justice failed, but he did enlist the interest of a fellow priest, Joseph Schell, sick and bedfast in St. Anthony’s Hospital, Pendleton, Oregon. Joseph knows how to write and is writing some mighty interesting things to his superior officers. We select extracts from a series of printed letters which Reverend Schell is now circulating in leaflet form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First is a letter to the Most Reverend Archbishop Edward D. Howard, D.D., Portland, Oregon, dated August 22, 1932, in which Mr. Schell pays his respects to his archbishop and to his bishop, Joseph F. McGrath, Baker City, Oregon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our Lord received a blow in his face for having told the truth to the High Priest. St. John the Baptist lost his head for having told the truth. I fared better; the Archbishop A. Christie, your predecessor, with his fist to my face, said: “I’ll break your face if you do not keep your mouth shut” (regarding the land frauds). A priest in Seattle was kicked in the back by his bishop, O’Dea. Do you want moie facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judas, the first bishop worshiper of Mammon, betrayed and sold Truth and Justice—Our Loid—for money. Today, the followers of Judas are many, betraying and selling truth and justice for money. The Rev. Heuel’s case is an example. There are many such cases, to the disgrace of the church administration, which invites and defends such crimes. “Get the money, and all is well.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is little in law that appeals to the gold-ridden church dignitaries. Like Judas, they want money. Law to these worshipers of Mammon is the law of selfish power and aggrandizement. Their only concept of law, peace and government is an adjustment of affairs that will favor their vain and selfish ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems that Bishop McGrath himself is not without conscience. When the millionaires were after Heuel’s scalp he told Heuel of it and offered him another place, but Heuel stuck by the poor Indians, to do what he could to keep them from being despoiled. The sick man, Joseph Schell, knew all this, and so that the archbishop would realize that he did know of it, he wrote him again on November 25, 1932, with what the apostle would describe as “great plainness of speech”. Quotations are from his leaflet No. 2:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Rev. Heuel had evidence that his removal from Burns was wanted by Edward Hines, a multimillionaire, who could not deprive the helpless Indians of their rights and property as long as Heuel was with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, Mr. Hines had previously given to Cardinal Mundelein one million dollars, as a gift. For this, Rome had deeorated him with church titles of distinction and of nobility, like Commander of St. Gregory the Great, etc. Hines pressed Bishop McGrath hard, who was slow and hesitating. Then two spokesmen of Mr. Hines went to see the bishop. One of them testified that they asked for Rev. Heuel’s removal from Burns, or they would go higher up and get his (the bishop’s) removal. Then, the bishop suspended Heuel, ez </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">informata conscientia,</span><span class="font6"> for ten years, saying to Heuel that he did not know why he was suspended, that Rome was doing it, and that he must have recourse to Rome, but should avoid trouble for which he might be sorry. And also that it was useless to appeal to the apostolic delegate at Washington, T&gt;. C., who did not know anything of it. Had Hines bribed some cardinal in Rome to order Rev. Heuel’s ruin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time, I myself informed Bishop McGrath that he should have told Hines and his agents to go to hell with their money, just as St. Peter had told Simon the Magician, and not to sacrifice a priest upon the altar of Mammon at the request of Bines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Rev. Heuel appealed again and again, but was ignored everywhere. And two years later Rome referred his appeal to you for investigation and trial. It is the unwritten law of the church, that in order to uphold authority, an unjust bishop must win against a just and innocent priest. You are expected to put aside or piously pervert canon law, and call evil good, and good evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I would like to remind you that the Rev. Heuel must know the charges before he can defend himself. He must know and hear his accusers before he can probe the witnesses, if they were bought to testify; and how they are connected with Hines in business or otherwise; if there were charges before or after the suspension, or if Bishop McGrath was hiding his iniquity under the cover of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ex vnfor.mata conscientia.</span><span class="font6"> Remember, also, that in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">foro externo</span><span class="font6"> all things must be proven and unfolded in the presence of both contestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You must also know that Hines’ Lumber Co. at Burns and his interest in timber, including Indian rights, represents millions of dollars. Also, that the Hines New Townsite Co., near Burns, lias such investors as Cardinal Mundelein, heading the list with one hundred thousand dollais. The other investors are Catholic institutions like the Catholic University of Washington, D. C., religious orders of men and women and many priests, who have invested to the amount of over half a million dollars. And all this has been found in the files of the Hines New Townsite Co. This company has now gone bankrupt and the investors lost their money. All the property was sold by the sheriff on March 25, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Edward Hines had bribed the church with one million dollars, he expected the church to patronize him, and help and protect him in his business ventures. This the church did by investing money and by suspending Rev. Heuel. But this poor priest who had converted all the Indians there to the Catholic faith, refused to sell and betray the Indians. Hence this concerted action of Hines’ interests and the bribed church administration to crush the Rev. Heuel through suspension and starvation, an old priest of GO years. Such is the power of money with faithless church dignitaries, and such is actual church government by consecrated politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not seeming to get results, the man on the sick bed next tackled the “Holy Office” at Vatican City, and on March 12,1933, told them some things that must have made mighty interesting reading about the time the “Holy Year’' started. He said in part (we are still quoting from his leaflet No. 2):</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each bishop must pay to Rome a large sum of money for the favor of being made a bishop. Again, he must pay a large sum of money to Rome for his coveted transfer from a poor to a wealthier diocese. Again he must pay a large sum of money to Rome for being named an archbishop, and an enormous fortune for the title of Cardinal. The monsignors must pay to Rome large sums of money for their title and for permission to wear purple, and to strut around the bishop for a share of public admiration with the bishop. I heard bitter complaints by a bishop who had to buy Roman Bulls three times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Naturally, these pious-faced hypocrites, who follow and protect Mammon, cannot serve God in truth, justice and mercy, as seen in the Rev. Heuel case. They want absolute secrecy to protect their misdeeds, and want their hired cardinals to prevent any harm therefrom, by suppressing truth, and preventing justice, as seen in the Rev. Heuel case. And such is church government by consecrated hirelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to this general and official bribery in the church administration, there are more than two thousand tramp priests astray in America, as well as many members of religious houses of men and women. Today, I have been informed, that a priest of this Baker diocese has joined the ministry of the Episcopal church. Also, that a Franciscan father is about to become a bishop in the Episcopal church. Such are the wrecks found in the slimy trail of official corruption in our church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To be crucified one has only to preach the gospel to the high priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I invite contradiction, because it will help bring out more proofs about this damnable condition in the church administration, which banishes truth and justice for the protection of bribery and corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I also have helped the poor and the oppressed, and through it I came into conflict with their powerful oppressors, who bought the help of my bishop to get me out of the way. Thus I was betrayed and sold twice to predatory wealth by two bishops. First, by Archbishop Christie of Portland, Oregon, in the Oregon gigantic land frauds; and, second, by Bishop Scannell of Omaha, Neb., in the round-up of powerful Indian swindlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For years I had pleaded and appealed to the church administration for a hearing and redress, but all in vain. Then I went to Rome, where, for three months, I have studied and observed the prevailing conditions. There I saw and understood, that the church administration ruled according to money, and not according to truth and justice. Hence I know what I am writing about, and I can challenge contradiction. The cardinals ignore the Gospel and protect those offering gifts and bribes. They call it charity, and see to it that this unChristian charity covers all the sins and the misdeeds of the malefactors of whom they are the paid protectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After seven weeks from this date, if nothing is done for the relief of and satisfaction to Rev. Heuel, his case with all the letters will be printed and spread in Rome and over all America. Truth shall out, and the scandalized public, more conscientious than the faithless church dignitaries, will be heai d from. * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There seems to be nothing in our church, priests included, that Rome is not willing to sell or trade for gold, glory and political influence. But all in vain. The nations want no more church government nor anything like it in their state politics. They want no return to the middle ages, nor to church tribunals and their kind of justice; hence the worldwide separation of church and state. Centuries have shown that politics, wealth and vanity m our church government, while profitable to the consecrated church politicians, personally, are highly injurious to Christianity and humanity. If the church administration in Borne would be Christian and openly honest, in fact, there would be no Ileuel case, nor many others like it, nor their public scandals, nor worldly politics in the church. As Bome is, so are and must be the bishops and the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am in the hospital, sick and bedfast. Each morning I am lifted into a chair to say mass. As soon as I helped the Bev. Ileuel about his case, Bishop McGrath took steps to oust me from the Sisters’ Hospital, but without success. Then he deprived me of mass intentions, my only income for needs, sent to him through the Extension Society for priests in need. Such is my treatment in my physical helplessness, at the hands of a faithless bishop, because I am helping the Bev. Ileuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the course of his duties, the Bev. Heuel accidentally came across some exclusive lane of church graft. He was warned to keep away. He knew not how to be deaf, blind and dumb about it, and protected the helpless victims, the Indians he had converted to the Catholic faith. Then came from Bome a ‘ ‘ lettre de Cachet ’ ’ to Bishop McGrath, ordering him to put the Bev. Heuel out of the way for ten years, with suspension and starvation. Bev. Heuel complained and appealed. Then, two years later, an order came from Bome for a hearing of the case in the Metropolitan Court of Portland, Oregon, only to prove ‘ ‘ under the seal of absolute secrecy ’ ’ that the pious grafters in silk and ermine are right when doing wrong, and that Bev. Heuel in rough clothes and penniless is wrong when doing right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And such is actual church government which covertly frowns upon truth, justice and Christianity, and upholds pious graft as seen here. And thus priests must, either in silence, without the light of truth and the air of justice, live in a poisonous atmosphere that kills their faith and souls, or be ruined and starved without recourse. Not secrecy, but wholesome publicity is needed to stop official misdeeds and abuses, and the many evils and scandals therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We do not know that they need any hints from us, but for the benefit of the sisters that serve in St. Anthony’s Hospital, we explain that the approved method of popes for putting people out of the way that they wish to get rid of, without drawing any suspicion upon themselves, is to have the prisoner fed powdered diamond dust in his soup. Different from any other stone, this dust cuts into the small intestines and starts ulcers which do not heal. It takes about five months to kill a man by this method, but it is quite safe, and has been used many times in the church. AVell, good-bye, Joe; you were a good scout and deserved to live (and may, even yet).</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Do Something to Appease the Torturers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. Anselm Francis, S. A., spiritual director of the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement, St. Christopher’s Inn, Graymoor, Garrison, N. Y., is anxious that something should be done to stay the wrath of the torturers that are running this place called “purgatory”. He tells something of the infamous way they have of running this place, in the language of St. Theresa:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Methinks that a red-hot iron ball is going through my temples, that a fiery pike pierces me through from head to foot, and a burning dagger is piercing my heart from right to left; whilst my head is squeezed with a fiery helmet and constantly struck with a hammer. My bones are falling into dust, the marrow is dried up, each of my joints endures a special torment I can neither name nor describe.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That seems rather bad, but Fr. Anselm reassures us, for in the next breath he says that “God has been very good to us”. Maybe so, maybe so, but if He would do things like that ■when He was good, we hate to think what He ■would do if He ever once lost His temper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fr. Anselm goes more into details about the goodness. There were some beds to be endowed. Of these, 110 had been taken at $100 a bed; that is $11,000 to the good; isn’t that something? Of course, things are rather bad in “purgatory” ; that is to be admitted; but they are not so bad at Graymoor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More is wanted. There are 7 stained-glass windows that will set somebody back $125 apiece, 4 statues that, all together, will cost $525, 5 shrines or altars that, it is calculated, will wreck $6,500, and bells for the tower will mean another $750; but there is one nice thing about all this, and that is that these trimmings can all be paid for in installments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what Fr. Anselm really wanted to tell us about is “purgatory”. He asks, “Who would believe purgatory is as it is unless the saints said so?” And we answer, Nobody; and as far as we are concerned we don’t believe a word of it. That will be a disappointment to Fr. Anselm, for we know he would like to have us send in a few dollars to light some vigil lights for the poor souls in that place where they have a boss that shows such a dreadfully mean disposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Feeling that he had not said quite all he should about “purgatory” (for it is admitted that you never can sell anything unless you tell something about it, at least enough to make the people want it) Fr. Anselm proceeds to quote something said by ‘‘Father” Faber:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“St. Collette was wont on the feasts of martyrs to suffer the same tortures as they had endured; she felt herself roasted with St. Lawrence, flayed like St. Bartholomew and crucified like St. Peter. Sometimes it seemed to her that her limbs were broken with iron bars, or that her eyes were replaced by two burning lamps. This lasted for fifty years. Is this purgatory ? According to St. Augustine, it is only a shadow.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, it is none of our business, but it seems to us that the thing Fr. Anselm and all the other “purgatory” experts should give attention to is getting the one that runs this place to manifest a better disposition. But maybe Fr, Anselm feels that will come about naturally if the people will only just do the reasonable thing and come across liberally for his stained-glass windows, statues, shrines, bells and candles. He ought to know.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Bishop Hickey’s Funeral</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">TDishop Hickey, of Rhode Island, would, we think, be alive today if he had not busied himself interfering with the broadcasting of the truth by Judge Rutherford. The bishop went out in style, but he is as dead now as though he had never lived. He might better not have opposed the message of God’s kingdom, and remained alive, but he elected to oppose it, and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One account of the pitiful attempt of the Devil to draw some glory to himself even in the death of one of his tools says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There [in the cathedral] he will lie until the interment procession is begun after the pontifical mass Monday and the imparting of the five pontifical absolutions. The bishop is vested with cassock, sash, roche, amice, alb and cincture. His pectoral cross, which he would finger as he gave his sermons and public addresses, is resting on his breast. Over the alb are his stole and tunic with a dalmatic under the purple chasuble. His hands are gloved and he is wearing his episcopal ring over the gloves. He is wearing sandals and under his mitre is the zuchetto, a small cap. Although all the vestments are purple the mitre is white. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would seem as though anybody who had any sense ought to be able to see that that is all nonsense. The man is dead; the point of the matter is that, if he had not opposed the truth, he might still be alive, though we joyfully yield to the judgment of God, and believe it is better as it is, for he was God's enemy, though claiming to be His friend. His funeral was held “under a sunless October sky”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The account says that the news of his death “was flashed over the radio stations”. Those were the very radio stations that he caused to cancel their contracts and shut Judge Rutherford off the air. The judge may not speak over those stations, but the Lord may, enough to show His hand, and that is quite enough. We do not taunt; we state the facts; the man is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The stories of the bishop's death repeat over and over again that on the day he died “he was in apparent good health”. We believe that he was, and that he was put to death by one of the holy angels of God because he interfered with the proclamation of the truth in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It takes seven regular newspaper columns to merely list the names of the “most reverends”, “very reverends,” “reverends,” governors, United States senators, congressmen, majors, lieutenants, judges, state officials, chamber of commerce officials, doctors, city officials and other dignitaries that attended Bishop Hickey’s funeral, but we think he might better not have opposed Judge Rutherford’s work, and remained alive. However, he made his own choice, and is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Few People Endorse Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T IS very apparent that few people really endorse persecution. Thus, on October </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">22 </span><span class="font8">every house in the Roman Catholic city of Summit, N. J., was twice visited by Jehovah’s witnesses, and although seven were arrested and detained for a few hours, and although the newspapers claimed that police headquarters was deluged by complaints that the witnesses had been ringing their doorbells, yet not a person was willing to sign a complaint.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>A Protest and Petition to Congress</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Against Censorship and Domination of Radio in the United States by the Tope’ and Other Selfish Interests</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font8">UCH is being macle by the Roman Catholic press of the fact that the present occupant of the White House in Washington has done more to favor the aspirations of the papacy in America than any of his predecessors in fifty years. One of the items in their rejoicing is the appointment by President Roosevelt of a Knight of Columbus, James H. Hanley, a Nebraskan lawyer, as Federal Radio Commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the things expected of the new commissioner, by Catholics, is that he, as a loyal subject of the ‘pope’, should cleverly find some way to get Judge Rutherford off the air. This was plainly stated in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Citizen </span><span class="font8">(Milwaukee, Wis.), June 24, 1933, when that paper admitted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A formal protest will be macle shortly to the Federal Radio Commission requesting that Rutherford be denied the privilege of broadcasting his attacks on the clergy. The petition to the Commission is to be filed through the National Council of Catholic Men and the National Council of Catholic Women. Mr. Caravati of the N.C.C.M. has already had an informal discussion with Mr. Hanley of the Commission. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same item, with added details, appeared two days previously in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register, </span><span class="font8">of Kansas City. Therein it was indicated that the Bob Shuler (Los Angeles) case (discussed in our issue of March 1, 1933) would be used as an excuse and a precedent. Shuler had said some uncomplimentary things of the Roman Catholic church, and an associate justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia gave expression to the opinion, and stated, among other things, that Shuler had no right to “offend the religious susceptibilities” of others, and ruled his station off the air. Since -when, in America, did it become illegal for any person to offend the religious susceptibilities of another?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Allow that two men are cast away on an uninhabited isle and one of them says something that offends the religious susceptibilities of the other, what is going to happen? Which one must go and jump into the sea ? and why ? Which one must come and have his tongue cut out? and why? The judge who delivered himself of that opinion may be in full possession of his mental faculties, but he seems to us to be over-zealous to act as protector of the most tyrannical institution under the sun.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Hanley Under the Lash</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">And so Hanley, under the lash of the priests (and supposedly also of Amleto Giovanni Ci-cognani, archbishop and personal representative in the United States of Achille Ambrogio Damiano Ratti, ‘pope,’ of Vatican City), started in to try to “get” Judge Rutherford. It has not been easy going. Thus, under the headline “Less Than 100 Complained”, the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font8">November 26, 1933, made the interesting admission that though, for six weeks, Hanley (misprinted “Haney” in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times)</span><span class="font8"> solicited complaints from a nation of radio listeners, yet in that time he was unable to evoke even a hundred responses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An analysis of these responses shows that there w’as objection to “too much duplication of chain programs, too much offensive sales talk, too many programs tending to develop religious agitation and too much trafficking in radio facilities; also a tendency toward monopoly by certain groups”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That makes five kinds of complaints distributed among the “short” one hundred, so that, if we divide the number equally we have Commissioner Hanley’s admission that in the whole United States, in a period of six weeks’ agitation of the subject, he was able to find but about twenty people who thought there were “too many programs tending to develop religious agitation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the United States we have some 213 sects flourishing, and if we make a careful mathematical computation it appears that before each of these sects could have one chance to do some of this wholesome provocation of thought it would normally have to wait 447 days before it could stir up one person enough to make one complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under the circumstances lawyer Hanley only stultifies himself when he tries to screen the plain inference that the only reason why he is checking up on Judge Rutherford, and trying to get him off the air, is that he himself is a subject of the ‘pope’ and, in obedience to papal influence, and contrary to American policy, is trying to make America a closed preserve for the Roman Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shall the Radio Listeners Have a Square Deal?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford and his friends are tired of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">all this humbug. They, In common with others, have heard a great deal lately about Tolerance and the New Deal. If this New Deal means that our liberties are going to be taken away from us by a bunch of cheap politicians at the behest of the ‘pope’, then we are going to find it out, and find it out now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Protest and Petition is going in to Congress so that the representatives of all the people of this country, and not merely the one Roman Catholic representative on the Federal Radio Commission, will know what is going on and will have a chance to say something about it. Even as this is being written, the following is being placed in the homes of all the people:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF LIBERTY?</span></h4>

<p><span class="font7">NDER the pretext of “tolerance” that intrenched, selfish crowd is now engaged in a movement to force the radio stations to broadcast only what pleases them and to thus deprive the people of their just rights to hear the truth. They are trying to force off the air men who are faithfully telling the people God’s Word of truth concerning the cause of world distress and what is His remedy. Nothing could be of greater importance to you than to hear those truths now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True democracy is fast disappearing from the earth. In behalf of truth and righteousness you still have the opportunity to protest and petition. To enable you to exercise this right, a petition is now being circulated. It is of the greatest importance that you act quickly.

<p><span class="font8">The foregoing is the general invitation which is now going out in printed form to the American people to participate in the Protest and Petition which is now being circulated all over the country. Action in the matter will bo completed promptly—early in the year. The following is the form of the Protest and Petition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To THE CONGRESS of the United States of America: G rectings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, undersigned people of the United States of America, capable of determining for ourselves what we wish to hear broadcast by radio, without censorship by the clergy or anyone else, hereby PROTEST to the Congress against certain wrongful interference with our rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The radio act provides, as we understand, for the broadcasting of that which is in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The message of the true God, JEHOVAH, as expressed by Him in the prophecies of His Word (the Bible) and as now being given to the people of this nation by Judge Rutherford and others of JEHOVAH’S witnesses, is of interest to us. When broadcast, it is convenient for us to hear it in our homes and is necessary for our welfare. We are entitled to hear and desire to hear that message. We disapprove of every attempt to prevent our hearing it broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The National Broadcasting Company, the Columbia Broadcasting System, the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and others, have wrongfully by threats, coercion and other improper influence prevented many stations from broadcasting this message of truth, thus depriving stations of legitimate income and depriving millions of American citizens of the privilege of hearing ■what they wish to hear; and against this wrongful action we vigorously PROTEST.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exercising the right guaranteed to us by the Constitution of the United States, we therefore respectfully petition the Congress to act at once to safeguard the inherent rights of the American people relative to the radio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Mr. Lewis, district attorney of Luzerne county, was to have testified at the trial that he authorized the confinement of Morgan and 22 others on charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot, and did this over a telephone, without seeing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> which they distributed, and without any evidence that they had done anything unlawful. He was a candidate for reelection that fall and wanted to be sure of the Roman Catholic vote. He did not arrive in the courtroom until just after the case had closed. It is just as well; he was spared any incentive to commit perjury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Flannery, assistant district attorney of Luzerne county, was the counsel for the defendants. He let it be known, or surmised, that he had received his training at the Methodist Seminary at Kingston. Everybody thought he meant he had been trained to be a Methodist preacher, until, in the climax of his peroration, he eulogized the Roman Catholic church so ful-somely that he spilled the beans. His intimation was that he was defending the Methodists of the Roman Catholic town of Pittston against the attacks of the &quot;awful Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society people’. He carefully concealed the fact, and it was not even mentioned at the trial, that a Roman Catholic priest in Pittston was the inciter of the whole trouble. The original complaint came from him; it was a complaint from one Roman Catholic to another. At first the Pittston police department freely admitted this over the telephone. In fact, the officers acted, not as Americans, and without regard to law, but as and for the Roman Catholic church, which to them is the highest law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Langan, mayor of the city of Pittston, testified that when Jehovah’s witnesses distributed </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> gratis in his city on the afternoon of September 20,1931, they were also placing booklets with the people and receiving contributions therefor. As a matter of fact, while both these acts are strictly legal and proper, his sworn statement was false; no booklets were placed that day by anybody. Mr. Langan is a Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. O’Hara, the committing magistrate, testified under oath that all of the 23 Watch Tower people had confessed that they were guilty and had asked that they be confined in prison; he well knew that he was committing perjury when he gave such testimony. He is a Roman Catholic and proud of it. A poor unfortunate tool of the Roman hierarchy, when he was asked to point out under which section of the ordinance he had</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">authorized the arrests, he could not do so. After he had named one section on the witness stand he shifted to another, equally ridiculous.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Who Were the Riotous?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Reddington, patrolman, admitted that when Morgan asked him his name he had lied and said it was McGinness. Having lied so well to Morgan, he lied some more on the stand, lied when he said he saw Morgan giving out papers, lied as to the place where he seized him, and lied as to all the attendant circumstances. He is a Roman Catholic, no doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About eight more of the toughest-looking people one could imagine were put on the stand and testified, one after another, that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> had vilified the American Legion and certain other institutions, and to prevent a riot in the city they had rushed to police headquarters to have the plaintiffs locked up and the good name of the city saved. Each and all, they overlooked the fact that the American Legion is not mentioned in that issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> in any way, shape or manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thereupon the chief of police, Mr. Keating, went into action and caused the arrests. He admitted that he had seen no riotous conduct on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it was manifest from the testimony adduced that nobody else had seen such, and yet he cheerfully proposed to confine 23 men and women in jail thirty days on hearsay testimony and to hold them each on $1,500 bail on the charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot. He forgot to say that several of the defendants were arrested while sitting quietly in their automobiles, without any testimony whatever being adduced that they had done anything else, and that several were arrested who had merely driven to the police headquarters to inquire what had become of relatives and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It never seemed to have occurred to Mr. Keating that he should find out whether the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses was a lawful one, as indeed it was; but on the testimony of men who confessed that they were themselves on the point of committing illegal acts, he caused the arrest and confinement of the law-abiding and allowed the lawless, and admittedly lawless and disorderly Roman Catholic citizens, to go scot-free. In other words, as a Roman Catholic official, in a Roman Catholic town, he acted, not as an American, but as a Roman Catholic, flouting the law he had sworn to uphold.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>More Lies for the Jury</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout the three days of the trial it was drilled into the jury, over and over again, that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> was a terrible paper, an awful paper; that it not only attacked all organized religion, Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian (Catholic not mentioned, of course), but that it made wholesale onslaughts on the Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., Boy Scouts, and Salvation Army, besides the American Legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The papers took this up and heralded it all over Lackawanna county and Luzerne county— what a terrible sheet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> is!—and then Attorney McCaughey for the plaintiff, in his closing address, read all that the issue contained about the Y<sup>T</sup>.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., Boy Scouts and Salvation Army and endorsed it 100 percent. The story, if you look it up, is of where, at Virginia, Minnesota, the Community Chesters were short $6,000 in their funds and, instead of making each of the above-named social units bear a part of their disappointment, they kept the contributions to those institutions up to par and took the whole $6,000 out of the fund for the relief of the poor—a dirty trick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The jury did not know, and could not know, that that very morning, in the near-by Roman Catholic town of Swoyersville, for distributing that very paper, there was a plot in the home of the Roman Catholic burgess to waylay and murder five carloads of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The whole story of that eventful morning and afternoon is told in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 329, issue of April 27, 1932. The leading article is a study of the Wickersham report entitled “Lawlessness by Officers of the Law”. The next article occupies seven pages and is entitled: “On the Roman Catholic Front—Illegalities at Pittston and Swoyersville—Every God-fearing, law-abiding citizen of Pittston and Swoyersville will read this with profoundest concern.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The jury that sat on the Morgan case did not have the benefit of that clear statement of the facts (indeed, they do not have it yet), and that makes it all the more remarkable that they could have arrived so directly, so truly, so faithfully, at what must have been for them the solution of a difficult problem. But now let us show you how God arranged the whole affair.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Jury Helped from on High</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Well, the jury listened to conflicting evidence and conflicting pleas of lawyers for three days, and then, according to their own story, they vent into the jury room and the first thing they said was, in effect, “We are here in the presence of Almighty God and we must see that justice is rendered in this case.” Another report said, “Every man and woman on that jury loves God and wants to do His will.” Another said: “No doubt Morgan and his friends are this moment on their knees before God asking that justice may be done; we must decide this thing truly, justly, in the fear of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rest is only imagination, for we were not there, and, in the few moments of interview accorded, only a few impressions could he gathered. But we can imagine the jury taking their seats and saying, “Now let us read this paper and see just what it says.” And they had but to read the first line and they knew what it was all about. This is what they read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">American Rights and Liberties at Swoyersville On May 10, 1931, the Roman Catholic priest of Swoyersville, Pa., caused the arrest of Nicholas Bele-kon, Mike Wargo, John Wargo and Mike Hubal, charged with selling books without a license. After being in jail four hours, they were brought before a magistrate, where complaints were made and warrants issued. The original complainants were the Catholic priest, a police officer and three other witnesses, but the charges were drawn only in the name of the officer and two of the witnesses. Judas and Caiaphas disappeared from the scene before Jesus was formally arraigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They read that page, and turned it over, and then they found just what the Lord wanted them to have, for there right before them was Judge Rutherford’s letter to Judge Valentine, occupying six full pages of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font8">which contained the very help that they needed and that up to that moment had been denied them. There they saw for themselves that the lie oft-repeated in the courtroom and in the papers that the Watch Tower people are communists has not a vestige of truth in it, and they were able to see clearly just what we are doing and trying to do, and why we are so desperately in earnest about it. In other words, Judge Rutherford w<sup>r</sup>as right there in that jury room, counseling those good men and women in a crucial hour of their lives.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Jury Passed the Crucial Test</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The jury passed the crucial test. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> was on trial; the Watch Tower was on trial; Judge Rutherford was on trial; Jehovah God heard their prayer. They stayed in that jury room eleven hours, fighting it out. They had to find the truth in that one issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> or not at all; and they found it. What a rebuke to the insincere, many of whom do not know to this day that the Lord’s organization is all one, all knit together, all aiming at the same thing, and all under the one directing Head!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you know what happened to that jury while they were there in that jury room? Let us try to tell you just what Judge Rutherford has shown us in the Scriptures. Right then and there, we believe, they took their stand for ever on the Lord’s side; right then and there they came to those that were in prison and did something substantial for their comfort. The verdict was not large ($250), and was not expected to be, but it was a just verdict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These men and women took their stand for Jehovah God, and for the people of Jehovah God, in the face of district attorneys, assistant district attorneys, mayors, magistrates, police chiefs, city commissioners, the clergy, and the newspapers (all of them) in the cities where they live, and they did it because they feared God and because they love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now do you know what the Lord’s verdict is for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">them,</span><span class="font8"> for these Jonadabs; here it is, and nothing could be plainer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And if you were to talk with these sweet-spirited, honest-hearted, lovable Jonadabs that composed that jury, you would find it all true, that they cannot yet see what we see so clearly, that they have really and truly passed from death unto life and if they maintain their present condition of heart they will, without a question of doubt, be among the millions now living </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">will </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">never die.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Oct. 25, 1933. Mr. A. R. Goux</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peoples Pulpit Association Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear AIk. Goux:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your letter to Mr. C. F. Stout, relative to a news item which appeared in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Courier-News,</span><span class="font7"> has been referred to me, inasmuch as the matter of news comes under my supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would you be good enough to tell me whether Charles Parkhurst is a member of your organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norman Nairn, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Managing Editor</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PEOPLES PULPIT ASSOCIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">124 Columbia Heights - Brooklyn - New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">October 29, 1933 Norman Nairn</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Managing Editor, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News </span><span class="font7">Plainfield, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks for your letter of October 25, acknowledging on behalf of your employer, C. F. Stout, my letter to him of October 24. For your convenient consideration, this reply is prepared in seven parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">first</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You ask, “Would you be good enough to tell me whether Charles Parkhurst is a member of your organization ? ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That name (“Charles Parkhurst”) was given to you, as I suppose, by some one of the Plainfield police department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the same name mentioned by a Plainfield police officer who on Sunday October 22, about noon, talked with some of Jehovah’s witnesses, in Plainfield. That officer, in a Ford sedan car, drove alongside of a car in which were riding (on Rushmore Avenue) several of Jehovah’s witnesses who had just completed their assigned duties in one section of Plainfield and were then moving to another part of the city to finish their day’s work of proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of the true God, JEHOVAH, by delivering to the people at their homes that message as set forth in a printed booklet (“Escape to the Kingdom”) and also a printed announcement (like attached sample, headed “radio ASSEMBLY”) inviting the people to hear a talk by Judge Rutherford on “The Value of Knowledge and Understanding”, to be broadcast that evening over a special network including stations WPG, WODA, WHOM and WBBR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That police officer asked whether “Charles Parkhurst” of “East Orange” was in the car. On being told that he was not, and that the occupants of the car had no information to give about “Charles Parkhurst”, the officer very nervously concluded the interview by saying that the chief of police desired to have a talk with Parkhurst if he would come to the station; that if Parkhurst did come, he (the officer) would take him to the chief’s residence, and that if he did not come, the chief would send Parkhurst a letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To enable you to verify the foregoing, the police chief, Charles Flynn, can, of course, furnish the name of the officer who was sent to deliver the message about “Charles Parkhurst”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following facts are given for the consideration of those who read this letter, and also as further answer to your inquiry. All can be verified by consulting the Plainfield police chief, Flynn, and other members of the Plainfield city “government” w<sup>r</sup>ho have personal knowledge thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Charles Parkhurst” about whom you inquire evidently is Harry L. Parkhurst, of Verona, New Jersey, one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To Harry L. Parkhurst, at his request (made by him on his own responsibility), a certain document was given in the municipal building at Plainfield on Saturday October 21, 1933, immediately after he had personally interviewed the police chief, Flynn, in the presence of a clerk whom the chief had called into the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following is an exact copy of the original of that document. [Bracketed words are explanatory additions by me.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(SIGNED) CHAS. A. FLYNN,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chief of Police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parkhurst’s purpose in calling upon the police chief October 21 was, as I am informed, to give Flynn an opportunity to prove the genuineness of what he (Flynn) had been represented by your paper as having ‘declared’ last September when the Union county judge, E. A. McGrath, summarily reversed a judgment of the Plainfield police recorder, De Meza, which judgment the city attorney, Will Newcom, hypocritically tried to have sustained by the county judge against seventeen of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those seventeen men and women (including one woman more than seventy years of age) had been illegally arrested in Plainfield Saturday July 29,1933, thrown into jail there, and held for more than twenty-four hours without a hearing, because they had been “caught” by some of “Plainfield’s finest” going from house to house in Plainfield giving the people printed notices of a mass meeting to be held the next day in the Plainfield Strand Theater, to hear Judge Rutherford tell “Why Religious Intolerance is Practiced Now in This Country”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those seventeen persons, as well as scores of others of Jehovah’s witnesses, were virtually compelled to go from house to house in Plainfield on July 29 to provide the people of the city with due notice of the Strand Theater mass meeting BECAUSE of the unwarranted refusal of your employer to authorize the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> advertising department to accept payment, at your full card rate, for inserting a six-column advertisement which had been offered to your paper through a recognized advertising agency of New York city. The attached proof of that advertisement (as set and published on July 29 by the Elizabeth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal)</span><span class="font7"> is exactly like the copy offered to Plainfield </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> for publication as paid advertising matter. It contains only the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">MASS MEETING of the people of Central New Jersey</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AT THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">STBAND THEATER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAINFIELD, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunday, July 30, 1933 3 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL HEAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JUDGE RUTHERFORD </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in person </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TELL WHY RELIGIOUS </span><span class="font6">INTOLERANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IS PRACTICED NOW IN THIS COUNTRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All law-abiding, order-loving persons of New Jersey are vitally concerned in this matter and this notice of meeting is given that all who so desire may hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ADMISSION FREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOURTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now to return to Parkhurst. A few who read this may be inclined to express the thought that he was or is affiliated with the somewhat ancient Holy Roman Catholic order called the Society of Jesus, full-fledged members of which are commonly known as Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perish the thought!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parkhurst is only one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, when convenient for you, Nairn, to do so, you might remind the police chief, Flynn, that Parkhurst has not as yet received the letter which Flynn’s messenger said on October 22 the chief would send.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIFTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For convenient consideration of others who have read about Flynn’s ‘declaration’ mentioned in Part Third, paragraph one, of this letter (as well as for you), the following is quoted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> for September 16, 1933, page 4:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL CONTINUE ARRESTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Police Chief Charles A. Flynn’s reaction to yesterday’s decision was to declare that arrests of persons who distribute circulars in this city without permits will be continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will observe (by reference to Part Second of this letter) that the so-called “official canvassing permit” issued October 21, 1933, by Flynn to Harry Parkhurst is specifically limited to weekdays “between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore it clearly appears that the lawful work done in Plainfield on Sunday October 22 by H. L. Parkhurst, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses (in exactly the same manner as similar work was done that day in Plainfield by more than a hundred other persons, also acting as Jehovah’s witnesses), was done and performed entirely apart from and without any reference whatsoever to the so-called “permit” FALSELY mentioned in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> “story” (October 23) as having been ‘obtained from the police chief, Flynn, in compliance with police regulations’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To you, sir, as to your employer, I say, if those of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> organization responsible for publishing that falsehood knew before it was put in type that it was a falsehood, then you are doubly reprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIXTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why continue to follow the lead of misguided “public servants” of Plainfield who admittedly execute the orders of the clergy and then, by means of lies, cowardly try to whitewash hypocritical and cruelly malicious attempts to misrepresent and persecute humble men and women who, as witnesses of the true God, JEHOVAH, are willing to go from house to house in your community unselfishly to do good to the many residents who voluntarily acknowledge that they are delighted to be visited by Jehovah’s witnesses at any time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As publishers of “The Paper That Is Read In The Home”, those of your organization concerned in this certainly owe to every member of every home that received a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> for October 23 an apology, at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you care to be fair, publish this letter and mine </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to C. F. </span><span class="font7">Stout of October 24, as both of these are written, and then the responsibility will rest where </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font7">belongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SEVENTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Or, if your employer and you prefer, you may have the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-News</span><span class="font7"> advertising department bill me, at the paper’s regular display rate, for one full page of space, in which you are hereby authorized to print in full, on or before November 2, 1933, these two letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you choose to do this, kindly send me advance proof of the advertisement.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>An Important Announcement to Radio Station Owners</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By the Watch Tower Radio Department</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">udge Rutherford's Plainfield speech on “Religious Intolerance” is now available in electrical transcription. Every order-loving man and woman in America is entitled to hear and consider the truthful and timely information set forth in that speech. Owners of radio stations are being given the first opportunity to broadcast it in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No station owner is desired or expected by The Watch Tower to do anything at any time which, in his sober judgment, will jeopardize or really harm him or his business associates. It may be expected, of course, that a few will be offended when this speech is widely broadcast. On the other’ hand, it is confidently anticipated that every honest person, even though temporarily offended, will happily acknowledge the truth when he learns and considers all the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For these reasons a copy of the complete text of the Plainfield speech, exactly as recorded for broadcasting, is being furnished at once for information of the station’s responsible officer, that he may decide intelligently whether he desires to have a share in broadcasting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SIXTY-MINUTE </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">period required</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Local Watch Tower representatives are prepared to conclude at once a lawful agreement with stations that are willing to broadcast this program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To each station that chooses to present the entire one-hour program (consisting of the speech, with opening and concluding announcements), 33J rpm disks will be furnished without cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font8">convenience of listeners, there is included in the program an announcement that similar lectures by means of electrical transcription will be advertised from time to time in each community and all are invited to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">INTOLERANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Why Religious Intolerance Is Practiced Now in This Country” is the subject chosen by Judge Rutherford for his speech delivered a few weeks ago at Plainfield, New Jersey. There, in the Strand theater and in two near-by auditoriums connected by public-address systems, a visible audience of two thousand persons listened. Other thousands heard at the same time, as the speech was broadcast over a network of powerful stations in the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the theater a strange and remarkable spectacle was witnessed by those present. Before the speaker's arrival, groups of police officers in uniform and plain-clothes men, scores of them in all, poured into the Strand and took up positions at every entrance and exit and on the stage. Openly displaying automatic revolvers, ammunition supplies, riot guns and sawed-off shotguns, those gunmen (under control of the Roman Catholic police chief of Plainfield) remained at their assigned positions in the theater throughout the entire period of the peaceful assembly. Their presence as officers was neither requested nor required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The speech of Judge Rutherford was given by him in the Strand theater and simultaneously broadcast, exactly as prepared for the occasion and as it is now recorded for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“effect of holy year”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this connection The Watch Tower takes pleasure in announcing that recently the Federal Radio Commission by letter officially requested owners of many broadcasting stations to report whether both or either of two speeches by Judge Rutherford entitled ‘‘Way of Escape” and “Holy Year” were broadcast by the station June 18 and June 25, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to lawful agreement between the stations and Watch Tower representatives, these two vitally important speeches (in electrical transcription) were satisfactorily broadcast by hundreds of stations. For this service the stations were duly paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many, including members of the commission, noted with interest that the response from the radio audience was tremendous, commenting on and commending these programs. Among those approving are many who state that they are Catholics and are delighted to have the matter Scripturally stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A VAIN ATTEMPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some station managers, on receiving that inquiry of the radio commission regarding the two speeches, recalled the nation-wide attempt made openly and covertly last summer by the Roman Catholic hierarchy through its press, clergy, knightly orders and affiliated societies (with cooperation of sympathizing Hebrew and Protestant groups) to “drive Rutherford from the air”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At this date, broadcasting of the Truth, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">set forth in the Word of the true God, JEHOVAH, continues. Each week more than three hundred stations present in the public interest one or more of the recorded speeches of Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“back to the church”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What “the church” failed to accomplish last summer to “silence Rutherford” by the combined activity of its own and allied organizations, its agents inside and outside of the federal government have since sought to attain by cunning use of the political office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just now, throughout the country, leaders of Hebrew, Catholic and Protestant associations are uniting in starting a national movement to get the people “back to the church”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Not All the Clergy Are Alike</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">E PUBLISH the following communication to the Sunbury (Pa.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Item,</span><span class="font8"> and a brief reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dalmatia, Pa., Oct. 2, 1933. Editor, The Sunbury Item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIVE, AND LET LIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether you live in city, country town, or farmhouse far distant from the traveled road, you will probably hear a gentle knock on your door. You open, and there you see standing a man or woman, cultured in expression of face, neat, smiling in spite of all obstacles, carrying some kind of handbag. Your attention is at once caught by the stranger’s words of introduction, somewhat on this wise, “1 am from the Watch Tower, and bring you a message of good news, etc. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now one of two things happen: either you at once discourage the evangelist, or you encourage him. The average individual unconsciously permits the glorious introduction to continue. Gently but surely the caller leads up to his business, that of selling you a set of Judge Rutherford’s books. If not a set, then surely three or four, at least one. The book is attractive in its various bright colors, and the price per book is about thirty cents. Either you buy, or you firmly decline. If you decline, a book, a pamphlet, or more pamphlets are pressed upon you free. This is evangelization with teeth in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these books you will read much that is good, but some that is bad. For example, the judge has written that the star which guided the wise men to the Christ-Child was placed there by Satan. Strange that the Scriptures should glorify the works of Satan, and that a work of Satan should lead men to the cradle of God's Son. As you read these startling statements do you wonder whether the judge has done justice to Holy Writ, whether he is a graduate of a recognized seminary, whether consecrated men who have studied scripture for years agree with him, whether institutions of learning have sought to honor him by public recognition, whether he is helping or hindering men’s spiritual life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judge condemns all clergy as servants of Satan. Is this not a strong and unjustified charge? Would God permit ministers to continue preaching year after year, misleading His people, if they were servants of Satan? Granted that some clergy are bad, it does not follow that all are bad. Because some politicians are crooked, we cannot say that all politicians are crooked. Because some hypocrites are found in the church, it is cruelly unjust to denounce all as being hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The judge condemns churches as “organized Christianity’’, the creation and servant of Satan. Here he reflects seriously upon himself and his followers. The judge and his followers consider themselves Christians, in fact, they think that they alone are worthy of the name. They have a very complete organization, with a leader, a publishing house, districts, contacting tho public by radio, lectures in theaters, travels by the judge here and abroad, and by their house-to-house agents, who are at once peddlers and missionaries. They have an organization that reaches the remotest home. The Watch Tower people live in a glass house, and must not throw stones against “organized Christianity’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I seek no quarrel with Judge Rutherford and his followers. This land is free for religious thinking and preaching, a land of toleration. Let the judge gi\e others the rights that lie claims for himself am] his. Let him preach, not accuse blindly. Let him cease to trouble the church of God. Let him live, and let live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Walter E. Wagner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It occasionally happens that an honest man gets into the Roman Catholic priesthood or into the Protestant ministry, but these exceptions do not justify the continuance of a business that is in effect that of a jailer whose duty it is to see that his prisoners are kept weak and sick and unable to escape. Such honest men are priests or ministers merely by accident. The bulk of the men in this business are jailers because they wish to be such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once in a great while one of the clergy realizes the predicament he is in, and is in distress not only for the poor people but for himself. We recently heard of a pastor in a country church in Columbia county, Pennsylvania, who openly acknowledges to the people that he is teaching them from Judge Rutherford's books, because they are the truth, and he is advising the members of the church to get the books and study them, and they are doing so. In Armageddon the great Jehovah God is going to take care of the eternal interests of that man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently one of Jehovah's witnesses placed a full set of Judge Rutherford’s books with a colored pastor of a church in Scranton. He had read </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font8"> loves it, and promised to teach the people of his church what is contained in that book and in the other books of the set. He manifests a lovely and lovable spirit and is manifestly a child of God. Judge Rutherford is not writing in condemnation or reproof of men like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is writing what the Lord bids him write, expounding the prophecies that show the general faithlessness of the clergy<sup>7</sup> and the church members of our day. The Scriptures tell him to ‘Cry aloud, and spare not; show my people their transgressions’. He is doing that, and does not dare do otherwise. His business is to hew to the line and let the chips fly where they may. Sectarianism is all wrong; it must go down; it will go down; it is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font8"> on the way down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The incident about the “wise men” or magi being guided to Bethlehem by the mysterious lights in the sky comports perfectly with what is known of the activities of the demons; and as it is positively known that Satan was always seeking means to kill Jesus, as was manifested over and over again, Judge Rutherford’s explanation is the only rational one ever presented. The magi (magicians, spirit mediums) were not necessarily evil-minded men; they were merely deluded men, tools of the adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Wagner makes the same inquiry regarding Judge Rutherford that some made respecting Jesus, and because the whole story is apropos we quote it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he dcceiveth the people. Howbeit no man spake openly of him, for fear of the Jews. Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. He that speak-eth of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seek-eth his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you kcepeth the law. Why go ye about to kill me? The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?— John 7:12-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All now admit that Jesus was right and His critics wrong; He told them plainly how they could test His claims; if they had done it they might have had life. Jehovah God never compels anybody to give heed to the warnings He sends, nor to the Scriptures which would mean their salvation. He respects the free moral agency of every human creature, and holds each responsible for obedience to the light he has received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Wagner and others may accept and read and believe Judge Rutherford’s books and act on them, if they choose. It is up to them. But the books are true, and the men and women that are braving every condition to take them to the people are true, also; collectively Jehovah’s witnesses in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Willing to Take a Try at Honest Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">YOUNG man of 32, resigning from the pastorate of the Congregational church at Sandwich, England, gave as his reasons for resigning: “I would rather earn my bread with pick and shovel. The position of a minister is no longer consistent with the dignity of man. All over the country ministers are restless and unhappy, and not a few of them are bordering on nervous prostration on account of the strife and general unpleasantness in the churches.” Looks as though the big revival were really under way in England.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Latin America—The Question Mark of the 20th Century</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Five Parts—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 4 </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bolivia—the Cloudland Republic</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font8">OLIVIA, also called the Mountain Republic, lies at an elevation of 12,470 feet above sea level, and in the winter season, June, July, August and September, can furnish inconveniences second to none on earth. In a climate as cold as the United States in November or December, the people live in houses with rooms thirty feet long and sixteen feet high with no arrangements whatever for warming them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The size of Bolivia, 506,467 square miles, is almost that of Peru. The population is 2,974,900, of which 1,586,650 are Indians, 426,200 are whites, and 962,000 of mixed races. It is really an Indian republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two miles above sea level is Lake Titicaca, the size of Lake Erie, the highest navigable body of water on the globe. About its shores the Indians live much as they did four hundred years ago, before the coming of the Spaniards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ponchos of the men are of every color under the sun, but the dirt of years tones them all down until they blend beautifully. The Bolivian men never bathe; they are afraid of pneumonia. Wherever the Indian women go they carry on their weaving or knitting. A woman will wear eight or nine skirts at once, making her look like a perambulating umbrella.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The silver mines at Potosi, now worked out, probably produced more silver than ever came from any other one mining district. The mines were discovered by an Indian clambering up a steep mountain side after a straying llama. Thousands of men were worked to death in these mines. Bolivia is the second tin-producing country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though Sucre is the capital of Bolivia, La Paz is the chief city and the seat of government. It is one of the show cities of the world. It is substantially built on 40 hills, spanned by 20 bridges, with clean, well paved streets. As the traveler gets his first view of it lying in a valley one thousand feet deep, with vertical walls ten miles long and three wide, surrounded by snowcapped mountains, the scene is unforgettable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Looking for Trouble</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bolivia at the moment is fighting with Paraguay for possession of a vast swamp, the Gran Chaco, which neither of them needs or wants. They both have more immensely rich and valuable lands than they can develop, but the munition makers of Britain and America have arms to sell, and are willing to loan money to help, and so the fratricidal war goes merrily on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At present Bolivia gets to the outside world by rail lines through Peru, Chile, Argentina or Brazil. She seeks a port on the Paraguay river where she would be measurably independent of all these. And there is said to be oil in the Gran Chaco. Probably she wants the port and the oil. Paraguay wants the port and the oil, and wants to handle the trade of Bolivia besides, in any way she sees fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the flood season the Paraguay goes over its banks and inundates the Gran Chaco back for a distance of fifty miles into Bolivia. The undeveloped capacity of the Mountain Republic for grain, vegetables, hay, fruit, sugar, rice, coffee, beef and dairy products, wool and mutton is said to be incredible. Agriculture is carried on now in only the most primitive way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A missionary who spent eighteen years among the Indians of the Gran Chaco says that Europeans have the greatest difficulty in becoming accustomed to their dialects. He said that when they talk “they hiss with their tongues, snore with their nostrils, grind with their teeth and gurgle with their throats, so that you seem to hear the quacking of ducks in a pond rather than the voices of men talking<sup>-</sup>’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Fighting Paraguayans</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paraguay, not counting its claim upon the Gran Chaco, is of about the size and general location in the continent of South America as are Illinois and Indiana in the Northern continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Guaranis of Paraguay proved to be the most difficult antagonists the Spaniards met in the new world. In the year 1600 the Spanish general Hernandarias de Saavedra undertook to exterminate the Charruas, akin to the Guaranis tribes, and his army was itself exterminated. With that, Hernandarias petitioned Philip II, king of Spain, that it was impossible to subdue the Charruas by force of arms and that missionaries must be resorted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This was a dirty trick on the part of Hernandarias, but it worked. The job was turned over to the Jesuits, who were promised that they might have the Indians, body and soul, with all their possessions, if they would but conquer them. Each villa or tribe was turned over to two Jesuits, who speedily organized them into a most remarkable body of obedient and industrious servants. Everything that the Indians did was for the benefit of the order of the Jesuits, which fed them, clothed them and provided them with all their simple necessities. The magnificent churches which were built consumed a large part of the income, as is the Catholic practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To prevent others from interfering with their work of complete subjugation, the Jesuits turned each villa or tribe into a huge stockade. No one was permitted to enter or to leave without a written order. Only such Indians might ride horseback as looked after livestock. Admittance was refused, not only to other Indians, but to other priests, and even to the Spanish authorities. The intent was to do the job right, while they were at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a century and a half the Spanish government concluded that the job of subjugating the Indians had been overdone, and on February 27, 17G7, Carlos III issued a mandate that the Jesuits themselves must leave the country. They complied in one year, but in that year they had so successfully finished their work of subjugation and enslavement of mind that, when they left, the Indians, by a treacherous prearrangement, also left, scattered to the four winds and let themselves and the country revert back to barbarism.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Subjugation by Adulteration</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">In the sections of Paraguay not under the thumb of the Jesuits, other means of subjugating the Guaranis were adopted. The Spanish general Ayolas stipulated in a treaty wuth the tribe that seven women should be provided for himself and two for each of his soldiers. If you want to know why there are more Mestizos in South America than there are Indians, and why there are many more Mestizos than there are Spaniards, now you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the year 1865 the Paraguayan president Francisco Lopez, brilliant and insanely courageous militarist and dictator, made deliberate preparations for a war of conquest. When the time was ripe for action, though he was already at war with Brazil, he issued, through Congress, a declaration of war against Argentina, March 18,1865. He reminds one of Kaiser Wilhelm II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay formed an alliance to oppose him. Lopez drafted every man between 12 and 70 into the army, and many of the women, and fought until 1,200,000 inhabitants had been slain, including himself. All the men of the country were destroyed except 28,746; they left behind them 202,333 women and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Bolivia knows when she is well off she will let these descendants of the indomitable Guaranis have the Gran Chaco or anything else rather than try to whip them. The last we heard, the women and school children in Paraguay were enlisting for the Gran Chaco fight, and the complete defeat of the Bolivian army is a foregone conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A pathetic feature of the situation for the Bolivians is that their troops cannot stand the love altitude, and as soon as they enter the Gran Chaco die like flies from galloping consumption, contracted in the steaming tropical forest. L<sup>T</sup>p to May 10, it is estimated, 50,000 Paraguayans alone had been slain, wounded or imprisoned in the Gran Chaco fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ridiculousness of the League of Nations is shown in that, while both Bolivia and Paraguay are members, Paraguay formally declared a state of war on May 10. This is the first official declaration of a state of war between League members, though Japan cheerfully butchered tens of thousands of Chinese in her professedly peaceful operations in China, while both were members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a grand people the Paraguayans will be when they get into the kingdom of God. One feels like taking them the truth now. They are admitted to be one of the most progressive and intelligent peoples of the Western Hemisphere. The climate is excellent. Immigration is encouraged. Let’s go! But, when you get there, don’t try to start a fight. If you do you will get something worse than is meted out by the priest-ridden police and magistrates of benighted New Jersey.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Chile, the California of South America</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Both are in the extreme southwest of the Americas, very long and quite narrow, partly desert and partly paradise, rich in minerals and fruits, and each has a progressive citizenry and many Japanese. Chile has every climate known to man, and almost every kind of enterprise. It is as long as from Maine to California, but at its widest place only 248 miles, and from that down to 70. Nevertheless, the total area is of the size of all that portion of the United States north of the Potomac and Ohio rivers and east of the Mississippi river, excepting only Maryland, Michigan and Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The curse of Chile is that the whole country has been pretty well owned by about 100 Roman Catholic families from the Basque provinces of the Spanish Pyrenees. Wherever the dead hand of that system rests it rests to bless the rich and curse the poor. All the best parts of the rich interior valley which runs the length of the country are in the hands of these 100 favored families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although the law provides that land shall be divided up into equal shares among all children, the law is evaded, and although a mansion or hacienda may shelter a group of families, the estates themselves are not split up. Consequently, antiquated agricultural methods persist. Life on the haciendas is a paradise for the favorites of the church; but now see what happens to the actual producer of food:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A landed proprietor allows any farm laborer to take up as much land as he can till with the assistance of his family. He pays no rent, and the produce of the land is his own; but he has to sell his services to the landlord, whenever need for them arises (which is always at just the time when he needs them himself) at less than one-half of the local prevailing rate. Thus the great landlords retain control of their vast estates and get their labor for next to nothing; a crafty, cruel, vicious system, by which the nabobs continue to ride on the backs of the workers.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>A Flaw in the Government</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">A flaw in the government is that senators must have a fixed income of $2,000 a year, and deputies of $500, and that all serve without salary. The effect of this is to keep the control of the country in the hands of those who have incomes, and thus we have an oligarchy instead of a republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nevertheless, the Chilean government has passed some very progressive measures. For example, a special room is provided in factories where mothers may keep their children under one year of age, and may spend one hour of the working day in caring for them without any loss of wage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Longitudinal Railway extends 2,862 miles through the beautiful Longitudinal Valley. There are three lines over the Andes: two into Bolivia and one into Argentina. Chile controls both sides of the Straits of Magellan, for their entire length, and at their city of Punta Arenas, at the southeastern mouth of the straits, they do an immense business in the provisioning and other equipment of 2,000 vessels a year. Punta Arenas, by the way, is the most southerly city on the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much of the money which has come into Chile has come from the nitrate of sodium obtained in the rainless district in the far north. When the first cargo was taken to Liverpool, about 1830, its value was not known, and as there were no purchasers, the contents were finally throwm overboard. In a single year since then nitrates of the value of $172,800,000 were shipped from the deposits, which cover 600 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chile has enormous coal and iron deposits and is the second copper-producing country of the world. She has everything needed to create a great empire of industry, and is such in fact. Her exportsfor the year 1929 were $278,439,680.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chile is calling for settlers. A generation ago agents at Tokyo offered forty acres of good land for every immigrant, twenty acres more for each son of 18 years and over, a yoke of oxen, a set of agricultural implements, and a sum of money equivalent to $15 a month for the first year of residence. There is a steamer line from Chile to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chileans Mostly Europeans</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A great majority of the Chilean population of 4,287,445 is of European origin. Santiago, capital and chief city, is situated about 2,000 feet above sea level; the population is 712,593. Next to Rio de Janeiro it is considered the most beautiful city in South America. The trolley conductors in Santiago are women with white aprons, who wear little sailor caps perched on their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Santiago has great contrasts of riches and poverty, which is the Roman Catholic ideal. The rich are very rich, the poor are very poor; many limousines, few Fords. There is no plumbing to speak of. The houses of the workingmen are mostly of one room. There is a surplus of rich churches and bronze and marble monuments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From 1907 to 1924 there were 12,694 earthquakes; an average of two daily. Homes are unheated, making it often necessary in winter to wear an overcoat in the house. There are numerous women of English and German type, due to the fact that European settlers married Chilean wives. The women are more progressive than in Peru. Snobbishness is prevalent. Chile is proud of her educational institutions.</span></p>

The very men that condemn these verses are the ones to whom they apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those that are out regularly in the service work from door to door, witnessing to the patent fact that God’s kingdom is the only possible hope of the world, find that their greatest enemies are the wicked and deceitful clergy; hence in quoting these verses we will quote the five verses that precede them and will say that •we endorse them 100 percent. The verses follow :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful, are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>Responsibility for World Tribulation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font8">IXCE A.D. 1914 great sorrow, suffering, perplexity, and distress have been upon earth's peoples. In those countries claiming to form “Christendom” the people have especially suffered. Who is responsible for this tribulation upon the world ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy of “Christendom” answer and inform their parishioners that it is the God of heaven that has brought this trouble upon them as an expression of His anger because the people have been negligent of their duties to the church organization of “Christendom”. Since the vindication of Jehovah's name is the issue of supreme importance now, it is certain that God's enemy Satan does everything within his power to defame that holy name and to turn the people away from Jehovah God. If, also, the Bible shows “Christendom” to be in fact part of Satan's organization, the true and correct answer to our question could not be expected to proceed from the clergy of “Christendom”. The clergy’s answer is indeed wrong, and serves Satan’s purpose to turn the people against Jehovah God. Many people hearing the false answer say: “If that is the kind of God we have I don’t care to serve him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Talk of tribulation now: wait till the battle of Armageddon! There is a wide distinction between the trouble that is today upon the world and the battle of Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Revelation 16:14) Jehovah has had no part in the trouble that is now upon the world. When He does take action in that connection, it will be so emphatic that there will be no reason to doubt that it proceeds from Him and that He is responsible. All will then know that Jehovah is God and that He is taking action and that Jehovah is supreme. For this reason He caused His prophet Ezekiel to repeat the statement time and again: “And they shall know that I am Jehovah.”—Ezekiel 6:10, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“God is love.” That means He is unselfish in all His acts. His law denounces wickedness and commands the doing of what is right. Those who love Jehovah keep His commandments. The transgression of Jehovah’s law is sin. Lucifer was the first transgressor. Jehovah did not appoint Satan the Devil to the high position of lord or “god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4); He did appoint Lucifer to the exalted position of overlord of the world. It was after this that iniquity was made manifest in Lucifer. (Ezekiel 28:13-15) He rebelled against Jehovah and disputed the supremacy of Jehovah’s authority, caused a host of angels to follow him in wickedness, and led man into sin and death. Such wrongful act has caused men to suffer the consequences naturally flowing from the transgression of God's law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the rebellion of Lucifer Jehovah gave Him the names Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil. Jehovah did not take away from him the rulership of the world, and for this there was a good reason. Satan boasted of ability to turn all mankind against Jehovah God. He arrogantly assumed to be equal to the Most High. (Isaiah 14:13,14) He challenged Jehovah to put men on earth who would firmly stand against the wily and wicked influence of Satan and who would maintain their integrity toward Jehovah. Thereby was raised the issue of supremacy. It pleased Jehovah God to prove to all creation that Satan is a liar, and that Jehovah is just, true and righteous and is supreme and besides Him there is no other, and that His word is always true and right.—Job 2:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was necessary to give Satan an opportunity to prove his boast and challenge in order that the issue might be clearly tried out and settled, and therefore Jehovah accepted the challenge and permitted Satan to do his worst. He appointed a period of time over which Satan was to be permitted to exercise his free hand without divine interference. The time must come when the question at issue must be settled, and, when it is settled, Satan's world (his organization) must end and Jehovah’s name must be vindicated and exalted in the mind of every creature that lives. Such vindication will prove Jehovah to be always right and that everything good, including life and the blessings attending thereupon, proceeds from Jehovah God and none can have life eternal except from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the suffering that has been upon the world is due to transgression, and particularly to the wickedness of Satan. The suffering of the people has resulted as a natural consequence of wrongdoing. Jehovah has no pleasure in the wicked. He is angry with the wicked at all times; but He awaits His own good time to act against the wicked, and when He does act it will be for the vindication of His own Word and name. (Psalms 5:4; 7:9-11; Zephaniah 3:8) The wicked plot against and oppress those who are diligent in their efforts to obey and serve Jeho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">vah. It is therefore wholly inconsistent to say that the sorrow and distress, suffering and oppression, that are now upon the human race, proceed from Jehovah in the exercise of His wrath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The one responsible for the sorrow and suffering and distress upon the world to the present time is Satan. In addition to causing the people in general to suffer, Satan has caused his agents to defame the name of Jehovah by having them tell the people that Jehovah is bringing this trouble upon mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The night of His last supper with His apostles Jesus told them that His Father Jehovah had covenanted with Him (Jesus) for the kingdom and that He was going away to receive the kingdom, and that He would return and receive His faithful followers unto himself. (Luke 22: 28-30; John 14:1-3) The exact day and hour of His return no man knew; no, not even the angels in heaven knew, nor the Lord Jesus himself. “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.” (Matthew 24:36) When Jesus reached heaven Jehovah said to Him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” Jehovah alone knew the time limit. Concerning this the apostle Paul wrote: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Hebrews 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The period of waiting ended in A.D. 1914. Jehovah then installed His King in office and sent Him forth to rule. (Psalm 2: 6-8; 110:1, 2) Had Satan at that time voluntarily vacated his place as the god or overlord of the world, and disbanded his organization and surrendered to Christ Jesus’ righteous reign, there would have been no trouble so far as the change of administration is concerned. For Satan to vacate thus, however, would have been an admission on his part that he had been wrong at all times. This he would not admit. Satan resisted the authority of Christ Jesus, and the result was that “there was war in heaven: Michael [heavenly title of Jesus] and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceive th the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”—Revelation 12: 7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just how long that war lasted is not revealed, but it is certain that it resulted in the ousting of Satan from heaven, and never again can he appear there as of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning the beginning of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ it is written: “Thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” (Revelation 11:17,18) Jehovah’s “wrath” here mentioned is against the wicked Satan, who refused to vacate and to give way to Christ and who is therefore ousted for ever from heaven. Jehovah did not make the nations angry and cause them to go to war and kill each other; and this is further proved by the fact that their killing of each other is a violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant concerning the shedding of blood. (Genesis 9:3-5) All the suffering and death resulting from the World War is properly chargeable to Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The World War was not an expression of Jehovah’s wrath against the nations and peoples of earth. The war in heaven between Christ Jesus and Satan was an expression of Jehovah’s wrath, and the casting of Satan out of heaven as the result of that expressed wrath was the occasion for great rejoicing of all the heavenly host; as it is written: “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.” (Revelation 12:10,12) Jehovah acts for the vindication of His name. War between the nations of earth could in no way whatsoever vindicate Jehovah’s name and hence is not due to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan knew that Jehovah had installed Christ Jesus as King and that the period of waiting was at an end and that now the great question at issue must be fully determined. Satan knew that he had failed to cause all men to curse Jehovah as he had boasted his ability to do. He knew that there were many people on earth who claimed to be followers of Christ and some who sincerely followed Him and maintained their integrity toward God. Now his purpose was to destroy the nations of the world, and particularly those called “Christendom”, rather than to see Jesus rule over them. For this reason Satan plunged the nations into the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">World</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">War, and </span><span class="font8">for four years the slaughtering of millions continued and other millions died from disease and pestilences attending the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan incited his commercial element on earth to bring on the war for selfish reasons, that they might accomplish some gain. He overreached the political element and caused them to declare the war; and he used his sanctimonious, hypocritical clergymen of “Christendom” to give a sanctity to the war. This explains why the clergymen of warring nations, all claiming to be Christian, advocated that their people should engage in the destruction of others who called themselves Christians. Every part of the World War was devilish in the extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In further proof that Satan is responsible for the tribulation upon the world beginning in 1914 and continuing since, it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Revelation 12:12) This proclamation followed Satan's being cast out of heaven. “The inhabiters of the earth” means the rulers, while “the sea” represents the masses of the people whom Satan had already alienated from God, and particularly includes those who hold on to the organization called “organized Christianity” and which is a part of Satan’s organization. Moved by envy and unrestrained wickedness Satan would destroy all of these rather than see them have a chance to know that Jehovah is God and to give their allegiance to Him. Hence it is Woe to them!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The World War of 1914 was the beginning of sorrows which Jesus prophesied would come at the end of the world. “All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24: 8) The sorrows beginning upon the world in 1914 have not proceeded from Jehovah through Christ Jesus, hut Satan has brought these sorrows upon mankind in his effort to drive them away from Jehovah and to accomplish the destruction of all those whom he cannot alienate from Jehovah. The year 1914 marked the beginning of sorrows, but not the end of them, by any means. Other sorrows quickly followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suddenly the World War ended, in 1918, but neither Satan nor any of his worldly organization had anything to do with causing it to cease. The wholesale slaughter of human creatures stopped with the end of the World War, but the sorrows upon the world that had begun in 1914 continued. Since then the Devil, by and through his organization, has continued to harass the people in his endeavor to turn them against Jehovah. Jehovah God exercised His power and authority to stop the World War. The prophecy by Jesus, in Matthew 24, showed that Satan would plunge the nations into the war, and also shows that Jehovah would stop the war; and He did bring it to a sudden end in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why should Jehovah stop the World War? The answer is found in these words of Jesus’ prophecy, to wit: “And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” (Matthew 24:22, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> A thing can be shortened by cutting a part out of the middle as well as by cropping off one or the other of its ends. Satan would never have stopped the World War, because his purpose was to destroy the human race. But that destruction would have brought no honor to Jehovah nor a vindication of His name. A work having to do with the vindication of Jehovah’s name must be done before the end of the great tribulation which would result in the complete destruction of Satan’s organization. Therefore, said Jesus: “For the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” It at once appears that Jehovah purposed to do something with the elect before the end of tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The elect company is made up of Christ Jesus and the members of “the body of Christ”, all of whom maintain their integrity toward Jehovah, and all of whom Satan has sought to destroy. The fact that men have been taken out of the world and made a part of the elect and have maintained their integrity toward Jehovah disproves Satan's contention and is to that extent a vindication of God’s name. The purpose of selecting this company of the elect is that the name of Jehovah may be made known before the final battle. In Acts 15:14 it is stated that in due course Jehovah proceeded to take out from the nations a “people for his name”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “shortened” days of tribulation must occur while some of the elect are yet on the earth, for the reason that the witness work which they must do by the Lord’s grace must be done on earth before the final end of Satan’s organization. Therefore, in answering His disciples’ questions Jesus also said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.’'’ (Matthew 24:14) The gospel or good news to all lovers of righteousness is that Satan’s rule has come to an end; that the kingdom of Jehovah, which will completely vindicate His name, is here; that Christ has been placed upon the throne as the great Ruler, and that all must know that Jehovah alone is the Almighty God over the whole earth. —Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that during the World War the witness work by the elect made no progress. Furthermore, not even the faithful followers of Christ Jesus then knew the real and essential purpose of God’s kingdom. They did not even know the meaning of the name Jehovah, and they did not understand that the greatest thing is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. It was in the year 1918 (A.D.) that Christ Jesus fulfilled Malachi’s prophecy (3:1) concerning His coming to Jehovah’s temple. It was after that time that Jesus judged those who were in the covenant with Jehovah. Hence the disturbed spiritual condition amongst those professing to be God's people. The approved ones Jesus promptly brought into the temple condition, and these were anointed by Jehovah with His spirit. To them now the words of 2 Corinthians 6:16 had application: ‘Te are the temple of the living God.” Then followed the enlightenment that enabled these faithful and anointed ones to see that the real purpose of God’s kingdom is the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why Jehovah had permitted wickedness in the earth was never understood by men on earth until after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. From then on the great issue or question for determination was made known to the temple class, and they understood that Jehovah’s name means or has reference to His purposes toward His creatures. His purpose is to prove that He can put creatures on earth that will maintain their integrity toward Him and that He is the Supreme One from whom all blessings flow. Jehovah anointed the temple class and gave to them a new name, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” and made them His witnesses in the earth.—Isaiah 62:1, 2; 65:15; Revelation 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah these witnesses, otherwise called “the remnant” (Revelation 12:17), must now go forth and bear testimony to the rulers of the earth and to the people that Jehovah is God, and that His kingdom is at hand, and that the Kingdom is the remedy for suffering humankind. This is therefore the most important message that was ever delivered on earth, because its declaration relates to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah shortened the great tribulation beginning in A.D. 1914 and did so for the elect's sake; and the clear inference is that when the elect have finished the work assigned to them by Jehovah there will be much tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great battle of the day of God Almighty has not yet begun, but it is near at hand, as all the evidence shows. To charge Jehovah with responsibility for the ills that now afflict the world is a gross defamation of His holy name. Jehovah is right and righteous at all times, and all His works are done in righteousness. The great battle of the day of God Almighty will be the worst tribulation that will ever have afflicted the world and it will be the result of the execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment. A brief description by His prophet Jeremiah (chapter 25) discloses that there will not be many persons left alive on the earth. That the great battle is yet future is clearly shown, both by the Scriptures and by the facts. While the Scriptures disclose that the battle of the great day of God Almighty will affect the entire earth, they also show that the greatest slaughter will be in the land known as “Christendom”. Satan has wickedly named a part of his organization as “Christian”, and for the hypocrisy practiced by all involved therein adequate recompense will be paid by the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan’s organization has not only oppressed the poor people of earth, but made murderous assaults upon Jehovah’s witnesses in an attempt to destroy them. Every one of the anointed would have been destroyed ere now except for the protection furnished by Jehovah. Particularly the clergy and the ‘principal ones of their flocks’ (Jeremiah 25:34-36) have mocked and continue to mock at Jehovah and to maltreat His witnesses. Jehovah by His prophet (Isaiah 28: 21, 22) says: “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim [2 Samuel 5:17-21], he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon [Joshua 10: 6-14], that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. Now, therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle Paul, referring to and quoting from the above prophecy, wrote: “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.” (Romans 9:28) Satan began the tribulation in 1914, and Jehovah stopped the wholesale slaughter in 1918 and thus shortened the days of tribulation for His own purposes. The tribulation was begun by Satan and carried on in unrighteousness; but soon Jehovah will take an active part therein, by the hand of Christ Jesus, and will “cut it short in righteousness”. That part begun by Jehovah will be the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which is sometimes called “the battle of Armageddon” because Revelation 16:13-16 describes the battle as taking place at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That will be the worst tribulation that will ever- have afflicted the world, and it will be the last, for the reason that the Wicked One and his organization will be done for and shall arise no more for ever.—Nahum 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every creature now hearing Jehovah’s truth must take his stand either on the side of Satan or on the side of Jehovah. Therefore the people of good will should now be encouraged to tell their neighbors about God's kingdom. The issue of supremacy long ago raised by the rebellious and wicked one must shortly be settled. Jehovah’s King Christ Jesus will destroy Satan’s organization, and that glorious kingdom will be for ever a vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>The Gardens of the Blind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">(From the London .Vews </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">R</span><span class="font8">ECENTLY the National Institute for the Blind in London issued a little booklet which tells how blind men and women love their gardens as passionately as the poet who sang:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A garden is a lovesome spot</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God wot......”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blind authors of the various sections have a wonderful knowledge of their subject; for they have powers of observation far greater than those of the horticulturist who sees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a dispute arose concerning the “identification of a species of flower, a botanist who had his sight named it incorrectly. The problem was settled by a blind man, who detected the slight difference by thrusting his tongue into the corolla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sound plays an important part in the blind man’s garden. In watering, for example, the position of a tree can be located by first directing the nozzle of the hose upon the leaves and listening for the patter of the spray. When a lateral movement plays the jet against the stem, a spitting sound is produced and the hose can then be lowered to the foot of the tree and left to do its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His sense of touch is a great help to the blind gardener. He can feel the weeds. The poppy is identified by its pendulous buds, and the plantain by the harsh texture of its leaves in the form of rosettes pressed close to the ground. Dandelions, buttercups, daisies, groundsel, chickweed and docks are not so readily recognizable, but each has characteristics known to the blind gardener. Thistles can be relied on to introduce themselves, and the same may be said of stinging nettles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is indeed good to realize that the blind can so wonderfully enter into the joys of gardening and that the loss of sight is to some extent compensated for by the quickening of the senses of touch and hearing. It will be still more wonderful, however, when there are no more blind eyes nor deaf ears, but when all, with full hearts, may look from Nature up to Nature’s God and gladly enter into the heritage prepared for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation for Fasting </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster {California')</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE seven steps that are given for breaking a fast should be preceded by a careful program of building the body up to a point where the system of the patient can stand the reactions of the eliminative procedure of fasting. In order to do this the patient must gradually change his habits from eating heavily to eating very moderately, so that the system will not go through too great a reaction and will be able to build even as it cleanses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A good way to start this program is to reverse the steps given in the article “Breaking a Fast’’ (the steps that follow). Use Step 7 first, which means eating three balanced meals a day: a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">fruit</span><span class="font8"> meal, a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">starch</span><span class="font8"> meal, and a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">protein </span><span class="font8">meal. One may follow this step for as long as one desires; but a week usually suffices to get the system prepared for the next step, which in this article is Step 6. Step 6 consists of the elimination of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">starches</span><span class="font8"> for the luncheon period, using instead raw vegetable salads and possible addition of protein, unless protein is used for the evening meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Step 5 is the elimination of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">meat</span><span class="font8"> proteins, using only such proteins as clabber milk, cottage cheese, buttermilk, milk, etc., some avocado and cream. Also included in this step after the first two days is the elimination of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">cooked</span><span class="font8"> vegetables. The diet at this stage consists of only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">raw</span><span class="font8"> vegetables and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">raw</span><span class="font8"> fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Step 4 consists of elimination of the raw </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">vegetables,</span><span class="font8"> using only raw </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">fruits.</span><span class="font8"> One kind of fruit in a day, preferably, and in some cases the use of different fruits for each meal, may be permitted. May add protein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Step 3 is the use of only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">raw fruits,</span><span class="font8"> one kind in a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Step 2 is variable with different types of patients. There are a few people who cannot use milk, as in certain forms of liver trouble, gallbladder trouble, etc., and should use buttermilk instead. Step 1 is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">acid fruit juice.</span><span class="font8"> This preparatory program can be used for three weeks.</span></p>

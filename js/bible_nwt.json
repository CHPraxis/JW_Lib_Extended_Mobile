{"Genesis":[["In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.","Now the earth was formless and desolate,  and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep,  and God’s active force  was moving about over the surface of the waters.","And God said: “Let there be light.” Then there was light.","After that God saw that the light was good, and God began to divide the light from the darkness.","God called the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.","Then God said: “Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let there be a division between the waters and the waters.”","Then God went on to make the expanse and divided the waters beneath the expanse from the waters above the expanse. And it was so.","God called the expanse Heaven.  And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.","Then God said: “Let the waters under the heavens be collected together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.","God called the dry land Earth, but the collecting of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.","Then God said: “Let the earth cause grass to sprout, seed-bearing plants and fruit trees according to their kinds, yielding fruit along with seed on the earth.” And it was so.","And the earth began to produce grass, seed-bearing plants and trees yielding fruit along with seed, according to their kinds. Then God saw that it was good.","And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.","Then God said: “Let there be luminaries  in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night, and they will serve as signs for seasons and for days and years.","They will serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.","And God went on to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.","Thus God put them in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth","and to dominate by day and by night and to make a division between the light and the darkness. Then God saw that it was good.","And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.","Then God said: “Let the waters swarm with living creatures,  and let flying creatures fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”","And God created the great sea creatures  and all living creatures  that move and swarm in the waters according to their kinds and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.","With that God blessed them, saying: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the waters of the sea, and let the flying creatures become many in the earth.”","And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.","Then God said: “Let the earth bring forth living creatures  according to their kinds, domestic animals and creeping animals  and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.","And God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds and the domestic animals according to their kinds and all the creeping animals of the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.","Then God said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.”","And God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.","Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.”","Then God said: “Here I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you.","And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life,  I have given all green vegetation for food.” And it was so.","After that God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day."],["Thus the heavens and the earth and everything in them  were completed.","And by the seventh day, God had completed the work that he had been doing,  and he began to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had been doing.","And God went on to bless the seventh day and to declare it sacred, for on it God has been resting from all the work that he has created, all that he purposed to make.","This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time they were created, in the day that Jehovah  God made earth and heaven.","No bush of the field was yet on the earth and no vegetation of the field had begun sprouting, because Jehovah God had  not made it rain on the earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground.","But a mist would go up from the earth, and it watered the entire surface of the ground.","And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.","Further, Jehovah God planted a garden in Eʹden, toward the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.","Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree that was pleasing to look at and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.","Now there was a river flowing out of Eʹden to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers.","The name of the first is Piʹshon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havʹi·lah, where there is gold.","The gold of that land is good. Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there.","The name of the second river is Giʹhon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush.","The name of the third river is Hidʹde·kel;  it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a. And the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes.","Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it.","Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction.","But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”","Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.”","Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature,  that became its name.","So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him.","So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.","And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.","Then the man said:","That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to  his wife, and they will become one flesh.","And both of them continued to be naked, the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed."],["Now the serpent was the most cautious  of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it said to the woman: “Did God really say that  you must not eat from every tree of the garden?”","At this the woman said to the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.","But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden: ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’”","At this the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die.","For God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.”","Consequently, the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something desirable to the eyes, yes, the tree was pleasing to look at. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward, she also gave some to her husband when he was with her, and he began eating it.","Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.","Later they heard the voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden about the breezy part of the day, and the man and his wife hid from the face of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.","And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him: “Where are you?”","Finally he said: “I heard your voice in the garden, but I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.”","At that he said: “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”","The man said: “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate.”","Jehovah God then said to the woman: “What is this you have done?” The woman replied: “The serpent deceived me, so I ate.”","Then Jehovah God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are the cursed one out of all the domestic animals and out of all the wild animals of the field. On your belly you will go, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.","And I will put enmity  between you and the woman and between your offspring  and her offspring.  He will crush  your head, and you will strike  him in the heel.”","To the woman he said: “I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children, and your longing will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.”","And to Adam  he said: “Because you listened to your wife’s voice and ate from the tree concerning which I gave you this command, ‘You must not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on your account. In pain you will eat its produce all the days of your life.","It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you must eat the vegetation of the field.","In the sweat of your face you will eat bread  until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”","After this Adam named his wife Eve,  because she was to become the mother of everyone living.","And Jehovah God made long garments from skins for Adam and for his wife, to clothe them.","Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing  good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever, —”","With that Jehovah God expelled him from the garden of Eʹden to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.","So he drove the man out, and he posted at the east of the garden of Eʹden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life."],["Now Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said: “I have produced  a male child with the help of Jehovah.”","Later she again gave birth, to his brother Abel.","After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah.","But Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat. While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering,","he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering. So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.","Then Jehovah said to Cain: “Why are you so angry and dejected?","If you turn to doing good, will you not be restored to favor?  But if you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door, and its craving is to dominate you; but will you get the mastery over it?”","After that Cain said to his brother Abel: “Let us go over into the field.” So while they were in the field, Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him.","Later on, Jehovah said to Cain: “Where is your brother Abel?” and he said: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?”","At this He said: “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.","And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.","When you cultivate the ground, it will not give you back its produce.  You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth.”","At this Cain said to Jehovah: “The punishment for my error is too great to bear.","Today you are driving me from the land,  and I will be hidden from your face; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me.”","So Jehovah said to him: “For that reason, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times.”","Then Cain went away from before Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Exile,  to the east of Eʹden.","Afterward Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Eʹnoch. Then he engaged in building a city and named the city after his son Eʹnoch.","Later Iʹrad was born to Eʹnoch. And Iʹrad became father to Me·huʹja·el, and Me·huʹja·el became father to Me·thuʹsha·el, and Me·thuʹsha·el became father to Laʹmech.","Laʹmech took two wives for himself. The name of the first  was Aʹdah, and the name of the second was Zilʹlah.","Aʹdah gave birth to Jaʹbal. He was the founder of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.","His brother’s name was Juʹbal. He was the founder of all those who play the harp and the pipe.","Also, Zilʹlah gave birth to Tuʹbal-cain, who forged every sort of tool of copper and iron. And the sister of Tuʹbal-cain was Naʹa·mah.","Then Laʹmech composed these words for his wives Aʹdah and Zilʹlah:","If 7 times Cain is to be avenged,","Adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth  because, as she said, “God has appointed for me another offspring  in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.”","There was also born to Seth a son, and he named him Eʹnosh. At that time people began calling on the name of Jehovah."],["This is the book of Adam’s history. In the day that God created Adam, he made him in the likeness of God.","Male and female he created them. On the day they were created, he blessed them and named them Man.","Adam lived for 130 years and then became father to a son in his likeness, in his image, and he named him Seth.","After becoming father to Seth, Adam lived for 800 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Adam’s life amounted to 930 years, and then he died.","Seth lived for 105 years and then became father to Eʹnosh.","After becoming father to Eʹnosh, Seth lived for 807 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Seth amounted to 912 years, and then he died.","Eʹnosh lived for 90 years and then became father to Keʹnan.","After becoming father to Keʹnan, Eʹnosh lived for 815 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Eʹnosh amounted to 905 years, and then he died.","Keʹnan lived for 70 years and then became father to Ma·halʹa·lel.","After becoming father to Ma·halʹa·lel, Keʹnan lived for 840 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Keʹnan amounted to 910 years, and then he died.","Ma·halʹa·lel lived for 65 years and then became father to Jaʹred.","After becoming father to Jaʹred, Ma·halʹa·lel lived for 830 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Ma·halʹa·lel amounted to 895 years, and then he died.","Jaʹred lived for 162 years and then became father to Eʹnoch.","After becoming father to Eʹnoch, Jaʹred lived for 800 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Jaʹred amounted to 962 years, and then he died.","Eʹnoch lived for 65 years and then became father to Me·thuʹse·lah.","After becoming father to Me·thuʹse·lah, Eʹnoch  continued to walk with the true God  for 300 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Eʹnoch amounted to 365 years.","Eʹnoch kept walking with the true God. Then he was no more, for God took him.","Me·thuʹse·lah lived for 187 years and then became father to Laʹmech.","After becoming father to Laʹmech, Me·thuʹse·lah lived for 782 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Me·thuʹse·lah amounted to 969 years, and then he died.","Laʹmech lived for 182 years and then became father to a son.","He named him Noah,  saying: “This one will bring us comfort  from our labor and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.”","After becoming father to Noah, Laʹmech lived for 595 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","So all the days of Laʹmech amounted to 777 years, and then he died.","After Noah reached 500 years of age, he became father to Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth."],["Now when men started to grow in number on the surface of the ground and daughters were born to them,","the sons of the true God  began to notice that the daughters of men were beautiful. So they began taking as wives all whom they chose.","Then Jehovah said: “My spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely, because he is only flesh.  Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.”","The Nephʹi·lim  were on the earth in those days and afterward. During that time the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men, and these bore sons to them. They were the mighty ones of old times, the men of fame.","Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.","Jehovah regretted  that he had made men on the earth, and his heart was saddened.","So Jehovah said: “I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the surface of the ground, man together with domestic animals, creeping animals, and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret that I have made them.”","But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.","This is the history of Noah.","In time Noah became father to three sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth.","But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God, and the earth was filled with violence.","Yes, God looked upon the earth, and it was ruined; all flesh  had ruined its way on the earth.","After that God said to Noah: “I have decided to put an end to all flesh, because the earth is full of violence on account of them, so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.","Make for yourself an  ark  from resinous wood. You will make compartments in the ark and cover it with tar  inside and outside.","This is how you will make it: The ark should be 300 cubits  long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.","You will make a window for light  for the ark, one cubit from the top.

He did just so."],["After that Jehovah said to Noah: “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because you are the one I have found to be righteous before me among this generation.","You must take with you every kind of clean animal by sevens,  the male and its mate; and of every animal that is not clean just two, the male and its mate;","also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens,  male and female, to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth.","For in just seven days, I will make it rain on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made.”","Then Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him.","Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.","So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark ahead of the floodwaters.","Of every clean animal and of every animal that is not clean and of the flying creatures and of everything that moves on the ground,","they went inside the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.","And seven days later the floodwaters came upon the earth.","In the 600th year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the 17th day of the month, on that day all the springs of the vast watery deep burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.","And the rain poured down on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights.","On that very day, Noah went into the ark along with his sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth, and his wife and the three wives of his sons.","They went in with every wild animal according  to its kind, and every domestic animal according to its kind, and every creeping animal of the earth according to its kind, and every flying creature according to its kind, every bird, every winged creature.","They kept going to Noah inside the ark, two by two, of every sort of flesh that has the breath of life.","So they went in, male and female of every sort of flesh, just as God had commanded him.

They were all wiped off the earth; only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.","And the waters continued overwhelming the earth for 150 days."],["But God gave attention to  Noah and to all the wild animals and domestic animals that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the waters began to subside.","The springs of the watery deep and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up, so the rain from the heavens stopped falling.","Then the waters began to recede progressively from the earth. By the end of 150 days, the waters had subsided.","In the seventh month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Arʹa·rat.","And the waters were steadily decreasing until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.","So at the end of 40 days, Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark","and sent out a raven; it continued flying outside and returning, until the waters dried off the earth.","Later he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.","The dove did not find any resting-place to perch,  so it returned to him into the ark because the waters were still covering the surface of the whole earth. So he reached his hand out and brought it inside the ark.","He waited seven more days, and once again he sent out the dove from the ark.","When the dove came to him toward evening, he saw that there was a freshly plucked olive leaf in its bill! So Noah knew that the waters had receded  from the earth.","He waited still another seven days. Then he sent out the dove, but it did not return to him anymore.","Now in the 601st year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters had drained from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.","In the second month, on the 27th day of the month, the earth had dried off.","God now said to Noah:","“Go out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives.","Bring out with you all the living creatures of every sort of flesh, of the flying creatures and of the animals and of all the creeping animals of the earth, that they may multiply  on the earth and be fruitful and become many on the earth.”","So Noah went out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.","Every living creature, every creeping animal and every flying creature, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.","Then Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took some of all the clean animals and of all the clean flying creatures and offered burnt offerings on the altar.","And Jehovah began to smell a pleasing  aroma. So Jehovah said in his heart: “Never again will I curse  the ground on man’s account, for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again will I strike down every living thing as I have done.","From now on, the earth will never cease to have seed-sowing and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night.”"],["God went on to bless Noah and his sons and to say to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.","A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth and upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the ground and upon all the fish of the sea. They are now given into your hand.","Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. Just as I gave you the green vegetation, I give them all to you.","Only flesh with its life —its blood—you must not eat.","Besides that, I will demand an accounting for your lifeblood.  I will demand an accounting from every living creature; and from each man I will demand an accounting for the life of his brother.","Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image He made man.","As for you, be fruitful and become many, and increase abundantly on the earth and multiply.”","Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:","“I am now establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,","and with every living creature  that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the living creatures of the earth with you, all those that came out of the ark—every living creature of the earth.","Yes, I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all flesh  be destroyed by the waters of a flood, and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.”","And God added: “This is the sign of the covenant that I  am making between me and you and every living creature  that is with you, for all future generations.","I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.","Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.","And I will certainly remember my covenant that I made between me and you and every living creature of every kind;  and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.","And the rainbow will occur in the cloud, and I will certainly see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind  on the earth.”","God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I establish between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”","Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth. Ham later became the father of Caʹnaan.","These three were Noah’s sons, and all the earth’s population came from them and spread abroad.","Now Noah started off as a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.","When he drank of the wine, he became intoxicated, and he uncovered himself inside his tent.","Ham, the father of Caʹnaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside.","So Shem and Jaʹpheth took a garment and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backward. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness while their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.","When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,","he said:","And he added:","Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth,","Noah continued to live for 350 years after the Flood.","So all the days of Noah amounted to 950 years, and he died."],["This is the history of Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth.","The sons of Jaʹpheth were Goʹmer, Maʹgog, Maʹda·i, Jaʹvan, Tuʹbal, Meʹshech, and Tiʹras.","The sons of Goʹmer were Ashʹke·naz, Riʹphath, and To·garʹmah.","The sons of Jaʹvan were E·liʹshah, Tarʹshish, Kitʹtim, and Doʹda·nim.","From these the inhabitants of the islands spread into their lands, according to their languages and their families and by their nations.","The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizʹra·im, Put, and Caʹnaan.","The sons of Cush were Seʹba, Havʹi·lah, Sabʹtah, Raʹa·mah, and Sabʹte·ca.","Cush became father to Nimʹrod.

Let us make bricks and bake them with fire.” So they used bricks instead of stone, and bitumen as mortar.","They now said: “Come! Let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, so that we will not be scattered over the entire face of the earth.”","Then Jehovah went down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built.","Jehovah then said: “Look! They are one people with one language, and this is what they have started to do. Now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them.","Come! Let us go down there and confuse their language in order that they may not understand one another’s language.”","So Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city.","That is why it was named Baʹbel,  because there Jehovah confused the language of all the earth, and Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth.","This is the history of Shem.","After becoming father to Ar·pachʹshad, Shem continued to live 500 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","Ar·pachʹshad lived for 35 years and then became father to Sheʹlah.","After becoming father to Sheʹlah, Ar·pachʹshad continued to live 403 years.

And he became father to sons and daughters.","Reʹu lived for 32 years and then became father to Seʹrug.","After becoming father to Seʹrug, Reʹu continued to live 207 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","Seʹrug lived for 30 years and then became father to Naʹhor.","After becoming father to Naʹhor, Seʹrug continued to live 200 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","Naʹhor lived for 29 years and then became father to Teʹrah.","After becoming father to Teʹrah, Naʹhor continued to live 119 years. And he became father to sons and daughters.","Teʹrah lived for 70 years, after which he became father to Aʹbram, Naʹhor, and Haʹran.","This is the history of Teʹrah.","While his father Teʹrah was still alive, Haʹran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chal·deʹans.","Aʹbram and Naʹhor took wives for themselves. The name of Aʹbram’s wife was Sarʹai, and the name of Naʹhor’s wife was Milʹcah, the daughter of Haʹran, the father of Milʹcah and Isʹcah.","Now Sarʹai was barren; she had no child.","Teʹrah then took Aʹbram his son and Lot his grandson, the son of Haʹran, and Sarʹai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Aʹbram his son, and they went with him out of Ur of the Chal·deʹans to go to the land of Caʹnaan. In time they came to Haʹran and began dwelling there.","The days of Teʹrah were 205 years. Then Teʹrah died in Haʹran."],["And Jehovah said to Aʹbram: “Go out from your land and away from your relatives and from the house of your father to the land that I will show you.","I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will become a blessing.","I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who calls down evil on you, and all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed  by means of you.”","So Aʹbram went just as Jehovah had told him, and Lot went with him. Aʹbram was 75 years old when he left Haʹran.","Aʹbram took his wife Sarʹai and Lot the son of his brother and all the goods that they had accumulated and the people  whom they had acquired in Haʹran, and they set out for the land of Caʹnaan. When they reached the land of Caʹnaan,","Aʹbram traveled through the land as far as the site of Sheʹchem, near the big trees of Moʹreh. At that time the Caʹnaan·ites were in the land.","Jehovah then appeared to Aʹbram and said: “To your offspring  I am going to give this land.” So he built an altar there to Jehovah, who had appeared to him.","Later he moved from there to the mountainous region east of Bethʹel and pitched his tent with Bethʹel on the west and Aʹi on the east. There he built an altar to Jehovah and began to call on the name of Jehovah.","Afterward, Aʹbram broke camp and journeyed toward the Negʹeb, moving his camp from one place to another.","Now a famine arose in the land, and Aʹbram went down toward Egypt to reside there for a while,  because the famine in the land was severe.","As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarʹai: “Please listen! I know what a beautiful woman you are.","So when the Egyptians see you, they will surely say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but keep you alive.","Please say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and my life will be spared.”","As soon as Aʹbram entered Egypt, the Egyptians noticed that the woman was very beautiful.","And the princes of Pharʹaoh also saw her, and they began praising her to Pharʹaoh, so that the woman was taken to the house of Pharʹaoh.","He treated Aʹbram well because of her, and he acquired sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.","Then Jehovah struck Pharʹaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Sarʹai, Aʹbram’s wife.","So Pharʹaoh called Aʹbram and said: “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?","Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I was about to take her as my wife? Here is your wife. Take her and go!”","So Pharʹaoh gave his men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had."],["Aʹbram then went up out of Egypt to the Negʹeb, he and his wife and all that he had, together with Lot.","Aʹbram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.","He camped in one place after another as he traveled from the Negʹeb to Bethʹel, until he arrived at the place where his tent had been between  Bethʹel and Aʹi,","to the place where he had previously built an altar. There Aʹbram called on the name of Jehovah.","Now Lot, who was traveling with Aʹbram, also owned sheep, cattle, and tents.","So the land did not allow for all of them to stay in the same place; their goods had become so many that they could no longer dwell together.","As a result, a quarrel arose between the herders of Aʹbram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock. (At that time the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites were dwelling in the land.)","So Aʹbram said to Lot: “Please, there should be no quarreling between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.","Is not the whole land available to you? Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.”","So Lot raised his eyes and saw that the whole district of the Jordan was a well-watered region (before Jehovah destroyed Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as far as Zoʹar.","Then Lot chose for himself the whole district of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east. So they separated from each other.","Aʹbram lived in the land of Caʹnaan, but Lot lived among the cities of the district. Finally he set up his tent near Sodʹom.","Now the men of Sodʹom were wicked, gross sinners against Jehovah.","Jehovah said to Aʹbram, after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, to the north and south, east and west,","because all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring  as a lasting possession.","And I will make your offspring  like the dust particles of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth, then your offspring  could be counted.","Get up, travel through the length and breadth of the land, for to you I am going to give it.”","So Aʹbram continued to live in tents. Later he came and dwelled among the big trees of Mamʹre, which are in Hebʹron, and there he built an altar to Jehovah."],["Now in the days of Amʹra·phel king of Shiʹnar, Arʹi·och king of El·laʹsar, Ched·or·la·oʹmer king of Eʹlam, and Tiʹdal king of Goiʹim,","these made war with Beʹra king of Sodʹom, Birʹsha king of Go·morʹrah, Shiʹnab king of Adʹmah, Shem·eʹber king of Ze·boiʹim, and the king of Beʹla, that is, Zoʹar.","All of these joined forces at the Valley  of Sidʹdim, that is, the Salt Sea.","They had served Ched·or·la·oʹmer for 12 years, but they rebelled in the 13th year.","So in the 14th year, Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephʹa·im in Ashʹte·roth-kar·naʹim, the Zuʹzim in Ham, the Eʹmim in Shaʹveh-kir·i·a·thaʹim,","and the Horʹites in their mountain of Seʹir down to El-paʹran, which is at the wilderness.","Then they turned back and came to En-mishʹpat, that is, Kaʹdesh, and conquered the whole territory of the A·malʹek·ites and also the Amʹor·ites who were dwelling in Hazʹa·zon-taʹmar.","At this point, the king of Sodʹom went on the march, and also the king of Go·morʹrah,  the king of Adʹmah, the king of Ze·boiʹim, and the king of Beʹla, that is, Zoʹar, and they drew up in battle formation against them in the Valley  of Sidʹdim,","against Ched·or·la·oʹmer king of Eʹlam, Tiʹdal king of Goiʹim, Amʹra·phel king of Shiʹnar, and Arʹi·och king of El·laʹsar—four kings against the five.","Now the Valley  of Sidʹdim was full of bitumen pits, and the kings of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah tried to escape and fell into them, and those who remained fled to the mountainous region.","Then the victors took all the goods of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and all their food and went on their way.","They also took Lot, the son of Aʹbram’s brother who was dwelling in Sodʹom, as well as his goods, and they continued on their way.","After that a man who had escaped came and told Aʹbram the Hebrew. He was then dwelling  among the big trees of Mamʹre the Amʹor·ite, the brother of Eshʹcol and Aʹner. These men were allies of Aʹbram.","Thus Aʹbram heard that his relative  had been taken captive. With that he mobilized his trained men, 318 servants born in his household, and went in pursuit up to Dan.","During the night, he divided his forces, and he and his servants attacked and defeated them. And he pursued them up to Hoʹbah, which is north of Damascus.","He recovered all the goods, and he also recovered Lot his relative, his goods, the women, and the other people.","After Aʹbram returned from defeating Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodʹom went out to meet Aʹbram at the Valley  of Shaʹveh, that is, the Valley of the King.","And Mel·chizʹe·dek king of Saʹlem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of the Most High God.","Then he blessed him and said:","And praised be the Most High God,","After that the king of Sodʹom said to Aʹbram: “Give me the people,  but take the goods for yourself.”","But Aʹbram said to the king of Sodʹom: “I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth,","that I will not take anything that is yours, from a thread to a sandal lace, so that you may not say, ‘I made Aʹbram rich.’","I will take nothing except what the young men have already eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me, Aʹner, Eshʹcol, and Mamʹre—let them take their share.”"],["After this the word of Jehovah came to Aʹbram in a vision, saying: “Do not fear, Aʹbram. I am a shield for you. Your reward will be very great.”","Aʹbram replied: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, what will you give me, seeing that I continue childless and the one who will inherit my house is a man of Damascus, E·li·eʹzer?”","Aʹbram added: “You have given me no offspring,  and a member  of my household is succeeding me as heir.”","But look! Jehovah’s  word in reply to him was, “This man will not succeed you as heir, but your own son  will succeed you as heir.”","He now brought him outside and said: “Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to do so.” Then he said to him: “So your offspring  will become.”","And he put faith in Jehovah, and He counted  it to him as righteousness.","Then he added: “I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chal·deʹans to give you this land as your possession.”","To this he said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, how will I know that I will take possession of it?”","He replied to him: “Take for me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”","So he took all of these and cut them in two and put each part opposite the other,  but he did not cut up the birds.","Then the birds of prey began to descend on the carcasses, but Aʹbram kept driving them away.","When the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Aʹbram and a great and frightening darkness descended on him.","Then He said to Aʹbram: “Know for certain that your offspring  will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years.","But I will judge the nation they will serve, and after that they will go out with many goods.","As for you, you will go to your forefathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.","But they will return here in the fourth generation, because the error of the Amʹor·ites has not yet reached its full measure.”","When the sun had set and it had become very dark, a smoking furnace appeared, and a fiery torch passed between the pieces.","On that day Jehovah made with Aʹbram a covenant, saying: “To your offspring  I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Eu·phraʹtes:","the land of the Kenʹites, the Kenʹiz·zites, the Kadʹmon·ites,","the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Rephʹa·im,","the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Girʹga·shites, and the Jebʹu·sites.”"],["Now Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian servant whose name was Haʹgar.","So Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “Please now! Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children. Please, have relations with my servant. Perhaps I can have children by means of her.” So Aʹbram listened to what Sarʹai said.","After Aʹbram had lived for ten years in the land of Caʹnaan, Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai took her Egyptian servant Haʹgar and gave her to her husband Aʹbram as his wife.","So he had relations with Haʹgar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.","At this Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “The injury done to me is your fault. I was the one who put my servant in your arms,  but when she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise me. May Jehovah judge between me and you.”","So Aʹbram said to Sarʹai: “Look! Your servant is under  your authority. Do to her whatever you think is best.” Then Sarʹai humiliated her, and she ran away from her.","Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.","And he said: “Haʹgar, servant of Sarʹai, where have you come from and where are you going?” To this she said: “I am running away from my mistress Sarʹai.”","Jehovah’s angel then said to her: “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.”","Then Jehovah’s angel said: “I will greatly multiply your offspring,  so that they will be too numerous to count.”","Jehovah’s angel added: “Here you are pregnant, and you will give birth to a son, and you must name him Ishʹma·el,  for Jehovah has heard your affliction.","He will be a wild donkey  of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him, and he will dwell opposite all his brothers.”","Then she called on the name of Jehovah, who was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,” for she said: “Have I here actually looked upon the one who sees me?”","That is why the well was called Beʹer-laʹhai-roi.  (It is between Kaʹdesh and Beʹred.)","So Haʹgar bore to Aʹbram a son, and Aʹbram named his son, whom Haʹgar bore, Ishʹma·el.","Aʹbram was 86 years old when Haʹgar bore Ishʹma·el to him."],["When Aʹbram was 99 years old, Jehovah appeared to Aʹbram and said to him: “I am God Almighty. Walk before me and prove yourself faultless.","I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you very, very much.”","At this Aʹbram fell facedown, and God continued to speak with him, saying:","“As for me, look! my covenant is with you, and you will certainly become a father of many nations.","Your name will no longer be Aʹbram;  your name will become Abraham,  for I will make you a father of many nations.","I will make you very, very fruitful and will make you become nations, and kings will come from you.","“And I will keep my covenant between me and you and your offspring  after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring  after you.","And I will give to you and to your offspring  after you the land in which you lived as a foreigner—the entire land of Caʹnaan—for a lasting possession, and I will be their God.”","God said further to Abraham: “As for you, you are to keep my covenant, you and your offspring  after you throughout their generations.","This is my covenant between me and you, that you and your offspring  after you will keep: Every male among you must get circumcised.","You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.","Throughout your generations, every male among you  eight days old must be circumcised, anyone who is born in the house and anyone who is not one of your offspring  and who was purchased with money from a foreigner.","Every man born in your house and every man purchased with your money must be circumcised, and my covenant in your flesh must serve as a lasting covenant.","If any uncircumcised male will not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person  must be cut off  from his people. He has broken my covenant.”","Then God said to Abraham: “As for your wife Sarʹai,  you must not call her Sarʹai, because Sarah  will become her name.","I will bless her and also give you a son by her; I will bless her and she will become nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”","At this Abraham fell facedown and began to laugh and to say in his heart: “Will a man 100 years old have a child born to him, and will Sarah, a woman 90 years old, give birth?”","So Abraham said to the true God: “O that Ishʹma·el might live before you!”","To this God said: “Your wife Sarah will definitely bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac.  And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant to his offspring  after him.","But as regards Ishʹma·el, I have heard you. Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. He will produce 12 chieftains, and I will make him become a great nation.","However, I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time next year.”","When God finished speaking with him, he went up from Abraham.","Abraham then took Ishʹma·el his son and all the men born in his house and everyone he had purchased with money, every male in the household of Abraham, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day, just as God had spoken with him.","Abraham was 99 years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.","And Ishʹma·el his son was 13 years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.","On that very day, Abraham was circumcised and also his son Ishʹma·el.","All the men of his household, anyone born in the house and anyone purchased with money from a foreigner, were also circumcised with him."],["Afterward, Jehovah appeared to him among the big trees of Mamʹre while he was sitting at the entrance of the tent during the hottest part of the day.","He looked up and saw three men standing some distance from him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground.","Then he said: “Jehovah, if I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.","Please, let a little water be brought and have your feet washed; then recline under the tree.","Seeing that you have come here to your servant, let me bring a piece of bread so that you may refresh yourselves.  Then you may go on your way.” At this they said: “All right. You may do as you have spoken.”","So Abraham hurried to the tent to Sarah and said: “Quick! Get three measures  of fine flour, knead the dough, and make loaves of bread.”","Next Abraham ran to the herd and chose a tender and good young bull. He gave it to the attendant, who hurried to prepare it.","He then took butter and milk and the young bull that he had prepared and set the food before them. Then he stood by them under the tree as they were eating.","They said to him: “Where is your wife Sarah?” He replied: “Here in the tent.”","So one of them continued: “I will surely return to you next year at this time, and look! your wife Sarah will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the tent entrance, which was behind the man.","Abraham and Sarah were old, being advanced in years. Sarah was past the age of childbearing.","So Sarah began to laugh to herself, saying: “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I really have this pleasure?”","Then Jehovah said to Abraham: “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Am I really going to give birth even though I am old?’","Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah? I will return to you next year at this appointed time, and Sarah will have a son.”","But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh!” for she was afraid. At this he said: “Yes! You did laugh.”","When the men got up to leave and looked down toward Sodʹom, Abraham was walking with them to escort them.","Jehovah said: “Am I keeping hidden from Abraham what I am going to do?","Why, Abraham is surely going to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed  by means of him.","For I have come to know him in order that he may command his sons and his household after him to keep Jehovah’s way by doing what is right and just, so that Jehovah may bring about what he has promised concerning Abraham.”","Then Jehovah said: “The outcry against Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah is indeed great, and their sin is very heavy.","I will go down to see whether they are acting according to the outcry that has reached me. And if not, I can get to know it.”","Then the men left from there and went toward Sodʹom, but Jehovah remained with Abraham.","Then Abraham approached and said: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?","Suppose there are 50 righteous men within the city. Will you, then, sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50 righteous who are inside it?","It is unthinkable that you would act in this manner by putting the righteous man to death with the wicked one so that the outcome for the righteous man and the wicked is the same! It is unthinkable of you. Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?”","Then Jehovah said: “If I find in Sodʹom 50 righteous men in the city, I will pardon the whole place for their sake.”","But Abraham again responded: “Please, here I have presumed to speak to Jehovah, whereas I am dust and ashes.","Suppose the 50 righteous should lack five. Because of the five will you destroy the whole  city?” To this he said: “I will not destroy it if I find there 45.”","But yet again he spoke to him and said: “Suppose 40 are found there.” He answered: “I will not do it for the sake of the 40.”","But he continued: “Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger, but let me go on speaking: Suppose only 30 are found there.” He answered: “I will not do it if I find 30 there.”","But he continued: “Please, here I have presumed to speak to Jehovah: Suppose only 20 are found there.” He answered: “I will not destroy it for the sake of the 20.”","Finally he said: “Jehovah, please, do not become hot with anger, but let me speak just once more: Suppose only ten are found there.” He answered: “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.”","When Jehovah finished speaking to Abraham, he went his way and Abraham returned to his place."],["The two angels arrived at Sodʹom by evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodʹom. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the earth.","And he said: “Please, my lords, turn aside, please, into the house of your servant and stay overnight and have your feet washed. Then you may get up early and travel on your way.” To this they said: “No, we will stay overnight in the public square.”","But he was so insistent with them that they went with him to his house. Then he made a feast for them, and he baked unleavened bread, and they ate.","Before they could lie down to sleep, the men of the city—the men of Sodʹom from boy to old man, all of them—surrounded the house in one mob.","And they kept calling out to Lot and saying to him: “Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may have sex with them.”","Then Lot went out to them to the doorway, and he shut the door behind him.","He said: “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.","Please, here I have two daughters who have never had sexual relations with a man. Please, let me bring them out to you for you to do to them whatever seems good to you. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come under the shelter  of my roof.”","At this they said: “Stand back!” And they added: “This lone foreigner came to live here, and yet he dares to judge us! Now we are going to do worse to you than to them.” And they crowded in  on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.","So the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and they shut the door.","But they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the least to the greatest, so that they wore themselves out trying to find the doorway.","Then the men said to Lot: “Do you have anyone else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and all your people in the city, bring out of this place!","For we are going to destroy this place, because the outcry against them has indeed grown great  before Jehovah, so that Jehovah sent us to destroy the city.”","So Lot went out and began to speak to his sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters, and he kept saying: “Get up! Get out of this place, because Jehovah will destroy the city!” But to his sons-in-law, he seemed to be joking.","As dawn was breaking, the angels became urgent with Lot, saying: “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you, so that you will not be swept away in the error of the city!”","When he kept lingering, then because of Jehovah’s compassion for him, the men seized hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, and they brought him out and stationed him outside the city.","As soon as they had brought them to the outskirts, he said: “Escape for your life!  Do not look behind you and do not stand still in any part of the district! Escape to the mountainous region so that you may not be swept away!”","Then Lot said to them: “Not there, please, Jehovah!","Please, now, your servant has found favor in your eyes and you are showing great kindness  to me by preserving me  alive, but I am not able to flee to the mountainous region because I am afraid that disaster may overtake me and I will die.","Please, now, this town is nearby and I can flee there; it is only a small place. May I, please, escape there? It is only a small place. Then I will survive.”","So he said to him: “Very well, I will also show you consideration by not overthrowing the town you speak of.","Hurry! Escape there, because I cannot do anything until you arrive there!” That is why he named the town Zoʹar.","The sun had risen over the land when Lot arrived at Zoʹar.","Then Jehovah made it rain sulfur and fire on Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah—it came from Jehovah, from the heavens.","So he overthrew these cities, yes, the entire district, including all the inhabitants of the cities and the plants of the ground.","But Lot’s wife, who was behind him, began to look back, and she became a pillar of salt.","Now Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.","When he looked down toward Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and all the land of the district, he saw quite a sight. There was dense smoke rising from the land like the dense smoke of a kiln!","So when God destroyed the cities of the district, God kept Abraham in mind by sending Lot out from the cities he overthrew, the cities where Lot had been dwelling.","Later Lot went up from Zoʹar with his two daughters and began living in the mountainous region, because he was afraid to live in Zoʹar. So he began living in a cave with his two daughters.","And the firstborn said to the younger: “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the land to have relations with us according to the custom of the whole earth.","Come, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie down with him and preserve offspring from our father.”","So that night they kept giving their father wine to drink; then the firstborn went in and lay down with her father, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up.","Then on the next day, the firstborn said to the younger: “Here I lay down with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink tonight also. Then you go in and lie down with him, and let us preserve offspring from our father.”","So that night also, they repeatedly gave their father wine  to drink; then the younger went and lay down with him, but he did not know when she lay down and when she got up.","So both daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.","The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moʹab. He is the father of the Moʹab·ites of today.","The younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-amʹmi. He is the father of the Amʹmon·ites of today."],["Now Abraham moved his camp from there to the land of the Negʹeb and began dwelling between Kaʹdesh and Shur. While he was residing  at Geʹrar,","Abraham repeated concerning his wife Sarah: “She is my sister.” So A·bimʹe·lech king of Geʹrar sent for Sarah and took her.","Afterward, God came by night to A·bimʹe·lech in a dream and said to him: “Here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken, since she is married and belongs to another man.”","However, A·bimʹe·lech had not gone near her.  So he said: “Jehovah, will you kill a nation that is really innocent?","Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and did she too not say, ‘He is my brother’? I did this with an honest heart and innocent hands.”","Then the true God said to him in the dream: “I know that you did this with an honest heart, so I held you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her.","Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you and you will keep living. But if you are not returning her, know that you will surely die, you and all who are yours.”","A·bimʹe·lech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things, and they became very frightened.","Then A·bimʹe·lech called Abraham and said to him: “What have you done to us? What sin have I committed against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin? What you have done to me was not right.”","And A·bimʹe·lech went on to say to Abraham: “What were your intentions when you did this thing?”","Abraham said: “It was because I said to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’","And besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.","So when God caused me to wander from the house of my father, I said to her: ‘Let this be how you show loyal love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”","A·bimʹe·lech then took sheep and cattle and male and female servants and gave them to Abraham, and he returned his wife Sarah to him.","A·bimʹe·lech also said: “Here my land is available to you. Dwell wherever you please.”","And to Sarah he said: “Here I give 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother. It is a sign of your innocence  to all who are with you and before everybody, and you are cleared of reproach.”","And Abraham began to make supplication to the true God, and God healed A·bimʹe·lech and his wife and his slave girls, and they began having children;","for Jehovah had made all the women of the house of A·bimʹe·lech  barren  because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife."],["Jehovah turned his attention to Sarah just as he had said, and Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised.","So Sarah became pregnant and then bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time God had promised him.","Abraham named his newborn son, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.","And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him.","Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him.","Then Sarah said: “God has brought me laughter; everybody hearing of it will laugh with me.”","And she added: “Who would have said to Abraham, ‘Sarah will certainly nurse children’? Yet, I have given birth to a son for him in his old age.”","Now the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham prepared a big feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.","But Sarah kept noticing that the son of Haʹgar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, was mocking Isaac.","So she said to Abraham: “Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl is not going to be an heir along with my son, with Isaac!”","But what she said about his son was very displeasing to Abraham.","Then God said to Abraham: “Do not be displeased by what Sarah is saying to you about the boy and about your slave girl. Listen to her,  for what will be called your offspring  will be through Isaac.","As for the son of the slave girl, I will also make a nation out of him, because he is your offspring.”","So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to Haʹgar. He set these on her shoulder and then sent her away along with the boy. So she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beʹer-sheʹba.","Finally the water in the skin bottle was used up, and she pushed the boy under one of the bushes.","Then she went on and sat down by herself, about the distance of a bowshot away, because she said: “I do not want to watch the boy die.” So she sat down at a distance and began to cry aloud and to weep.","At that God heard the voice of the boy, and God’s angel called to Haʹgar from the heavens and said to her: “What is the matter with you, Haʹgar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy there where he is.","Get up, lift the boy and take hold of him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.”","Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the skin bottle with water and gave the boy a drink.","And God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.","He took up dwelling in the wilderness of Paʹran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.","At that time A·bimʹe·lech together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army said to Abraham: “God is with you in everything you are doing.","So now swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me and with my offspring and with my descendants, and that you will deal with me and with the land where you have been residing with the same loyal love that I  have shown you.”","So Abraham said: “I swear to this.”","However, Abraham complained to A·bimʹe·lech about the well of water that the servants of A·bimʹe·lech had violently seized.","A·bimʹe·lech replied: “I do not know who did this; you did not tell me about it, and I heard nothing about it until today.”","At that Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to A·bimʹe·lech, and the two of them made a covenant.","When Abraham set seven female lambs apart from the flock by themselves,","A·bimʹe·lech said to Abraham: “Why have you set these seven female lambs here by themselves?”","Then he said: “You are to accept the seven female lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”","That is why he called that place Beʹer-sheʹba,  because there both of them had taken an oath.","So they made a covenant at Beʹer-sheʹba, after which A·bimʹe·lech got up together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines.","After that he planted a tamarisk tree at Beʹer-sheʹba, and there he called on the name of Jehovah, the everlasting God.","And Abraham stayed  in the land of the Phi·lisʹtines for a long time."],["Now after this the true God put Abraham to the test, and he said to him: “Abraham!” to which he replied: “Here I am!”","Then he said: “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and travel to the land of Mo·riʹah and offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will designate to you.”","So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his servants along with him and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and then he rose and traveled to the place that the true God indicated to him.","On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place from a distance.","Abraham now said to his servants: “You stay here with the donkey, but the boy and I will go over there and worship and return to you.”","So Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he took in his hands the fire and the knife,  and the two of them walked on together.","Then Isaac said to his father Abraham: “My father!” He replied: “Yes, my son!” So he continued: “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?”","To this Abraham said: “God himself will provide the sheep for the burnt offering, my son.” And both of them walked on together.","Finally they reached the place that the true God had indicated to him, and Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac hand and foot and put him on the altar on top of the wood.","Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife  to kill his son.","But Jehovah’s angel called to him from the heavens and said: “Abraham, Abraham!” to which he answered: “Here I am!”","Then he said: “Do not harm the boy, and do not do anything at all to him, for now I do know that you are God-fearing because you have not withheld your  son, your only one, from me.”","At that Abraham looked up, and there just beyond him was a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son.","And Abraham named that place Je·hoʹvah-jiʹreh.  This is why it is still said today: “In the mountain of Jehovah it will be provided.”","And Jehovah’s angel called to Abraham a second time from the heavens,","saying: “‘By myself I swear,’ declares Jehovah, ‘that because you have done this and you have not withheld your son, your only one,","I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your offspring  like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand on the seashore, and your offspring  will take possession of the gate  of his enemies.","And by means of your offspring  all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves because you have listened to my voice.’”","After that Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went back together to Beʹer-sheʹba; and Abraham continued to dwell at Beʹer-sheʹba.","After this it was reported to Abraham: “Here Milʹcah has also borne sons to Naʹhor your brother:","Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kem·uʹel the father of Aʹram,","Cheʹsed, Haʹzo, Pilʹdash, Jidʹlaph, and Be·thuʹel.”","Be·thuʹel became the father of Re·bekʹah. Milʹcah bore these eight to Naʹhor the brother of Abraham.","His concubine, whose name was Reuʹmah, also bore sons: Teʹbah, Gaʹham, Taʹhash, and Maʹa·cah."],["And Sarah lived for 127 years; these were the years of Sarah’s life.","So Sarah died in Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, in the land of Caʹnaan, and Abraham began to mourn and to weep over Sarah.","Then Abraham got up from before his dead wife and he said to the sons of Heth:","“I am a foreigner and settler among you. Give me a property to serve as a burial place in your midst so that I may remove my dead for burial.”","At this the sons of Heth answered Abraham:","“Hear us, my lord. You are a chieftain of God  among us. You may bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will hold back his burial place from you to prevent you from burying your dead.”","So Abraham got up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,","and said to them: “If you  agree to let me remove my dead for burial, then listen to me and urge Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar","to sell me the cave of Mach·peʹlah, which belongs to him; it is at the edge of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence for the full amount of silver so that I may have a property for a burial place.”","Now Eʹphron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So Eʹphron the Hitʹtite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth, and before all who entered the gate of his city, saying:","“No, my lord! Listen to me. I give you both the field and the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people, I give it to you. Bury your dead.”","At that Abraham bowed down before the people of the land","and  spoke to Eʹphron in the hearing of the people, saying: “Listen to me, if you will! I will give you the full amount of silver for the field. Take it from me, in order that I may bury my dead there.”","Then Eʹphron answered Abraham:","“My lord, listen to me. This land is worth 400 silver shekels,  but what is that between me and you? So bury your dead.”","Abraham listened to Eʹphron, and Abraham weighed out to Eʹphron the amount of silver that he had mentioned in the hearing of the sons of Heth, 400 silver shekels  according to the weight accepted by the merchants.","Thus the field of Eʹphron in Mach·peʹlah, which was in front of Mamʹre—the field and the cave in it and all the trees within the boundaries of the field—became confirmed as","Abraham’s purchased property in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all those entering the gate of his city.","After that Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Mach·peʹlah in front of Mamʹre, that is, Hebʹron, in the land of Caʹnaan.","Thus the field and the cave that was in it were transferred by the sons of Heth to Abraham as property for a burial place."],["Abraham was now old, advanced in years, and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in everything.","Abraham said to his servant, the oldest one of his household, who was managing all he had: “Please put your hand under my thigh,","and I will make you swear by Jehovah, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Caʹnaan·ites, among whom I am dwelling.","You must go instead to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.”","However, the servant said to him: “What if the woman is not willing to come with me to this land? Must I then return your son to the land from which you came?”","At this Abraham said to him: “See that you do not take my son there.","Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my relatives and who spoke with me and swore to me: ‘To your offspring  I am going to give this land,’ he will send his angel ahead of you, and you will certainly take a wife for my son from there.","But if the woman is unwilling to come with you, you will be free from this oath. But you must not take my son there.”","With that the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.","So the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking along all sorts of good things from his master. Then he went on his way to Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a, to the city of Naʹhor.","He had the camels kneel down at a well of water outside the city. It was about evening, the time when the women would go out to draw water.","Then he said: “Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success this day, and show your loyal love to my master Abraham.","Here I am standing at a spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.","May it happen that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your water jar so that I may take a drink,’ and who  replies, ‘Take a drink, and I will also water your camels,’ let this be the one you choose for your servant Isaac; and by this let me know that you have shown your loyal love to my master.”","Even before he finished speaking, Re·bekʹah, who was the daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of Milʹcah the wife of Naʹhor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.","Now the young woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had had sexual relations with her. She went down to the spring, filled her water jar, and then came back up.","At once the servant ran to meet her and said: “Please give me a little sip of water from your jar.”","In turn she said: “Drink, my lord.” With that she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.","When she finished giving him a drink, she said: “I will also draw water for your camels until they are done drinking.”","So she quickly emptied her jar into the drinking trough and ran again and again to the well to draw water, and she kept drawing water for all his camels.","The whole time the man silently stared at her in amazement, wondering whether Jehovah had made his trip successful or not.","When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out for her a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel  and two bracelets of gold weighing ten shekels,","and he said: “Please tell me, whose daughter are you? Is there any room at your father’s house for us to spend the night?”","At that she said to him: “I am the daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of Milʹcah, whom she bore to Naʹhor.”","And she added: “We have both straw and much fodder and also a place to spend the night.”","Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Jehovah","and said: “May Jehovah be praised, the God of my master Abraham, for he has not abandoned his loyal love and his faithfulness toward my master. Jehovah has guided me to the house of the brothers of my master.”","And the young woman ran to tell her mother’s household about these things.","Now Re·bekʹah had a brother whose name was Laʹban. So Laʹban ran to the man who was outside at the spring.","When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his sister and heard the words of his sister Re·bekʹah, who was saying, “This is the way the man spoke to me,” he came to meet the man, who was still there standing by the camels at the spring.","At once he said: “Come, you who are blessed by Jehovah. Why do you keep standing out here? I have made the house ready and a place for the camels.”","With that the man came into the house, and he  unharnessed the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.","However, when something to eat was set before him, he said: “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” So Laʹban said: “Speak!”","Then he said: “I am Abraham’s servant.","And Jehovah has blessed my master very much, and he has made him very wealthy by giving him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.","Further, Sarah the wife of my master bore a son to my master after she grew old, and he will give him  everything he has.","So my master made me swear, saying: ‘You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Caʹnaan·ites, in whose land I am dwelling.","No, but you will go to the house of my father and to my family, and you must take a wife for my son.’","But I said to my master: ‘What if the woman is unwilling to come with me?’","He said to me: ‘Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and will certainly give success to your journey, and you must take a wife for my son from my family and from the house of my father.","You will be released from your oath to me if you go to my family and they will not give her to you. This will release you from your oath.’","“When I got to the spring today, I said: ‘Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, if you will make my journey successful,","here I am standing at a spring. What must take place is that when a young woman comes out to draw water, I will say, “Please, let me drink a little water from your jar,”","and she will say to me, “You take a drink, and I will also draw water for your camels.” Let that woman be the one whom Jehovah has chosen for the son of my master.’","“Before I was finished speaking in my heart, there was Re·bekʹah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she made her way down to the spring and began to draw water. Then I said to her: ‘Give me a drink, please.’","So she quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said: ‘Take a drink, and I will also water your camels.’ Then I took a drink, and she also watered the camels.","After that I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ to which she replied, ‘The daughter of Be·thuʹel the son of Naʹhor, whom Milʹcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands.","And I bowed down and prostrated myself before Jehovah and praised Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son.","And now tell me if you wish to show loyal love and faithfulness toward my master; but if not, tell me, so that I may proceed one way or the other.”","Then Laʹban and Be·thuʹel answered: “This is from Jehovah. We are not able to say yes or no to you.","Here is Re·bekʹah before you. Take her and go, and let her become a wife to the son of your master, just as Jehovah has spoken.”","When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he at once bowed down on the ground before Jehovah.","And the servant began to bring out articles of silver and of gold and garments and to give them to Re·bekʹah, and he gave valuable things to her brother and to her mother.","After that he and the men with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there.","To this her brother and her mother said: “Let the young woman stay with us at least ten days. Then she can go.”","But he said to them: “Do not detain me, seeing that Jehovah has made my journey successful. Send me off, in order that I may go to my master.”","So they said: “Let us call the young woman and inquire of her.”","They called Re·bekʹah and said to her:  “Will you go with this man?” She replied: “I am willing to go.”","So they sent off their sister Re·bekʹah and her nurse  and Abraham’s servant and his men.","And they blessed Re·bekʹah and said to her: “Our sister, may you become thousands times ten thousand,  and let your offspring  take possession of the gate  of those who hate them.”","Then Re·bekʹah and her female attendants rose, got on the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Re·bekʹah and went on his way.","Now Isaac had come from the direction of Beʹer-laʹhai-roi, for he was dwelling in the land of the Negʹeb.","And Isaac was out walking in the field about nightfall to meditate. When he looked up, why, he saw that camels were coming!","When Re·bekʹah looked up, she caught sight of Isaac, and she quickly got down from the camel.","Then she asked the servant: “Who is that man there walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said: “It is my master.” So she took her veil to cover herself.","And the servant told Isaac all the things he had done.","After that Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother. Thus he took Re·bekʹah as his wife; and he fell in love with her, and Isaac found comfort after the loss of his mother."],["Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Ke·tuʹrah.","In time she bore him Zimʹran, Jokʹshan, Meʹdan, Midʹi·an, Ishʹbak, and Shuʹah.","Jokʹshan became father to Sheʹba and Deʹdan.","The sons of Midʹi·an were Eʹphah, Eʹpher, Haʹnoch, A·biʹda, and El·daʹah.","Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac,","but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines. Then while he was still alive, he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the land of the East.","The years of Abraham’s life were 175 years.","Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.","His sons Isaac and Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre,","the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah.","After Abraham’s death, God continued to bless his son Isaac, and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi.","This is the history of Ishʹma·el the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah, bore to Abraham.","Now these are the names of the sons of Ishʹma·el, by their names according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s firstborn Ne·baʹioth, then Keʹdar, Adʹbe·el, Mibʹsam,","Mishʹma, Duʹmah, Masʹsa,","Haʹdad, Teʹma, Jeʹtur, Naʹphish, and Kedʹe·mah.","These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments,  12 chieftains according to their clans.","And Ishʹma·el lived for 137 years.  Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people.","And they took up dwelling from Havʹi·lah near Shur, which is close to Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. He settled near all his brothers.","And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham.","Isaac was 40 years old when he married Re·bekʹah, the daughter of Be·thuʹel the A·ra·maeʹan of Padʹdan-aʹram, the sister of Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan.","And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah regarding his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah responded to his plea, and his wife Re·bekʹah became pregnant.","And the sons within her began to struggle with each other, so that she said: “If this is the way it is, why should I go on living?” So she inquired of Jehovah.","And Jehovah said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you; and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation, and the older will serve the younger.”","When the time came for her to give birth, look! twins were in her womb.","Then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair, so they named him Eʹsau.","After that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau, so he named him Jacob.  Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them.","As the boys got bigger, Eʹsau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents.","And Isaac loved Eʹsau because it meant game in his mouth, whereas Re·bekʹah loved Jacob.","On one occasion Jacob was boiling some stew when Eʹsau returned from the field exhausted.","So Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me some  of the red stew that you have there,  for I am exhausted!”  That is why his name was Eʹdom.","To this Jacob said: “First sell me your right as firstborn!”","And Eʹsau continued: “Here I am about to die! What use is a birthright to me?”","And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!” So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob.","Then Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Eʹsau despised the birthright."],["Now there was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that occurred in the days of Abraham, so that Isaac went to A·bimʹe·lech king of the Phi·lisʹtines, in Geʹrar.","Then Jehovah appeared to him and said: “Do not go down to Egypt. Dwell in the land that I designate to you.","Reside as a foreigner in this land, and I will continue with you and bless you because to you and to your offspring  I will give all these lands, and I will carry out the oath that I swore to your father Abraham:","‘I will multiply your offspring  like the stars of the heavens; and I will give to your offspring  all these lands; and by means of your offspring,  all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves,’","on account of the fact that Abraham listened to my voice and continued  to keep my requirements, my commands, my statutes, and my laws.”","So Isaac continued to dwell in Geʹrar.","When the men of the place kept asking about his wife, he would say: “She is my sister.” He was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” for he said, “The men of the place might kill me because of Re·bekʹah,” for she was beautiful in appearance.","After some time had passed, A·bimʹe·lech king of the Phi·lisʹtines was looking out of the window, and he saw Isaac displaying affection for  Re·bekʹah his wife.","At once A·bimʹe·lech called Isaac and said: “She is actually your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” At this Isaac said to him: “I said it for fear I should die because of her.”","But A·bimʹe·lech continued: “What have you done to us? One of the people could easily have lain down with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us!”","Then A·bimʹe·lech commanded all the people, saying: “Anybody touching this man and his wife will surely be put to death!”","And Isaac began to sow seed in that land, and in that year he reaped 100 times what he sowed, for Jehovah was blessing him.","The man became wealthy, and he continued to prosper until he became very wealthy.","He acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants, and the Phi·lisʹtines began to envy him.","So the Phi·lisʹtines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham.","A·bimʹe·lech then said to Isaac: “Move from our neighborhood, for you have grown far stronger than we are.”","So Isaac moved from there and encamped in the valley  of Geʹrar and began dwelling there.","And Isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham but that the Phi·lisʹtines had stopped up after Abraham’s death, and he called them by the names that his father had given them.","When the servants of Isaac were digging in the valley,  they found a well of fresh water.","And the shepherds of Geʹrar began quarreling with the shepherds of Isaac, saying: “The water is ours!” So he named the well Eʹsek,  because they had quarreled with him.","And they started digging another well, and they began quarreling over it also. So he named it Sitʹnah.","Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it. So he named it Re·hoʹboth  and said: “It is because now Jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the land.”","Then he went up from there to Beʹer-sheʹba.","That night Jehovah appeared to him and said: “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your offspring  on account of Abraham my servant.”","So he built an altar there and called on the name of Jehovah. And Isaac pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well there.","Later A·bimʹe·lech came to him from Geʹrar with A·huzʹzath his personal adviser and Phiʹcol the chief of his army.","At this Isaac said to them: “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hated me and sent me  away from your neighborhood?”","To this they said: “We have clearly seen that Jehovah has been with you. So we said, ‘Let there, please, be an oath of obligation between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you","that you will do nothing bad to us just as we have not harmed you, seeing that we have done only good to you in that we sent you away in peace. You now are the blessed of Jehovah.’”","Then he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.","In the morning they got up early and swore an oath to each other. After that Isaac sent them away, and they went from him in peace.","On that day the servants of Isaac came and reported to him about the well that they had dug, and they told him: “We have found water!”","So he named it Shiʹbah. That is why the name of the city is Beʹer-sheʹba to this day.","When Eʹsau was 40 years old, he took as wife Juʹdith the daughter of Be·eʹri the Hitʹtite and also Basʹe·math the daughter of Eʹlon the Hitʹtite.","They were a source of great grief  to Isaac and Re·bekʹah."],["Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see, he called Eʹsau his older son to him and said: “My son!” He replied: “Here I am!”","And he went on to say: “I have now grown old. I do not know the day of my death.","So at this time take, please, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt some wild game for me.","Then make the kind of tasty dish that I am fond of and bring it to me. Then I will eat it so that I  may bless you before I die.”","However, Re·bekʹah was listening while Isaac spoke to Eʹsau his son. And Eʹsau went out into the field to hunt game and to bring it in.","And Re·bekʹah said to Jacob her son: “I just heard your father speaking to your brother Eʹsau, saying,","‘Bring me some game and make me a tasty dish. Then let me eat so that I may bless you before Jehovah before my death.’","And now, my son, listen carefully and do what I am instructing you.","Go, please, to the herd and get me two of the best young goats from there so that I may prepare from them a tasty dish for your father, just the way he likes it.","Then take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before his death.”","Jacob said to his mother Re·bekʹah: “But Eʹsau my brother is a hairy man, and my skin is smooth.","What if my father feels me? Then I will certainly appear to be mocking him, and I will bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.”","At this his mother said to him: “Upon me be the curse meant for you, my son. Just do as I say and go, get them for me.”","So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty dish, just the way his father liked it.","After that Re·bekʹah took her older son Eʹsau’s finest garments, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.","She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the hairless part of his neck.","Then she handed the tasty dish and the bread that she had made to her son Jacob.","So he went in to his father and said: “My father!” to which he said: “Here I am! Who are you, my son?”","Jacob said to  his father: “I am Eʹsau your firstborn. I have done just as you told me. Sit up, please, and eat some of my game, so that you  may bless me.”","At that Isaac said to his son: “How were you so quick in finding it, my son?” He replied: “Because Jehovah your God brought it to me.”","Then Isaac said to Jacob: “Come near, please, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Eʹsau or not.”","So Jacob came near to his father Isaac, and he felt him, after which he said: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Eʹsau.”","He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother Eʹsau. So he blessed him.","After that he asked: “Are you really my son Eʹsau?” to which he replied: “I am.”","Then he said: “Bring me some of the wild game for me to eat, my son, then I  will bless you.” With that he brought it to him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank.","Then Isaac his father said to him: “Come near, please, and kiss me, my son.”","So he came near and kissed him, and he could smell the scent of his garments. Then he blessed him and said:","May the true God give you the dews of the heavens and the fertile soils of the earth and an abundance of grain and new wine.","Let peoples serve you, and let nations bow low to you. Be master over your brothers, and let the sons of your mother bow low to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you.”","Now Isaac had just finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had barely left the presence of his father Isaac when his brother Eʹsau came back from his hunting.","He too prepared a tasty dish and brought it to his father, and he said to his father: “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, in order that you  may bless me.”","At this his father Isaac said to him: “Who are you?” to which he said: “I am your son, your firstborn, Eʹsau.”","And Isaac began to tremble violently, so he said: “Who was it, then, who hunted for game and brought it to me? I already ate it before you arrived, and I blessed him—and he will surely be blessed!”","On hearing his father’s words, Eʹsau began to cry out in an extremely loud and bitter manner and to say to his father: “Bless me, yes, me too, my father!”","But he said: “Your brother came deceitfully so that he might get the blessing meant for you.”","At this he said: “Is he not rightly named Jacob,  that he might supplant me these two times? My birthright he has already taken, and now he has taken my blessing!” Then he added: “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”","But Isaac answered Eʹsau: “Here I have appointed him master over you, and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and I have bestowed grain and new wine for his support. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”","Eʹsau said to his father: “Is there just one blessing that you have, my father? Bless me, yes, me too, my father!” With that  Eʹsau cried loudly and burst into tears.","So his father Isaac answered him:","And by your sword you will live, and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will indeed break his yoke off your neck.”","However, Eʹsau harbored animosity against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him, and Eʹsau kept saying in his heart: “The days of mourning for my father are getting closer. After that I am going to kill Jacob my brother.”","When the words of her older son Eʹsau were told to Re·bekʹah, she at once sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him: “Look! Your brother Eʹsau is planning to take revenge by killing you.","Now, my son, do as I say. Get up and run away to my brother Laʹban at Haʹran.","Dwell with him for a while until your brother’s rage calms down,","until your brother’s anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”","After that Re·bekʹah kept saying to Isaac: “I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what good is my life?”"],["So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, saying: “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Caʹnaan.","Go away to Padʹdan-aʹram to the house of Be·thuʹel, your mother’s father, and from there take for yourself a wife from the daughters of Laʹban, your mother’s brother.","God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples.","And he will give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring  with you, so that you may take possession of the land where you have been living as a foreigner, which God has given to Abraham.”","So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he departed for Padʹdan-aʹram, to Laʹban the son of Be·thuʹel the A·ra·maeʹan, the brother of Re·bekʹah, the mother of Jacob and Eʹsau.","Eʹsau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Padʹdan-aʹram to take a wife from there and that when he blessed him, he commanded him, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Caʹnaan,”","and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and departed for Padʹdan-aʹram.","Eʹsau then realized that the daughters of Caʹnaan were displeasing to his father Isaac,","so Eʹsau went to Ishʹma·el and took as wife Maʹha·lath the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishʹma·el, the sister of Ne·baʹioth, in addition to the other wives he already had.","Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba and kept going toward Haʹran.","In time he came to a place and prepared to spend the night there because the sun had set. So he took one of the stones of that place and set it to rest his head on and lay down there.","Then he had a dream, and look! there was a stairway  set on the earth, and its top reached up to the heavens; and there were God’s angels  ascending and descending on it.","And look! there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he said:","And your offspring  will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by means of you and by means of your offspring  all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed.","I am with you, and I will safeguard you wherever you go, and I will return you to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”","Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said: “Truly Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.”","And he grew fearful and added: “How awe-inspiring this place is! This can only be the house of God, and this is the gate of the heavens.”","So Jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone on which he had rested his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.","So he named that place Bethʹel,  but previously the city’s name was Luz.","Jacob then made a vow, saying: “If God will continue with me and will protect me on my journey and will give me bread to eat and garments to wear","and I return in peace to the house of my father, then Jehovah will certainly have proved to be my God.","And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God, and without fail I will give you a tenth of everything you give to me.”"],["After that Jacob resumed his journey and traveled on to the land of the people of the East.","Now he saw a well in the field and three droves of sheep lying down next to it, because they usually watered the droves from that well. There was a large stone over the mouth of the well.","When all the droves had been gathered there, they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and they watered the flocks, after which they returned the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.","So Jacob said to them: “My brothers, what place are you from?” to which they said: “We are from Haʹran.”","He said to them: “Do you know Laʹban the grandson of Naʹhor?” to which they said: “We know him.”","At this he said to them: “Is he well?” They replied: “He is well. And here is his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep!”","Then he said: “It is still the middle of the day. It is not the time for gathering the herds. Water the sheep, and then go feed them.”","To this they said: “We are not allowed to do so until all the droves are gathered and they roll the stone away from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep.”","While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.","When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laʹban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laʹban, Jacob immediately approached and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Laʹban his mother’s brother.","Then Jacob kissed Rachel and raised his voice and burst into tears.","And Jacob began to tell Rachel that he was  the relative  of her father and that he was the son of Re·bekʹah. And she ran off and told her father.","As soon as Laʹban heard the report about Jacob the son of his sister, he ran to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him into his house. And he began to tell Laʹban all these things.","Laʹban said to him: “You are indeed my bone and my flesh.”  So he stayed with him a full month.","Laʹban then said to Jacob: “Just because you are my relative,  should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what are your wages to be?”","Now Laʹban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leʹah, and the name of the younger, Rachel.","But the eyes of Leʹah had no luster, whereas Rachel had become a very attractive and beautiful woman.","Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, so he said: “I am willing to serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”","To this Laʹban said: “It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man. Keep dwelling with me.”","And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but in his eyes they were like just a few days because of his love for her.","Then Jacob said to Laʹban: “Give over my wife because my days are up, and let me have relations with her.”","With that Laʹban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.","But during the evening, he resorted to taking his daughter Leʹah and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her.","Laʹban also gave his female servant Zilʹpah to his daughter Leʹah as a servant.","In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leʹah! So he said to Laʹban: “What have you done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why have you tricked me?”","To this Laʹban said: “It is not our custom here to give the younger woman before the firstborn.","Celebrate the week of this woman. After that you will also be given this other woman in exchange for serving me seven more years.”","Jacob did so and celebrated the week of this woman, after which he gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.","Besides, Laʹban gave his female servant Bilʹhah to his daughter Rachel as her servant.","Then Jacob had relations also with Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leʹah, and he served him for another seven years.","When Jehovah saw that Leʹah was unloved,  he then enabled her to become pregnant,  but Rachel was barren.","So Leʹah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him Reuʹben,  for she said: “It is because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction, for now my husband will begin to love me.”","And she again became pregnant and gave birth to a son and then said: “It is because Jehovah has listened, in that I was unloved, so he gave me this one also.” Then she named him Simʹe·on.","And she became pregnant yet again and gave birth to a son and then said: “Now this time my husband will join himself to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore, he was named Leʹvi.","And she became pregnant once more and gave birth to  a son and then said: “This time I will praise Jehovah.” She therefore named him Judah.  After that she stopped giving birth."],["When Rachel saw that she had borne no children to Jacob, she became jealous of her sister and began to say to Jacob: “Give me children or else I will die.”","At this Jacob’s anger flared up against Rachel, and he said: “Am I in the place of God, who has prevented you from having children?”","So she said: “Here is my slave girl Bilʹhah. Have relations with her in order that she may bear children for me  and that through her, I too may have children.”","With that she gave him her servant Bilʹhah as a wife, and Jacob had relations with her.","Bilʹhah became pregnant and in time bore Jacob a son.","Then Rachel said: “God has acted as my judge and has also listened to my voice, so that he gave me a son.” That is why she named him Dan.","Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, became pregnant once more and in time bore Jacob a second son.","Then Rachel said: “With strenuous wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. I have also come off the winner!” So she named him Naphʹta·li.","When Leʹah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilʹpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.","And Leʹah’s servant Zilʹpah bore a son to Jacob.","Then Leʹah said: “With good fortune!” So she named him Gad.","After that Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, bore a second son to Jacob.","Then Leʹah said: “With my happiness! For the daughters will certainly pronounce me happy.” So she named him Ashʹer.","Now Reuʹben was walking in the days of the wheat harvest, and he found mandrakes in the field. So he brought them to his mother Leʹah. Then Rachel said to Leʹah: “Give me, please, some of your son’s mandrakes.”","At this she said to her: “Is it a small matter that you took my husband? Would you now take my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said: “Very well. He will lie down with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”","When Jacob was coming from the field in the evening, Leʹah went out to meet him and said: “It is with me you are going to have relations, because I have hired you outright with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay down with her that night.","And God heard and answered Leʹah, and she became pregnant and in time bore to Jacob a fifth son.","Then Leʹah said: “God has given me my wages  because I have given my servant to my husband.” So she named him Isʹsa·char.","And Leʹah became pregnant once more and in time bore a sixth son to Jacob.","Then Leʹah said: “God has endowed me, yes, me, with a good endowment. At last, my husband will tolerate me, for I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebʹu·lun.","Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Diʹnah.","Finally God remembered Rachel, and God heard and  answered her by enabling her to become pregnant.","And she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said: “God has taken away my reproach!”","So she named him Joseph,  saying: “Jehovah is adding another son to me.”","After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob immediately said to Laʹban: “Send me away so that I may go to my place and to my land.","Give over my wives and my children, for whom I have served with you, that I may go, for you well know how I have served you.”","Then Laʹban said to him: “If I have found favor in your eyes,—I have understood by the omens  that Jehovah is blessing me because of you.”","And he added: “Stipulate your wages to me, and I will give them.”","So Jacob said to him: “You know how I have served you and how your herd has fared with me;","you had little before my coming, but your herd has increased and multiplied, and Jehovah has blessed you since I arrived. So when will I do something for my own house?”","Then he said: “What should I give you?” And Jacob said: “You will give me nothing whatsoever! If you will do this one thing for me, I will resume shepherding your flock and guarding it.","I will pass through your whole flock today. You set aside from there every sheep speckled and with color patches and every dark-brown sheep among the young rams and any color-patched and speckled one among the she-goats. From now on, these must become my wages.","And my righteousness  must speak for me on a future day when you come to look over my wages; every one that is not speckled and color-patched among the she-goats and dark brown among the young rams will be considered stolen if it is with me.”","To this Laʹban said: “That is fine! Let it be according to your word.”","Then on that day, he set aside the he-goats striped and color-patched and all the she-goats speckled and color-patched, every one in which there was any white and every one dark brown among the young rams, and gave them into the care of his sons.","After that he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was shepherding the flocks of Laʹban that remained over.","Jacob then took freshly cut staffs of the storax, almond, and plane trees, and he peeled white spots in them by exposing the white wood of the staffs.","Then he placed the staffs that he had peeled in front of the flock, in the gutters, in the drinking troughs, where the flocks would come to drink, that they might get into heat in front of them when they came to drink.","So the flocks would get into heat in front of the staffs, and the flocks would produce striped, speckled, and color-patched offspring.","Then Jacob separated the young rams and turned the flocks to face the striped ones and all the dark-brown ones among the flocks of Laʹban. Then he separated his own flocks and did not mix them with Laʹban’s flocks.","And whenever the robust animals would get into heat, Jacob would place the staffs in  the gutters before the eyes of the flocks, that they might get into heat by the staffs.","But when the animals were weak, he would not place the staffs there. So the weak ones always came to be Laʹban’s, but the robust ones became Jacob’s.","And the man grew very prosperous, and he acquired great flocks and male and female servants and camels and donkeys."],["In time he heard what the sons of Laʹban were saying: “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father, and from what belonged to our father, he has amassed all this wealth.”","When Jacob would look at the face of Laʹban, he saw that his attitude toward him was not what it used to be.","Finally Jehovah said to Jacob: “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will continue with you.”","Then Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leʹah to come out to the field to his flock,","and he said to them:","You yourselves certainly know that I have served your father with all my power.","And your father has tried to cheat me and has changed my wages ten times; but God has not allowed him to do me harm.","If on the one hand he would say, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced speckled ones; but if on the other hand he would say, ‘The striped ones will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped ones.","So God kept taking your father’s livestock away from him and giving it to me.","Once when the flock got into heat, I raised my eyes and saw in a dream that the he-goats mating with the flock were striped, speckled, and spotty.","Then the angel of the true God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ to which I said, ‘Here I am.’","And he continued, ‘Raise your eyes, please, and see that all the he-goats mating with the flock are striped, speckled, and spotty, for I have seen all that Laʹban is doing to you.","I am the true God of Bethʹel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now get up, go out of this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”","At this Rachel and Leʹah answered him: “Is there any share left for us to inherit in our father’s house?","Does he not consider us as foreigners, since he has sold us and has been using up the money given for us?","All the riches that God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. So, then, do everything that God has told you to do.”","Then Jacob got up and lifted his children and his wives on the camels,","and he began driving all his herd and all the goods that he had accumulated, the livestock in his possession that he had accumulated in Padʹdan-aʹram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Caʹnaan.","Now Laʹban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the teraphim statues  that belonged to her father.","Moreover, Jacob outwitted Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan, for he had not told him that he was running away.","And he ran away and crossed the River,  he and all he had. Then he headed toward the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad.","On the third day, Laʹban was  told that Jacob had run away.","So he took his brothers  with him and pursued him for a journey of seven days and caught up with him in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad.","Then God came to Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan in a dream by night and said to him: “Be careful about what you say to Jacob, either good or bad.”","So Laʹban approached Jacob, as Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and Laʹban had encamped with his brothers in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad.","Then Laʹban said to Jacob: “What have you done? Why have you resorted to outwitting me and carrying my daughters off like captives taken by the sword?","Why did you run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me? If you had told me, I could have sent you away with rejoicing and with songs, with tambourine and with harp.","But you did not give me a chance to kiss my grandchildren  and my daughters. You have acted foolishly.","It is in my power to do harm to you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful about what you say to Jacob, either good or bad.’","Now you have gone because you have been longing to return to the house of your father, but why have you stolen my gods?”","Jacob answered Laʹban: “It was because I was afraid, for I said to myself, ‘You might take your daughters away from me by force.’","Anyone with whom you find your gods will not live. Before our brothers, examine what I have, and take what is yours.” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.","So Laʹban went into the tent of Jacob and into the tent of Leʹah and into the tent of the two slave girls, but did not find them. Then he came out of Leʹah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent.","Meanwhile, Rachel had taken the teraphim statues and put them in the woman’s saddle basket of the camel, and she was sitting on them. So Laʹban searched through the whole tent but did not find them.","Then she said to her father: “Do not be angry, my lord, because I am not able to get up before you, for the customary thing with women is upon me.” So he searched on carefully but did not find the teraphim statues.","At that Jacob became angry and began to criticize Laʹban. Jacob then said to Laʹban: “What is my offense, and for what sin are you hotly pursuing me?","Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your house? Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between the two of us.","During these 20 years that I have been with you, your sheep and your goats never miscarried, and I never ate the rams of your flock.","I did not bring you any animal torn by wild beasts. I would stand the loss of it myself. Whether the animal was stolen by day or was stolen by night, you would demand compensation from me.","By day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and sleep would flee from my eyes.","This makes 20 years for me in your house. I have served you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times.","If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and  the One whom Isaac fears,  had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and that is why he reproved you last night.”","Then Laʹban answered Jacob: “The daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock, and everything you are looking at is mine and my daughters’. What can I do today against these or against their children whom they have borne?","Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and it will serve as a witness between us.”","So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.","Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!” And they took stones and made a pile. After that they ate there on the pile of stones.","And Laʹban began calling it Jeʹgar-sa·ha·duʹtha,  but Jacob called it Galʹe·ed.","Laʹban then said: “This pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.” That is why he named it Galʹe·ed,","and the Watchtower, for he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me when we are out of each other’s sight.","If you mistreat my daughters and if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters, though there is no man with us, remember that God will be a witness between you and me.”","Laʹban went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this pile of stones, and here is the pillar that I have erected between you and me.","This pile of stones is a witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me.","Let the God of Abraham and the God of Naʹhor, the God of their father, judge between us.” And Jacob swore by the One whom his father Isaac fears.","After that Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread. So they ate and spent the night in the mountain.","However, Laʹban got up early in the morning and kissed his grandchildren  and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laʹban departed and returned home."],["Jacob then went on his way, and the angels of God met up with him.","As soon as he saw them, Jacob said: “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Ma·ha·naʹim.","Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Eʹsau in the land of Seʹir, the territory  of Eʹdom,","and he commanded them: “This is what you will say to my lord, to Eʹsau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says: “I have resided  with Laʹban for a long time until now.","And I have acquired bulls, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants, and I send this message to inform my lord, in order to find favor in your eyes.”’”","In time the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: “We met your brother Eʹsau, and he is now on his way to meet you, and there are 400 men with him.”","And Jacob became very frightened and anxious. So he divided the people  who were with him, as well as the flocks, the cattle, and the camels, into two camps.","He said: “If Eʹsau attacks the one camp, then the other camp will be able to escape.”","After that Jacob said: “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you who are saying to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will deal well with you,’","I am unworthy of all the loyal love and of all the faithfulness that you have shown toward your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps.","Save me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother Eʹsau, for I am afraid of him that he may come and attack me, as well as the mothers and their children.","And you have said: ‘I will certainly deal well with you, and I will make your offspring  like the grains of sand of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”","And he spent the night there. Then he took some of his possessions as a gift for Eʹsau his brother:","200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 rams,","30 camels nursing their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 full-grown male donkeys.","He handed them over to his servants, one drove after another, and he said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and you are to set a space between one drove and the next.”","He also commanded the first one: “In case Eʹsau my brother should meet you and ask, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’","then you should say, ‘To your servant Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Eʹsau, and look! he himself is also behind us.’”","And he commanded also the second, the third, and all those following the droves: “According to this word, you are to speak to Eʹsau when you meet him.","And you should also say, ‘Here is your servant Jacob behind us.’” For he said to himself: ‘If I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me, then afterward when I see him, he may give me a kindly reception.’","So the gift crossed over ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.","Later during that night, he rose and took his two wives and his two female servants and his 11 young sons and crossed over the ford of Jabʹbok.","So he took them and brought them across the stream,  and he brought over everything else he had.","Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke.","When he saw that he had not prevailed over him, he touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him.","After that he said: “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you bless me.”","So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.”","Then he said: “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel,  for you have contended with God and with men and you have at last prevailed.”","In turn Jacob inquired: “Tell me, please, your name.” However, he said: “Why is it that you ask my name?” With that he blessed  him there.","So Jacob named the place Pe·niʹel,  for he said, “I have seen God face-to-face, yet my life  was preserved.”","And the sun rose upon him as soon as he passed by Pe·nuʹel,  but he was limping because of his hip.","That is why to this day the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the thigh sinew,  which is on the socket of the hip joint, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip joint by the thigh sinew."],["Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Eʹsau coming, and 400 men were with him. So he divided the children among Leʹah, Rachel, and the two female servants.","He put the female servants and their children in front, Leʹah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.","Then he himself went ahead of them and bowed down to the earth seven times as he came near to his brother.","But Eʹsau ran to meet him, and he embraced him and kissed him, and they burst into tears.","When he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children, he said: “Who are these with you?” to which he said: “The children with whom God has favored your servant.”","At that the female servants came forward with their children and bowed down,","and Leʹah too came forward with her children, and they bowed down. Then Joseph came forward with Rachel, and they bowed down.","Eʹsau said: “What is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met?” He replied: “In order to find favor in the eyes of my lord.”","Then Eʹsau said: “I have a great many possessions, my brother. Keep what is yours.”","However, Jacob said: “No, please. If I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, because I brought it so that I could see your face. And I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face, in that you received me with pleasure.","Take, please, the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you, for God has favored me and I have everything I need.” And he continued to urge him, so that he took it.","Later Eʹsau said: “Let us move out and go, and let me go in advance of you.”","But he said to him: “My lord is aware that the children are delicate and that in my care are sheep and cattle nursing their young. If they are driven too quickly for one day, then the whole flock will die.","Let my lord, please, go on ahead of his servant, but I will continue the journey more slowly at the pace of my livestock and of the children until I come to my lord at Seʹir.”","Then Eʹsau said: “Please, let me leave some of my people with you.” To this he said: “Why do this? Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”","So that day Eʹsau went on his way back to Seʹir.","And Jacob journeyed to Sucʹcoth, and he built a house for himself and he made shelters for his herd. That was why he named the place Sucʹcoth.","After journeying from Padʹdan-aʹram, Jacob arrived safely at the city of Sheʹchem in the land of Caʹnaan, and he set up his camp near the city.","Then he acquired a portion of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Haʹmor, the father of Sheʹchem, for 100  pieces of money.","There he set up an altar and called it God, the God of Israel."],["Now Diʹnah, Jacob’s daughter by Leʹah, used to go out to spend time with  the young women of the land.","When Sheʹchem, the son of Haʹmor the Hiʹvite, a chieftain of the land, saw her, he took her and lay down with her and violated her.","And he  became very attached to Diʹnah, the daughter of Jacob, and he fell in love with the young woman and spoke persuasively to her.","Finally Sheʹchem said to Haʹmor his father: “Get me this young woman to be my wife.”","When Jacob heard that he had defiled Diʹnah his daughter, his sons were with his herd in the field. So Jacob kept silent until they returned.","Later Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father, went out to speak with Jacob.","But the sons of Jacob heard about it and returned from the field right away. They were offended and very angry because he had disgraced Israel by lying down with Jacob’s daughter, something that should not be done.","Haʹmor spoke with them, saying: “My son Sheʹchem longs for  your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife,","and form marriage alliances  with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves.","You may dwell with us, and the land will become available for you. Dwell and carry on trade in it and settle in it.”","Then Sheʹchem said to her father and to her brothers: “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask me.","You can demand from me a very high bride price and gift. I am willing to give whatever you may say to me. Just give me the young woman as a wife.”","And Jacob’s sons answered Sheʹchem and Haʹmor his father deceitfully because he had defiled Diʹnah their sister.","They said to them: “We cannot possibly do such a thing, to give our sister to a man who is not circumcised,  for that is a disgrace to us.","We can only consent on this condition: that you become like us and circumcise all your males.","Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.","But if you do not listen to us and get circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”","Their words pleased Haʹmor and Sheʹchem, Haʹmor’s son.","The young man did not delay in doing what they asked, because he found delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father.","So Haʹmor and his son Sheʹchem went to the city gate and spoke to the men of their city, saying:","“These men wish to be at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and carry on trade in it, for the land is large enough to accommodate them. We can take their daughters as wives, and our daughters we can give to them.","Only on this one condition will the men consent to dwell with us in order to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised just the way they are circumcised.","Then, will not  their possessions, their wealth, and all their livestock be ours? So let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us.”","All those going out by the gate of his city listened to Haʹmor and to his son Sheʹchem, and all the males got circumcised, all those going out of the city gate.","However, on the third day, when they were still in pain, two sons of Jacob, Simʹe·on and Leʹvi, Diʹnah’s brothers, each took his sword and went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male.","They killed Haʹmor and his son Sheʹchem with the sword and then took Diʹnah from Sheʹchem’s house and left.","Jacob’s other sons came upon the slain men and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister.","They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.","They also took all their possessions, captured all their little children and their wives, and plundered everything in the houses.","At this Jacob said to Simʹe·on and to Leʹvi: “You have brought great trouble  on me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, to the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites. I am few in number, and they will certainly gather together to attack me and I will be annihilated, I and my house.”","But they said: “Should anyone treat our sister like a prostitute?”"],["After that God said to Jacob: “Rise, go up to Bethʹel and dwell there, and make an altar there to the true God, who appeared to you when you were running away from Eʹsau your brother.”","Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him: “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst, and cleanse yourselves and change your garments,","and let us rise and go up to Bethʹel. There I will make an altar to the true God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever  I have gone.”","So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried  them under the big tree that was close to Sheʹchem.","When they traveled on, the terror of God struck the cities around them, so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob.","Jacob eventually came to Luz, that is, Bethʹel, in the land of Caʹnaan, he and all the people with him.","There he built an altar and called the place El-bethʹel,  because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother.","Later Debʹo·rah, Re·bekʹah’s nurse, died and was buried at the foot of Bethʹel under an oak. So he named it Alʹlon-bacʹuth.","God appeared to Jacob once again while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram and blessed him.","God said to him: “Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel will be your name.” And he began to call him Israel.","God further said to him: “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and become many. Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you, and kings will descend from you.","As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will give it,  and to your offspring  after you I will give the land.”","Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.","So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.","And Jacob continued to call the place where God had spoken with him Bethʹel.","Then they pulled away from Bethʹel. And while they were still some distance from Ephʹrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was very difficult.","But while she was struggling to deliver the child, the midwife said to her: “Do not be afraid, for you will have this son also.”","Just as her life was slipping away  (for she was dying), she named him Ben-oʹni,  but his father called him Benjamin.","So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem.","Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.","After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of Eʹder.","Once while Israel was dwelling in that land, Reuʹben went and lay down with Bilʹhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.","The sons by Leʹah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuʹben, then Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun.","The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.","And the sons by Bilʹhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphʹta·li.","And the sons by Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s servant, were Gad and Ashʹer. These are Jacob’s sons, who were born to him in Padʹdan-aʹram.","Jacob eventually came to where his father Isaac was at Mamʹre, to Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, where Abraham and also Isaac had resided as foreigners.","Isaac lived to be 180 years old.","Then Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people,  after a long and satisfying life;  and his sons Eʹsau and Jacob buried him."],["This is the history of Eʹsau, that is, Eʹdom.","Eʹsau took his wives from the daughters of Caʹnaan: Aʹdah the daughter of Eʹlon the Hitʹtite; and O·hol·i·baʹmah the daughter of Aʹnah, the granddaughter of Zibʹe·on the Hiʹvite;","and Basʹe·math, Ishʹma·el’s daughter, the sister of Ne·baʹioth.","And Aʹdah bore Elʹi·phaz to Eʹsau, and Basʹe·math bore Reuʹel,","and O·hol·i·baʹmah bore Jeʹush, Jaʹlam, and Korʹah.","After that Eʹsau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the members  of his household, his herd and all his other beasts, and all the wealth he had accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan and he went to another land some distance away from Jacob his brother.","For their goods had become too many for them to dwell together, and the land where they were residing  was not able to sustain them because of their herds.","So Eʹsau took up  dwelling in the mountainous region of Seʹir.

This time the sun and the moon and 11 stars were bowing down to me.”","Then he related it to his father as well as his brothers, and his father rebuked him and said to him: “What is the meaning of this dream of yours? Am I as well as your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the earth to you?”","And his brothers grew jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.","His brothers now went to pasture their father’s flock near Sheʹchem.","Israel later said to Joseph: “Your brothers are tending flocks near Sheʹchem, are they not? Come, and let me send you to them.” At this he said to him: “I am ready!”","So he said to him: “Go, please, and see whether your brothers are well. See how the flock is, and bring word back to me.” With that  he sent him away from the valley  of Hebʹron, and he went on toward Sheʹchem.","Later a man found him as he was wandering in a field. The man asked him: “What are you looking for?”","To this he said: “I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me, where are they tending flocks?”","The man continued: “They have pulled away from here, for I heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Doʹthan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Doʹthan.","Now they caught sight of him from a distance, and before he reached them, they began plotting against him to put him to death.","So they said to one another: “Look! Here comes that dreamer.","Come, now, let us kill him and pitch him into one of the waterpits, and we will say that a vicious wild animal devoured him. Then let us see what will become of his dreams.”","When Reuʹben heard this, he tried to rescue him from them. So he said: “Let us not take his life.”","Reuʹben said to them: “Do not shed blood. Throw him into this waterpit in the wilderness, but do not harm  him.” His purpose was to rescue him from them in order to return him to his father.","So as soon as Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his robe, the special robe that he wore,","and they took him and threw him into the waterpit. At the time the pit was empty; there was no water in it.","Then they sat down to eat. When they looked up, there was a caravan of Ishʹma·el·ites coming from Gilʹe·ad. Their camels were carrying labdanum gum, balsam, and resinous bark, and they were on their way down to Egypt.","At this Judah said to his brothers: “What profit would there be if we killed our brother and covered over his blood?","Come, now, let us sell him to the Ishʹma·el·ites, and do not let our hand be upon him.

He  was in Achʹzib when she bore him.","In time Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Taʹmar.","But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was displeasing to Jehovah; so Jehovah put him to death.","In view of that, Judah said to Oʹnan: “Have relations with your brother’s wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her and raise up offspring for your brother.”","But Oʹnan knew that the offspring would not be considered his.

Judah kept the mourning period, and then he went to his sheepshearers in Timʹnah with his companion Hiʹrah the A·dulʹlam·ite.","Taʹmar was told: “Here your father-in-law is going up to Timʹnah to shear his sheep.”","With that she removed her widow’s clothing and veiled herself and covered herself with a shawl and sat down at the entrance of E·naʹim, which is on the road to Timʹnah, for she saw that Sheʹlah had grown up and yet she had not been given to him as a wife.","When Judah caught sight of her, he at once took her for a prostitute, because she had covered her face.","So he turned aside to her by the road and said: “Allow me, please, to have relations with you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. However, she said: “What will you give me that you may have relations with me?”","To this he said: “I will send a young goat from my herd.” But she said: “Will you give a security until you send it?”","He continued: “What security should I give you?” to which she said: “Your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand.” Then he gave them to her and had relations with her, and she became pregnant by him.","After that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself with her widow’s clothing.","And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the A·dulʹlam·ite, to get back the security from the hand of the woman, but he never found her.","He inquired of the men of her place, saying: “Where is that temple prostitute in E·naʹim along the road?” But they said: “No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.”","Finally he returned to Judah and said: “I never found her, and besides, the men of the place said, ‘No temple prostitute has ever been in this place.’”","So Judah said: “Let her take them for herself, in order that we may not fall into contempt. At any rate,  I have sent this young goat, but you never found her.”","However, about three months later, Judah was told: “Taʹmar your daughter-in-law has acted as a prostitute, and she is also pregnant by her prostitution.” At that Judah said: “Bring her out and let her be burned.”","As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong.” Then she added: “Please examine to whom these belong, the seal ring and the cord and the rod.”","Then Judah examined them and said: “She is more righteous than I am, because I did not give her to Sheʹlah my son.” And he had no further sexual relations with her after that.","When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb.","As she was giving birth, one put out his hand, and the midwife immediately took a scarlet thread and tied it around his hand, saying: “This one came out first.”","But as soon as he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she exclaimed: “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named Peʹrez.","Afterward his brother came out, around whose hand the scarlet thread was tied, and he was named Zeʹrah."],["Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and an Egyptian named Potʹi·phar, a court official of Pharʹaoh and chief of the guard, bought him from the Ishʹma·el·ites who had taken him down there.","But Jehovah was with Joseph.

Moreover, Joseph grew to be well-built and handsome.","Now after these things, the wife of his master began to cast her eyes on Joseph and say: “Lie down with me.”","But he refused and said to his master’s wife: “Here my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted everything he has into my care.","There is no one greater in this house than I am, and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you, because you are his wife. So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?”","So day after day she spoke to Joseph, but he never consented to lie with her or to remain with her.","But on one of the days when he went into the house to do his work, none of the household servants were in the house.","Then she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said: “Lie down with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled outside.","As soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,","she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them: “Look!

He came to me to lie down with me, but I began to cry out at the top of my voice.","Then as soon as he heard me raising my voice and screaming, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”","After that she laid his garment beside her until his master came to his house.","Then she told him the same thing, saying: “The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came to me to make me a laughingstock.","But as soon as I raised my voice and began to scream, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”","As soon as his master heard the words his wife spoke to him, saying: “These are the things your servant did to me,” his anger blazed.","So Joseph’s master took him and gave him over to the prison, the place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest, and he remained there in the prison.","But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.","So the chief officer of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners in the prison, and everything that they were doing there, he was the one having it done.","The chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph’s care, for Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful."],["After these things, the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker sinned against their lord, the king of Egypt.","So Pharʹaoh grew indignant at his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,","and he committed them to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard, to the place where Joseph was a prisoner.","Then the chief of the guard assigned Joseph to be with them and to take care of them, and they remained in jail for some time.","The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation.","The next morning, when Joseph came in and saw them, they looked dejected.","So he asked the officers of Pharʹaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house: “Why are your faces gloomy today?”","At this they said to him: “We each had a dream, but there is no interpreter with us.” Joseph said to them: “Do not interpretations belong to God? Relate it to me, please.”","So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, saying to him: “In my dream, there was a vine before me.","And on the vine, there were three twigs, and as it was sprouting shoots, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.","And Pharʹaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharʹaoh’s cup. After that I put the cup in Pharʹaoh’s hand.”","Then Joseph said to him: “This is its interpretation: The three twigs are three days.","Three days from now, Pharʹaoh will bring you out,  restoring you to your office, and you will put Pharʹaoh’s cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer.","Nevertheless, you must remember me  when things go well with you. Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharʹaoh, in order to get me out of this place.","I was, in fact, kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison.”","When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good, he said to him: “I too was in my dream, and there were three baskets of white bread on my head,","and in the top basket, there were all sorts of baked goods for Pharʹaoh, and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head.”","Then Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.","Three days from now, Pharʹaoh will behead you  and will hang you on a stake, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”","Now the third day was Pharʹaoh’s birthday, and he made a feast for all his servants, and he brought out  both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants.","And he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer, and he continued to hand the cup to Pharʹaoh.","But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.","However, the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he kept forgetting him."],["At the end of two full years, Pharʹaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River.","And there, coming up from the river, were seven fine-looking, fat cows, and they were feeding on the Nile grass.","There were seven other cows that looked ugly and thin coming up after them from the Nile, and they stood alongside the fat cows by the bank of the Nile.","Then the ugly, thin cows began to eat up the seven fine-looking, fat cows. At this Pharʹaoh woke up.","Then he went back to sleep and had a second dream. There were seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, full and choice.","And growing up after them were seven ears of grain that were thin and scorched by the east wind.","And the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven full and choice ears of grain. At this Pharʹaoh woke up and realized that it was a dream.","But in the morning, his spirit became agitated. So he sent for all the magic-practicing priests of Egypt and all her wise men. Pharʹaoh related his dreams to them, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharʹaoh.","At that the chief cupbearer spoke with Pharʹaoh, saying: “I am confessing my sins today.","Pharʹaoh was indignant at his servants. So he committed me to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard, both me and the chief baker.","After that we each had a dream on the same night. He and I each had a dream with its own interpretation.","And there with us was a young Hebrew man, a servant of the chief of the guard. When we related them to him, he interpreted for us the meaning of each dream.","It happened exactly as he had interpreted to us. I was restored to my office, but the other man was hanged.”","So Pharʹaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison.  He shaved and changed his clothes and went in to Pharʹaoh.","Then Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “I had a dream, but there is no one to interpret it. Now I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it.”","At this Joseph answered Pharʹaoh: “I need not be considered! God will speak concerning Pharʹaoh’s welfare.”","Pharʹaoh went on to say to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile River.","And there, coming up from the Nile, were seven fine-looking, fat cows, and they began to feed on the Nile grass.","And there were seven other cows coming up after them, poor and very bad-looking and thin. I have never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt.","And the skinny, bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows.","But when they had consumed them, no one could have known that they had done so, since their appearance was just as bad as at the start. At that I woke up.","“After that I saw in my dream seven ears of grain coming up on one stalk, full and choice.","Growing up after them were seven ears of shriveled grain, thin and scorched by the east wind.","Then the thin ears of grain began to swallow up the seven choice ears of grain. So I told it to the magic-practicing priests, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”","Then Joseph said to Pharʹaoh: “The dreams of Pharʹaoh are one and the same. The true God has told to Pharʹaoh what He will do.","The seven good cows are seven years. Likewise, the seven good ears of grain are seven years. The dreams are one and the same.","The seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, will prove to be seven years of famine.","This is just as I told to Pharʹaoh: The true God has caused Pharʹaoh to see what He will do.","“There are to be seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.","But seven years of famine will certainly arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten, and the famine will exhaust the land.","And the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine afterward, for it will be very severe.","The dream was given twice to Pharʹaoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true God, and the true God will soon carry it out.","“So now let Pharʹaoh look for a man who is discreet and wise and place him over the land of Egypt.","Let Pharʹaoh take action and appoint overseers in the land, and he should collect one fifth of the produce of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.","And let them collect all the food during these coming good years, and let them stockpile grain under Pharʹaoh’s authority as food to be stored in the cities and safeguarded there.","The food should serve as a supply for the land for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”","This proposal seemed good to Pharʹaoh and all his servants.","So Pharʹaoh said to his servants: “Can another man be found like this one in whom there is the spirit of God?”","Pharʹaoh then said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all of this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you.","You will personally be over  my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly. Only in my role as king  will I be greater than you.”","And Pharʹaoh added to Joseph: “See, I am putting you over all the land of Egypt.”","Then Pharʹaoh removed his signet ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph’s hand and clothed him with garments of fine linen and placed a necklace of gold around his neck.","Moreover, he had him ride in the second chariot of honor that he had, and they would call out ahead of him,  “A·vrékh!”  Thus he put him over all the land of Egypt.","Pharʹaoh further said to Joseph: “I am Pharʹaoh, but without your authorization, no man may do a single thing  in all the land of Egypt.”","After that Pharʹaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphʹe·nath-pa·neʹah and gave him Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On  as a wife. And Joseph began to oversee  the land of Egypt.","Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before  Pharʹaoh king of Egypt.","And during the seven years of abundance, the land went on producing plentifully.","And he kept collecting all the food of the seven years from the land of Egypt, and he would stockpile the food in the cities. In each city he would store the food from the fields around it.","Joseph continued stockpiling grain in very great quantity, like the sand of the sea, until finally they gave up measuring it because it could not be measured.","Before the year of the famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On  bore to him.","Joseph named the firstborn Ma·nasʹseh,  for he said, “God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.”","And he named the second one Eʹphra·im,  for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”","Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt ended,","and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. The famine developed in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.","Eventually, all the land of Egypt suffered from the famine, and the people began to cry to Pharʹaoh for bread. Then Pharʹaoh said to all the Egyptians: “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.”","The famine continued over all the surface of the earth. Then Joseph began to open up all the granaries that were among them and to sell to the Egyptians, as the famine had a strong grip on the land of Egypt.","Moreover, people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy from Joseph, because the famine had a strong grip on all the earth."],["When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons: “Why do you just keep looking at one another?”","He added: “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may stay alive and  not die.”","So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.","But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his other brothers, for he said: “Perhaps a fatal accident may befall him.”","So Israel’s sons came along with the others who were coming to buy, because the famine had extended to the land of Caʹnaan.","Joseph was the man in authority over the land, and he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the earth. So Joseph’s brothers came and bowed low to him with their faces to the ground.","When Joseph saw his brothers, he immediately recognized them, but he concealed his identity from them. So he spoke harshly with them and said: “Where have you come from?” to which they said: “From the land of Caʹnaan to buy food.”","Thus Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.","Joseph immediately remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them: “You are spies! You have come to see the vulnerable areas  of the land!”","Then they said to him: “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.","We are all sons of but one man. We are upright men. Your servants do not act as spies.”","But he said to them: “Not so! You have come to see the vulnerable areas of the land!”","At this they said: “Your servants are 12 brothers. We are the sons of but one man in the land of Caʹnaan, and the youngest is now with our father, whereas the other one is no more.”","However, Joseph said to them: “It is just as I said to you—‘You are spies!’","By this you will be tested: As surely as Pharʹaoh lives, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here.","Send one of you to bring your brother while you remain in bondage. In this way, your words may be tested out to see if you are telling the truth. And if not, then, as surely as Pharʹaoh lives, you are spies.”","With that he put them together in custody for three days.","Joseph said to them on the third day: “Do this and live, for I fear God.","If you are upright, let one of your brothers remain in bondage in your house of custody, but the rest of you may go and take grain to alleviate the famine in your households.","Then bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words will be found trustworthy and you will not die.” And they did so.","And they said to one another: “We are surely being punished on account of our brother, because we saw his distress  when he begged us to show compassion, but we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”","Then Reuʹben answered them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not sin against the child,’ but you would not listen? Now his blood is certainly being asked back.”","But they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.","So he turned away from them and began to weep. When he returned and spoke to them again, he took Simʹe·on from them and bound him before their eyes.","Joseph then gave the command to fill up their bags  with grain and to return each man’s money to his own sack and to give them  provisions for the journey. This was done for them.","So they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left from there.","When one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, he saw his money there in the mouth of his bag.","At that he said to his brothers: “My money has been returned, and now here it is in my bag!” Then their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said: “What is this that God has done to us?”","When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Caʹnaan, they told him all the things that had befallen them, saying:","“The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly with us and accused us of spying on the country.","But we said to him, ‘We are upright men. We are not spies.","We are 12 brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Caʹnaan.’","But the man who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are upright: Leave one of your brothers with me. Then take something to alleviate the famine in your households and go.","And bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may know that you are not spies but upright men. I will then give your brother back to you, and you may carry on trade in the land.’”","As they were emptying their sacks, here was each one’s bag of money in his sack. When they and their father saw their bags of money, they became afraid.","Jacob their father exclaimed to them: “It is I you have bereaved! Joseph is no more, and Simʹe·on is no more, and you are going to take Benjamin! It is upon me that all these things have come!”","But Reuʹben said to his father: “You may put to death my own two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Give him over to my care, and I will return him to you.”","However, he said: “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is dead and he alone is left. If a fatal accident should befall him on the journey you would make, then you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the Grave  in grief.”"],["Now the famine was severe in the land.","So when they had finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them: “Return and buy a little food for us.”","Then Judah said to him: “The man clearly warned us, ‘You must not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’","If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.","But if you do not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You must not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’”","And Israel asked: “Why did you have to bring this trouble on me by telling the man that you had another brother?”","They replied: “The man directly inquired concerning us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ and we told him these facts. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”","Judah then urged Israel his father: “Send the boy with me, and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die—we and you and our children.","I will be a guarantee for his safety.   You may hold me responsible. If I fail to return him to you and present him to you, I will have sinned against you for all time.","But if we had not delayed, we could have been there and back twice by now.”","So Israel their father said to them: “If it must be so, then do this: Take the finest products of the land in your bags  and carry them down to the man as a gift: a little balsam, a little honey, labdanum, resinous bark, pistachio nuts, and almonds.","Take double the money with you; and also take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your bags. Maybe it was a mistake.","Take your brother and go, return to the man.","May God Almighty grant you pity from the man, so that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. But as for me, if I must be bereaved, I will be bereaved!”","So the men took this gift, and they took double the money in their hand and Benjamin. Then they rose and went on their way down to Egypt and again stood before Joseph.","When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he at once said to the man who was over his house: “Take the men to the house and slaughter animals and prepare the meal, for the men are to eat with me at noon.”","Immediately the man did just as Joseph had said, and he took them to Joseph’s house.","But the men became afraid when they were taken to Joseph’s house, and they began to say: “It is because of the money that was returned in our bags the last time that we are being brought here. Now they will attack us and make us slaves and take our donkeys!”","So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.","They said: “Pardon us, my lord! We did come down the first time to buy food.","But when we arrived at our lodging place and began opening our bags, why, here was the money of each one in the mouth of his bag, our money in full weight. So we would like to return it personally.","And we have brought more money to buy food. We do not know who placed our money in our bags.”","Then he said: “It is all right. Do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father put treasure in your bags. Your money came first to me.” After that he brought out Simʹe·on to them.","Then the man brought them into Joseph’s house and gave them water for washing their feet, and he gave fodder for their donkeys.","And they prepared the gift for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they had heard that they were going to eat a meal there.","When Joseph went into the house, they brought their gift to him into the house and prostrated themselves to him to the ground.","After this he inquired about their welfare and said: “How is your aged father of whom you have spoken? Is he still alive?”","To this they said: “Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.” Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.","When he looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, he said: “Is this your brother, the youngest one of whom you have spoken to me?” He added: “May God show you his favor, my son.”","Joseph then hurried out, because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he looked for a place to weep. So he went  into a private room and gave way to tears there.","After that he washed his face and went out, now in control of himself, and he said: “Serve the meal.”","They served him by himself and them by themselves, and the Egyptians with him ate by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, because that is a detestable thing to the Egyptians.","The brothers  were seated before him, the firstborn according to his right as firstborn and the youngest according to his youth, and they kept looking at one another in amazement.","He kept sending portions of food from his table to theirs, but he increased Benjamin’s portion five times the size of the portions of all the others. So they continued banqueting and drinking with him to the full."],["Later he commanded the man who was over his house: “Fill the bags of the men with as much food as they can carry, and place the money of each one in the mouth of his bag.","But you must place my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the bag of the youngest, along with the money for his grain.” So he did as Joseph had instructed.","In the morning when it had become light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.","They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to the man who was over his house: “Get up! Chase after the men! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid bad for good?","Is not this what my master drinks from and uses to read omens expertly? It is a wicked thing you have done.’”","So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.","But they said to him: “Why does my lord say such a thing? It is unthinkable that your servants would do anything like this.","Why, the money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of Caʹnaan. How, then, could we steal silver or gold from the house of your master?","If it is found with one of your slaves, let him die, and the rest of us will also become slaves to my master.”","So he said: “Let it be as you say: The one with whom it is found will become my slave, but the rest of you will be innocent.”","With that each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it.","He searched carefully, starting with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. Finally the cup was found in Benjamin’s bag.","Then they ripped their garments apart, and each of them lifted his load back onto his donkey and returned to the city.","When Judah and his brothers went into Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.","Joseph said to them: “What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man like me can expertly read omens?”","At this Judah replied: “What can we say to my master? What can we speak? And how can we prove ourselves righteous? The true God has found out the error of your slaves. We are now slaves to my master, both we and the one in whose hand the cup was found!”","However, he said: “It is unthinkable for me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found is the one who will become a slave to me. As for the rest of you, go up in peace to your father.”","Judah now approached him and said: “I beg you, my master, please let your slave speak a word in my master’s ears, and do not become angry with your slave, for you are like Pharʹaoh himself.","My master asked his slaves, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’","So we said to my master, ‘We do have an aged father and a child of his old age, the youngest. But his brother is dead, so he is the only remaining son of his mother, and his father loves him.’","After that you said to your slaves, ‘Bring him down to me so that I may see him.’","But we said to my master, ‘The boy is not able to leave his father. If he did leave him, his father would certainly die.’","Then you said to your slaves, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you may not see my face anymore.’","“So we went up to your slave my father and told him the words of my master.","Later our father said, ‘Return and buy a little food for us.’","But we said, ‘We are not able to go down. If our youngest brother is with us we will go down, for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’","Then your slave my father said to us, ‘You well know that my wife bore but two sons to me.","But one of them left me and I said: “He must surely have been torn to pieces!” and I have not seen him until now.","If you were to take this one also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him, you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the Grave  with calamity.’","“And now if I return to your slave my father without the boy along with us, since his own life  is bound up with this one’s life,","then as soon as he sees that the boy is not there, he will die, and your slaves will indeed bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father to the Grave  in grief.","Your slave gave a guarantee to my father for the boy, saying, ‘If I fail to bring him back to you, then I will have sinned against my father forever.’","So now, please, let your slave stay instead of the boy as my master’s slave, in order that the boy may return with his brothers.","How can I return to my father without the boy along with me? I could not bear looking on when this calamity befalls my father!”"],["At this Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants. So he cried out: “Have everyone leave me!” No one else stayed with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.","Then he began to weep so loudly that the Egyptians heard it and Pharʹaoh’s house heard it.","Finally Joseph said to his brothers: “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were unable to answer him at all, because they were astonished on account of him.","So Joseph said to his brothers: “Come close to me, please.” With that they came close to him.","But now do not be upset and do not reproach one another because you sold me here; because God has sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life.","This is the second year of the famine in the land, and there are yet five years in which there will be no plowing or harvest.","But God sent  me ahead of you in order to preserve for you a remnant on the earth  and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.","So, then, it was not you who sent me here, but it was the true God, in order to appoint me as chief adviser  to Pharʹaoh and lord for all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.","“Return quickly to my father, and you must say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph has said: “God has appointed me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not delay.","You must dwell in the land of Goʹshen, where you will be near me—you, your sons, your grandsons, your flocks, your herds, and everything you have.","I will supply you with food there, for there are yet five years of famine. Otherwise, you and your house and everything you have will come to poverty.”’","You and my brother Benjamin can now see with your own eyes that I am really the one speaking to you.","So you must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and everything you have seen. Now hurry and bring my father down here.”","Then he embraced  his brother Benjamin and gave way to weeping, and Benjamin wept with his arms around his neck.","And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers spoke with him.","The news reached the house of Pharʹaoh: “Joseph’s brothers have come!” It was good in the eyes of Pharʹaoh and his servants.","So Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your beasts of burden and go to the land of Caʹnaan,","and take your father and your households and come here to me. I will give you the good things of the land of Egypt, and you will eat  the richest  part of the land.’","And you are commanded to tell them: ‘Do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your children and your wives, and you must bring your father on one of them and come here.","Do not worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”","And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharʹaoh’s orders, and he gave them provisions for the journey.","To each of them he gave individual changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave 300 silver pieces and five changes of clothing.","And to his father he sent the following: ten donkeys carrying good things of Egypt and ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread and sustenance for his father for the journey.","So he sent his brothers off, and as they departed, he said to them: “Do not become upset with one another on the way.”","Then they went up from Egypt and came into the land of Caʹnaan to their father Jacob.","Then they reported to him: “Joseph is still alive, and he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt!” But his heart grew numb because he did not believe them.","When they went on telling him all the words that Joseph had spoken to them and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob began to revive.","Israel exclaimed: “It is enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die!”"],["So Israel took all that he had  and departed. When he arrived at Beʹer-sheʹba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.","Then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said: “Jacob, Jacob!” to which he said: “Here I am!”","He said: “I am the true God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.","I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there, and Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes.”","After that Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba, and the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharʹaoh had sent to transport him.","They took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan. And so they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him.","He brought with him into Egypt his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters—all his offspring.","Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn was Reuʹben.","The sons of Reuʹben were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi.","The sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman.","The sons of Leʹvi were Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi.","The sons of Judah were Er, Oʹnan, Sheʹlah, Peʹrez, and Zeʹrah. However, Er and Oʹnan died in the land of Caʹnaan.","The sons of Isʹsa·char were Toʹla, Puʹvah, Iob, and Shimʹron.","The sons of Zebʹu·lun were Seʹred, Eʹlon, and Jahʹle·el.","These are the sons of Leʹah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padʹdan-aʹram, together with his daughter Diʹnah. All his sons and his daughters  numbered 33.","The sons of Gad were Ziphʹi·on, Hagʹgi, Shuʹni, Ezʹbon, Eʹri, Ar·oʹdi, and A·reʹli.","The sons of Ashʹer were Imʹnah, Ishʹvah, Ishʹvi, and Be·riʹah, and their sister was Seʹrah.","These are the sons of Zilʹpah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. She bore these to Jacob: 16 persons  in all.","The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.","There were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im, whom Asʹe·nath the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On  bore to him.","The sons of Benjamin were Beʹla, Beʹcher, Ashʹbel, Geʹra, Naʹa·man, Eʹhi, Rosh, Mupʹpim, Hupʹpim, and Ard.","These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: 14 persons  in all.","The son  of Dan was Huʹshim.","The sons of Naphʹta·li were Jahʹze·el, Guʹni, Jeʹzer, and Shilʹlem.","These are the sons of Bilʹhah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob: seven persons  in all.","All those  who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66.","Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two.  All the people  of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were 70.","Jacob sent Judah ahead to tell Joseph that he was on the way to Goʹshen. When they came into the land of Goʹshen,","Joseph had his chariot prepared and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. When he presented himself to him, he at once embraced him  and wept for some time.","Then Israel said to Joseph: “Now I am ready to die; I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”","Joseph then said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh and tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan have come here to me.","The men are shepherds, and they raise livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’","When Pharʹaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’","you must say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’ so that you may dwell in the land of Goʹshen, for every herder of sheep is detestable to the Egyptians.”"],["So Joseph went and reported to Pharʹaoh: “My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they possess have come from the land of Caʹnaan, and they are in the land of Goʹshen.”","He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharʹaoh.","Pharʹaoh said to his brothers: “What is your occupation?” They replied to Pharʹaoh: “Your servants are herders of sheep, both we and our forefathers.”","Then they said to Pharʹaoh: “We have come to reside as foreigners in the land because there are no pastures for the flock of your servants, for the famine is severe in the land of Caʹnaan. So please let your servants dwell in the land of Goʹshen.”","At that Pharʹaoh said to Joseph: “Your father and your brothers have come here to you.","The land of Egypt is at your disposal. Have your father and your brothers dwell in the very best part of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goʹshen, and if you know of any capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”","Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and presented him to Pharʹaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharʹaoh.","Pharʹaoh asked Jacob: “How old are you?”","Jacob said to Pharʹaoh: “The years of my wanderings  are 130. Few and distressing the years of my life have been, and they are not as long as the years of the lives of my forefathers during their wanderings.”","After that Jacob blessed Pharʹaoh and went out from before him.","So Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them a possession in the  land of Egypt, in the very best part of the land, in the land of Ramʹe·ses, just as Pharʹaoh had commanded.","And Joseph kept supplying his father and his brothers and the entire household of his father with food  according to the number of their children.","Now there was no food  in all the land, because the famine was very severe, and the land of Egypt and the land of Caʹnaan became exhausted as a result of the famine.","Joseph was collecting all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Caʹnaan for the grain that people were buying, and Joseph kept bringing the money into Pharʹaoh’s house.","In time the money from the land of Egypt and the land of Caʹnaan was spent, and all the Egyptians began coming to Joseph, saying: “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out?”","Then Joseph said: “If your money has run out, hand over your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.”","So they began bringing their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph kept giving them food in exchange for their horses, the livestock of the flock and of the herd, and the donkeys, and he kept providing them with food in exchange for all their livestock during that year.","When that year came to its close, they began coming to him the next year and saying: “We will not hide from my lord that the money and the stock of domestic animals have already been given to my lord. We have nothing left for my lord but our bodies and our land.","Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we together with our land will become slaves to Pharʹaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die and that our land may not become desolate.”","Joseph then bought all the land of the Egyptians for Pharʹaoh because every Egyptian sold his field, for the famine was very severe; and the land became Pharʹaoh’s.","Then he moved the people into cities, from one end of the territory of Egypt to its other end.","Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because the rations for the priests were from Pharʹaoh and they lived on their rations that Pharʹaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.","Then Joseph said to the people: “See, I have today bought you and your land for Pharʹaoh. Here is seed for you, and you must sow the land with it.","When it produces, give a fifth to Pharʹaoh, but four parts will be yours as seed for the field and as food for you and for those in your houses and for your children to eat.”","So they said: “You have preserved our lives. Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will become slaves to Pharʹaoh.”","Then Joseph made it a decree, which is valid until today over the land of Egypt, that a fifth belongs to Pharʹaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharʹaoh’s.","Israel continued to dwell in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goʹshen, and they settled in it and were fruitful and increased greatly.","And Jacob lived on in the land of Egypt for 17 years, so that the days of Jacob’s life came to be 147 years.","The time was approaching for Israel to die, so he called his son Joseph and said: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, place your hand, please,  under my thigh, and show loyal love and faithfulness to me. Please, do not bury me in Egypt.","When I die,  you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in the grave of my forefathers.” Accordingly, he said: “I will do just as you say.”","Then he said: “Swear to me.” So he swore to him. At that Israel bowed down at the head of his bed."],["After these things, Joseph was told: “Look, your father is getting weak.” At that he took his two sons Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im with him.","Then Jacob was told: “Here your son Joseph has come to you.” So Israel gathered his strength and sat up on his bed.","And Jacob said to Joseph:","And he said to me, ‘I am making you fruitful, and I will make you many, and I will transform you into a congregation of peoples, and I will give this land to your offspring  after you as a lasting possession.’","Now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are mine. Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh will become mine just as Reuʹben and Simʹe·on are mine.","But the children born to you after them will become yours. They will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.","As for me, when I was coming from Padʹdan, Rachel died alongside me in the land of Caʹnaan, while there was yet a good stretch of land before coming to Ephʹrath. So I buried her there on the way to Ephʹrath, that is, Bethʹle·hem.”","Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and asked: “Who are these?”","So Joseph said to his father: “They are my sons whom God has given me in this place.” At this he said: “Bring them to me, please, so that I may bless them.”","Now the eyes of Israel were failing from age, and he was unable to see. So Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.","Israel said to Joseph: “I never imagined I would see your face, but here God has also let me see your offspring.”","Joseph then removed them from Israel’s knees, and he bowed down with his face to the ground.","Joseph now took the two of them, Eʹphra·im with his right hand to Israel’s left and Ma·nasʹseh with his left hand to Israel’s right, and brought them close to him.","However, Israel put out his right hand and placed it on Eʹphra·im’s head, although he was the younger, and he placed his left hand on Ma·nasʹseh’s head. He purposely laid his hands this way, since Ma·nasʹseh was the firstborn.","Then he blessed Joseph and said:","The angel who has been recovering me from all calamity, bless the boys.","When Joseph saw that his father kept his right hand placed on Eʹphra·im’s head, it was displeasing to him, so he tried to take hold of his father’s hand to move it from Eʹphra·im’s head to Ma·nasʹseh’s head.","Joseph said to his father: “Not  so, my father, because this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”","But his father kept refusing and said: “I know it, my son, I know it. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will become greater than he will, and his offspring  will become the full equivalent of nations.”","So he continued to bless them on that day, saying:","Then Israel said to Joseph: “Look, I am dying, but God will certainly continue with you and return you to the land of your forefathers.","As for me, I do give you one portion of land  more than to your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amʹor·ites with my sword and my bow.”"],["And Jacob called his sons and said: “Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days.","Assemble yourselves and listen, you sons of Jacob, yes, listen to Israel your father.","“Reuʹben, you are my firstborn, my vigor and the beginning of my procreative power, the excellence of dignity and the excellence of strength.","With recklessness like turbulent waters, you will not excel, because you have gone up to your father’s bed. At that time you defiled  my bed. He actually went on to it!","“Simʹe·on and Leʹvi are brothers. Instruments of violence are their slaughter weapons.","Into their company do not come, O my soul.  With their assembly do not join, O my honor,  because in their anger they killed men, and for their pleasure they hamstrung bulls.","Cursed be their anger, because it is cruel, and their fury, because it is harsh. Let me disperse them in Jacob, and let me scatter them in Israel.","“As for you, Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. The sons of your father will bow down before you.","Judah is a lion cub. From the prey, my son, you will certainly go up. He has crouched down and stretched himself out like a lion, and like a lion, who dares rouse him?","The scepter will not depart from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiʹloh  comes, and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong.","Tying his donkey to a vine and his donkey’s colt to a choice vine, he will wash his clothing in wine and his garment in the blood of grapes.","Dark red are his eyes from wine, and his teeth are white from milk.","“Zebʹu·lun will reside by the seashore, by the shore where the ships lie anchored, and his remote border will be toward Siʹdon.","“Isʹsa·char is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between the two saddlebags.","And he will see that the resting-place is good and that the land is pleasant. He will bend his shoulder to bear the burden and will submit to forced labor.","“Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.","Let Dan be a serpent by the roadside, a horned snake beside the path, that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward.","I will wait for salvation from you, O Jehovah.","“As for Gad, a marauder band will raid him, but he will raid at their heels.","“Ashʹer’s bread  will be abundant,  and he will provide food fit for a king.","“Naphʹta·li is a slender doe. He is speaking words of elegance.","“Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree, a fruitful tree by a spring, whose branches extend over the wall.","But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him.","And yet his bow remained in place, and his hands stayed strong and agile. This was from the hands of the powerful one of Jacob, from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.","He  is from the God of your father, and he will help you, and he is with the Almighty, and he will bless you with the blessings of the heavens above, with the blessings of the deep below, with the blessings of the breasts and womb.","The blessings of your father will be superior to the blessings of the eternal mountains, to the desirable things of the enduring hills. They will continue upon the head of Joseph, upon the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers.","“Benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf. In the morning he will eat the prey, and in the evening he will divide spoil.”","All of these are the 12 tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he was blessing them. He gave each of them an appropriate blessing.","After that he gave these commands to them: “I am being gathered to my people.  Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Eʹphron the Hitʹtite,","the cave in the field of Mach·peʹlah in front of Mamʹre in the land of Caʹnaan, the field that Abraham purchased from Eʹphron the Hitʹtite as a property for a burial place.","There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. There they buried Isaac and his wife Re·bekʹah, and there I buried Leʹah.","The field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the sons of Heth.”","Thus Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons. Then he drew his feet up onto the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people."],["Joseph then threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.","After that Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel,","and they took the full 40 days for him, for this is the full period for the embalming, and the Egyptians continued to shed tears for him 70 days.","When the days of mourning for him passed, Joseph spoke to Pharʹaoh’s court,  saying: “If I have found favor in your eyes, give this message to Pharʹaoh:","‘My father made me swear, saying: “Look! I am dying. You are to bury me in my burial place, which I have excavated in the land of Caʹnaan.” Please, let me go up and bury  my father, after which I will return.’”","Pharʹaoh replied: “Go and bury your father just as he made you swear.”","So Joseph went up to bury his father, and all of Pharʹaoh’s servants went with him, the elders of his court and all the elders of the land of Egypt","and all of Joseph’s household and his brothers and the household of his father. Only their little children and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of Goʹshen.","Chariots and horsemen also went up with him, and the camp was very numerous.","Then they came to the threshing floor of Aʹtad, which is in the region of the Jordan, and there they carried on a very great and bitter mourning, and he kept mourning for his father seven days.","The inhabitants of the land, the Caʹnaan·ites, saw them mourning at the threshing floor of Aʹtad, and they exclaimed: “This is a great mourning for the Egyptians!” That is why it was named Aʹbel-mizʹra·im,  which is in the region of the Jordan.","So his sons did for him exactly as he had instructed them.","His sons carried him into the land of Caʹnaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach·peʹlah, the field in front of Mamʹre that Abraham had purchased from Eʹphron the Hitʹtite as property for a burial place.","After he buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all those who had gone with him to bury his father.","When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said: “It may be that Joseph is harboring animosity against us and that he will repay us for all the evil that we did to him.”","So they sent a message to Joseph in these words: “Your father gave this command before his death:","‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: “I beg you, please pardon the transgression of your brothers and the sin they committed in bringing such harm to you.”’ Now, please, pardon the transgression of the servants of your father’s God.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.","Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said: “Here we are as slaves to you!”","Joseph said to them: “Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God?","Although you meant to harm me, God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive, as he is doing today.","So now do not be afraid. I will keep supplying you and your little children with food.” Thus he comforted them and spoke reassuringly to them.","And Joseph continued to dwell in Egypt, he and the household of his father, and Joseph lived for 110 years.","Joseph saw the third generation of Eʹphra·im’s sons, also the sons of Maʹchir, Ma·nasʹseh’s son. They were born upon Joseph’s knees.","At length Joseph said to his brothers: “I am dying, but God will without fail turn his attention to you, and he will certainly bring you up out of this land to the land about which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”","So Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying: “God will without fail turn his attention to you. You must take my bones up out of here.”","And Joseph died at the age of 110, and they had him embalmed, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."]],"Exodus":[["Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt with Jacob, each man who came with his household:","Reuʹben, Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, and Judah;","Isʹsa·char, Zebʹu·lun, and Benjamin;","Dan and Naphʹta·li; Gad and Ashʹer.","And all those  who were born to Jacob  were 70 people,  but Joseph was already  in Egypt.","Joseph eventually died, and also all his brothers and all that generation.","And the Israelites  became fruitful and began to increase greatly, and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at an extraordinary rate, so that the land became filled with them.","In time there arose over Egypt a new king, one who did not know Joseph.","So he said to his people: “Look! The people of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we are.","Let us deal shrewdly with them. Otherwise, they will continue to multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us and leave the country.”","So they appointed chiefs of forced labor  over them to oppress them with hard labor, and they built storage cities for Pharʹaoh, namely, Piʹthom and Ra·amʹses.","But the more they would oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading out, so they felt sick with fear because of the Israelites.","Consequently, the Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh slavery.","They made their life bitter with hard labor, as they worked with clay mortar and bricks and in every form of slavery in the field. Yes, they made them toil in harsh conditions in every form of slavery.","Later the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives whose names were Shiphʹrah and Puʹah,","and he told them: “When you help the Hebrew women to give birth and you see them on the stool for childbirth,  you must put the child to death if it is a son; but if it is a daughter, she must live.”","However, the midwives feared the true God, and they did not do what the king of Egypt told them. Instead, they would keep the male children alive.","In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them: “Why have you kept the male children alive?”","The midwives said to Pharʹaoh: “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. They are lively and have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.”","So God dealt well with the midwives, and the people kept increasing and becoming very mighty.","And because the midwives had feared the true God, he later gave them families.","Finally Pharʹaoh commanded all his people: “You are to throw every newborn son of the Hebrews into the Nile River, but you are to keep every daughter alive.”"],["About that time, a certain man of the house of Leʹvi married a daughter of Leʹvi.","And the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw how beautiful he was, she kept him concealed for three months.","When she was no longer able to conceal him, she took a papyrus basket  and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile River.","But his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.","When Pharʹaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the Nile, her female attendants were walking by the side of the Nile. And she caught sight of the basket in the middle of the reeds. She immediately sent her slave girl to get it.","When she  opened it, she saw the child, and the boy was crying. She felt compassion for him, but she said: “This is one of the children of the Hebrews.”","Then his sister said to Pharʹaoh’s daughter: “Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?”","Pharʹaoh’s daughter said to her: “Go!” At once the girl went and called the child’s mother.","Pharʹaoh’s daughter then said to her: “Take this child with you and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.","When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharʹaoh’s daughter, and he became a son to her. She named him Moses  and said: “It is because I have drawn him out of the water.”","Now in those days, after Moses had become an adult,  he went out to his brothers to look at the burdens they were bearing, and he caught sight of an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brothers.","So he looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.","But he went out on the following day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting with each other. So he said to the one in the wrong: “Why do you strike your companion?”","At this he said: “Who appointed you as a prince and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me just as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses now was afraid and said: “Surely the matter has become known!”","Then Pharʹaoh heard about it, and he attempted to kill Moses; but Moses ran away from Pharʹaoh and went to dwell in the land of Midʹi·an, and he sat down by a well.","Now the priest of Midʹi·an had seven daughters, and these came to draw water and to fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.","But as usual, the shepherds came and drove them away. At this Moses got up and helped  the women and watered their flock.","When they came home to their father Reuʹel,  he exclaimed: “How is it that you have come home so quickly today?”","They replied: “A certain Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.”","He said to his daughters: “But where is he? Why did you leave the man behind? Call him, so that he may eat with us.”","After that Moses consented to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zip·poʹrah to Moses in marriage.","Later she bore a son, and he named him Gerʹshom,  for he said, “I have become a foreign resident in a foreign land.”","After a long time,  the king of Egypt died, but the Israelites continued to groan because of the slavery and to cry out in complaint, and their cry for help because of the slavery kept going up to the true God.","In time God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","So God looked on the Israelites; and God took notice."],["Moses became a shepherd of the flock of his father-in-law Jethʹro, the priest of Midʹi·an. While he was leading the flock to the west side of the wilderness, he eventually came to the mountain of the true God, to  Horʹeb.","Then Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, he saw that the thornbush was on fire, and yet the thornbush was not consumed.","So Moses said: “I will go over to inspect this unusual sight to see why the thornbush does not burn up.”","When Jehovah saw that he went over to look, God called to him out of the thornbush and said: “Moses! Moses!” to which he said: “Here I am.”","Then he said: “Do not come any nearer. Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground.”","He went on to say: “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at the true God.","Jehovah added: “I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry because of those who force them to work; I well know the pains they suffer.","I will go down to rescue them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites.","Now look! The outcry of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen also the harsh way that the Egyptians are oppressing them.","Now come, I will send you to Pharʹaoh, and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”","However, Moses said to the true God: “Who am I that I should go to Pharʹaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”","To this he said: “I will prove to be with you, and this is the sign for you that it was I who sent you: After you have brought the people out of Egypt, you people will serve  the true God on this mountain.”","But Moses said to the true God: “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your forefathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I say to them?”","So God said to Moses: “I Will Become What I Choose  to Become.”  And he added: “This is what you are to say to the Israelites, ‘I Will Become has sent me to you.’”","Then God said once more to Moses:","Now go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Jehovah the God of your forefathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he said: “I have certainly taken notice of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt.","So I say, I will take you away from affliction at the hands of the Egyptians to the land of the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’","“They will certainly listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you men should say to him: ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. So,  please, let us make a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.’","But I myself well know that the king of Egypt will not give you permission to go unless a mighty hand compels him.","So I will have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my extraordinary acts that I will do in it, and after that he will send you out.","And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and when you go, you will by no means go empty-handed.","Each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman lodging in her house for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing, and you will put them on your sons and your daughters; and you will plunder the Egyptians.”"],["However, Moses answered: “But suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘Jehovah did not appear to you.’”","Then Jehovah said to him: “What is that in your hand?” He answered: “A rod.”","He said: “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.” So he reached out and seized it, and it became a rod in his hand.","God then said: “This is so that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”","Jehovah said to him once more: “Put your hand, please, into the upper fold of your garment.” So he put his hand into the fold of his garment. When he drew it out, why, his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow!","Then he said: “Return your hand into the upper fold of your garment.” So he returned his hand into his garment. When he drew it out of the garment, it was restored like the rest of his flesh!","He said: “If they will not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, then they will certainly heed the next sign.","Still, even if they will not believe these two signs and refuse to listen to your voice, you will take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry land, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land.”","Moses now said to Jehovah: “Pardon me, Jehovah, but I have never been a fluent speaker, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech  and slow of tongue.”","Jehovah said to him: “Who made a mouth for man, or who makes them speechless, deaf, clear-sighted, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?","So go now, and I will be with you as you speak,  and I will teach you what you should say.”","But he said: “Pardon me, Jehovah, please send anyone whom you want to send.”","Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against Moses, and he said: “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak very well. And he is now on his way here to meet you. When he sees you, his heart will rejoice.","So you must speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with you and him as you speak, and I will teach you men what to do.","He will speak for you to the people, and he will be your spokesman, and you will serve as God to him.","And you  will take this rod in your hand and perform the signs with it.”","So Moses went back to Jethʹro his father-in-law and said to him: “I want to go, please, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.” Jethʹro said to Moses: “Go in peace.”","After that Jehovah said to Moses in Midʹi·an: “Go, return to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking to kill you  are dead.”","Then Moses took his wife and his sons and lifted them onto a donkey, and he started back to the land of Egypt. Moreover, Moses took the rod of the true God in his hand.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “After you have returned to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharʹaoh all the miracles that I have empowered you to do. But I will allow his heart to become obstinate, and he will not send the people away.","You must say to Pharʹaoh, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Israel is my son, my firstborn.","I say to you, Send my son away so that he may serve me. But if you refuse to send him away, I am going to kill your son, your firstborn.”’”","Now on the road at the lodging place, Jehovah met him and was seeking to put him to death.","Finally Zip·poʹrah took a flint  and circumcised her son and caused his foreskin to touch his feet and said: “It is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”","So He let him go. At that time she said, “a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.","Then Jehovah said to Aaron: “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of the true God and greeted him with a kiss.","And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah, who had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.","After that Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the Israelites.","Aaron told them all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people.","At this the people believed. When they heard that Jehovah had turned his attention to the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down and prostrated themselves."],["Afterward, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharʹaoh: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’”","But Pharʹaoh said: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all, and what is more, I will not send Israel away.”","But they said: “The God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. Please, we want to make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise, he will strike us with disease or with the sword.”","The king of Egypt replied to them: “Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that you are taking the people away from their work? Return to your labor!”","And Pharʹaoh continued: “Look at how many people of the land there are, and you would have them rest from their labor.”","That same day, Pharʹaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen:","“You must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks. Let them go  and gather straw for themselves.","But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past. Do not reduce it for them, for they are relaxing.  That is why they are crying out, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our God!’","Make them work harder, and keep them busy so that they will not pay attention to lies.”","So the taskmasters and their foremen went out and said to the people: “Here is what Pharʹaoh has said, ‘I am giving you no more straw.","Go and get your own straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’”","Then the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.","And the taskmasters kept urging them: “You must each finish your work every day, just as when straw was provided.”","Also the foremen of the Israelites, whom Pharʹaoh’s taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. They asked them: “Why did you not reach the quota of bricks that you used to make? It happened both yesterday and today.”","So the foremen of the Israelites went in and complained to Pharʹaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way?","No straw is given to your servants, yet they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are beaten, but your own people are at fault.”","But he said: “You are relaxing,  you are relaxing!  That is why you are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’","So now go, get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still produce your quota of bricks.”","Then the foremen of the Israelites saw that they were in serious trouble because of the order: “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks at all.”","After that they met up with Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Pharʹaoh.","At once they said to them: “May Jehovah look upon you and judge, since you have made Pharʹaoh and his servants despise us  and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”","Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said: “Jehovah, why have you afflicted this people? Why have you sent me?","From the time that I went in before Pharʹaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt worse with this people, and you have certainly not rescued your people.”"],["So Jehovah said to Moses: “Now you will see what I will do to Pharʹaoh. A mighty hand will force him to send them away, and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out of his land.”","Then God said to Moses: “I am Jehovah.","And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.","I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Caʹnaan, the land in which they lived as foreigners.","Now I myself have heard the groaning of the people of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I remember my covenant.","“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery, and I will reclaim you with an outstretched  arm and with  great judgments.","And I will take you in as my people, and I will be your God, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt.","And I will bring you into the land that I swore with an oath  to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as something to possess. I am Jehovah.’”","Moses later gave this message to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses because of their discouragement and because of the harsh slavery.","Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:","“Go in and tell Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, that he should send the Israelites away out of his land.”","However, Moses replied to Jehovah: “Look! The Israelites have not listened to me; how will Pharʹaoh ever listen to me, as I speak with difficulty?”","But Jehovah again told Moses and Aaron what commands to give to the Israelites and to Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, in order to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.","These are the heads of the house of their fathers: The sons of Reuʹben, Israel’s firstborn, were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi. These are the families of Reuʹben.","The sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul, the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman. These are the families of Simʹe·on.","These are the names of the sons of Leʹvi, according to their family descents: Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi. The length of Leʹvi’s life was 137 years.","The sons of Gerʹshon were Libʹni and Shimʹe·i, according to their families.","The sons of Koʹhath were Amʹram, Izʹhar, Hebʹron, and Uzʹzi·el. The length of Koʹhath’s life was 133 years.","The sons of Me·rarʹi were Mahʹli and Muʹshi.","Now Amʹram took Jochʹe·bed, his father’s sister, as his wife. She bore him Aaron and Moses. The length of Amʹram’s life was 137 years.","The sons of Izʹhar were Korʹah, Neʹpheg, and Zichʹri.","The sons of Uzʹzi·el were Mishʹa·el, El·zaʹphan, and Sithʹri.","Now Aaron took E·liʹshe·ba, Am·minʹa·dab’s daughter, the sister of Nahʹshon, as his wife. She bore him Naʹdab, A·biʹhu, El·e·aʹzar, and Ithʹa·mar.","The sons of Korʹah were Asʹsir, El·kaʹnah, and A·biʹa·saph. These were the families of the Korʹah·ites.","El·e·aʹzar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Puʹti·el as his wife. She bore him Phinʹe·has.","This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said: “Bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, company by company.”","It was they who spoke to Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt. It was this Moses and Aaron.","On that day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,","Jehovah told Moses: “I am Jehovah. Speak to Pharʹaoh, king of Egypt, everything I am speaking to you.”","Then Moses said before Jehovah:  “Look! I speak with difficulty,  so how will Pharʹaoh ever listen to me?”"],["Jehovah then said to Moses: “See, I have made you like God  to Pharʹaoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet.","You are to repeat everything that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharʹaoh, and he will send the Israelites away from his land.","As for me, I will allow Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and I will multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt.","But Pharʹaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my multitudes,  my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments.","And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.”","Moses and Aaron did what Jehovah had commanded them; they did just so.","Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to Pharʹaoh.","Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron:","“If Pharʹaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod and throw it down before Pharʹaoh.’ It will become a big snake.”","So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharʹaoh and did exactly as Jehovah had commanded. Aaron threw his rod down before Pharʹaoh and his servants, and it became a big snake.","However, Pharʹaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and the magic-practicing priests of Egypt also did the same thing with their magic.","Each one threw down his rod, and they became big snakes; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.","Still, Pharʹaoh’s heart became obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Pharʹaoh’s heart is unresponsive. He has refused to send the people away.","Go to Pharʹaoh in the morning. Look! He is going out to the water! And you should station yourself to meet him by the edge of the Nile River; and take with you in your hand the rod that turned into a serpent.","And you must say to him, ‘Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, and he says: “Send my people away so that they may serve me in the wilderness,” but you have not obeyed until now.","This is what Jehovah says: “By this you will know that I am Jehovah. Here I am striking the water that is in the Nile River with the rod that is in my hand, and it will turn into blood.","And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will find it impossible to drink water from the Nile.”’”","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over its rivers, over its canals,  over its marshes, and over all its reservoirs, that they may become blood.’ There will be blood in all the land of Egypt, even in the wooden and stone containers.”","Immediately Moses and Aaron did just as Jehovah had commanded. He lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile River before the eyes of Pharʹaoh and his servants, and all the water that was in  the river was turned into blood.","And the fish that were in the river died, and the river began to stink, and the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the Nile, and there was blood throughout the land of Egypt.","Nevertheless, the magic-practicing priests of Egypt did the same thing with their secret arts, so that Pharʹaoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.","Then Pharʹaoh returned to his house, and he did not take this to heart either.","So all the Egyptians were digging all around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink any water of the Nile.","And seven full days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile."],["Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Pharʹaoh and say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Send my people away so that they may serve me.","If you keep refusing to send them away, I will plague all your territory with frogs.","And the Nile River will swarm with frogs, and they will come up and enter into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants and on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs.","On you, on your people, and on all your servants, the frogs will come up.”’”","Jehovah later said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, the Nile canals, and the marshes, and make the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.’”","So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of Egypt.","However, the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts, and they too made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.","Pharʹaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said: “Plead with Jehovah to remove the frogs from me and my people, as I want to send the people away so that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.”","Then Moses said to Pharʹaoh: “I leave to you the honor of telling me when I should plead to have the frogs removed from you, your servants, your people, and your houses. Only in the Nile River will they be left.”","To this he said: “Tomorrow.” So he said: “It will be according to your word so that you may know that there is no one else like Jehovah our God.","The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people. They will be left only in the Nile.”","So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharʹaoh, and Moses pleaded with Jehovah about the frogs that He had brought upon Pharʹaoh.","Then Jehovah did as Moses asked, and the frogs began to die in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.","They were piling them up in countless heaps, and the land began to stink.","When Pharʹaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and he refused to listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, and it must become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’”","And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and the gnats came on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.","The magic-practicing  priests tried to do the same and produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. And the gnats came on man and beast.","So the magic-practicing priests said to Pharʹaoh: “It is the finger of God!” But Pharʹaoh’s heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of Pharʹaoh. Look! He is coming out to the water! And you must say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Send my people away so that they may serve me.","But if you do not send my people away, I will send on you, your servants, and your people and into your houses the gadfly;  and the houses of Egypt will be full of gadflies, and they will even cover the ground they  stand on.","On that day I will certainly set apart the land of Goʹshen, where my people are dwelling. No gadflies will exist there, and by this you will know that I, Jehovah, am here in the land.","And I will make a distinction between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will take place.”’”","And Jehovah did so, and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of Pharʹaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land was ruined by the gadflies.","Finally, Pharʹaoh called Moses and Aaron and said: “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”","But Moses said: “It is not proper to do so, because what we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we would make a sacrifice that was detestable to the Egyptians right before their eyes, would they not stone us?","We will make a three-day journey into the wilderness, and there we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, just as he has said to us.”","Pharʹaoh now said: “I will send you away to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness. Only, you must not go so far away. Plead in my behalf.”","Then Moses said: “Now I am going away from you, and I will plead with Jehovah, and the gadflies will depart from Pharʹaoh, his servants, and his people tomorrow. But Pharʹaoh must stop trifling  with us by refusing to send the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.”","Moses then went out from Pharʹaoh and pleaded with Jehovah.","So Jehovah did according to Moses’ word, and the gadflies departed from Pharʹaoh, his servants, and his people. Not one was left.","However, Pharʹaoh again hardened his heart and did not send the people away."],["So Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Pharʹaoh and say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away so that they may serve me.","But if you refuse to send them away and you keep holding them,","look! Jehovah’s hand will come against your livestock in the field. On the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herd, and the flock, there will be a devastating plague.","And Jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die.”’”","Moreover, Jehovah set an appointed time, saying: “Tomorrow Jehovah will do this in the land.”","And Jehovah did this on the very next day, and all sorts of livestock of Egypt began to die, but not one of Israel’s livestock died.","When Pharʹaoh inquired, look! not so much as one of Israel’s livestock had died. Nevertheless, Pharʹaoh’s heart continued to be unresponsive, and he did not send the people away.","Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron: “Fill both of your hands with soot from a kiln, and Moses must throw it into the air in front of Pharʹaoh.","And it will become a fine dust on all the land of Egypt, and it will become festering boils on man and beast in all the land of Egypt.”","So they took soot from a kiln and stood before Pharʹaoh, and Moses tossed it into the air, and it became festering boils breaking out on man and beast.","The magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before Moses because of the boils, for they had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the Egyptians.","But Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had told Moses.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of Pharʹaoh, and say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: “Send my people away so that they may serve me.","For now I am directing all my blows to strike your heart, your servants, and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.","For by now I could have thrust my hand out to strike you and your people with a devastating plague, and you would have been wiped out  from the earth.","But for this very reason I have kept you in existence: to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth.","Are you still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away?","Here I will cause a very great hail to rain down tomorrow about this time, such as has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.","Therefore, send word to bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter. Every man and beast caught in the field and not brought into the house will die when the hail comes down on them.”’”","Anyone among Pharʹaoh’s servants who feared Jehovah’s word quickly brought his own servants and his livestock into the houses,","but whoever did not take Jehovah’s word to heart left his servants and his livestock in the field.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, so that hail may come down on all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.”","So Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire  fell down to the earth, and Jehovah kept making it rain down hail on the land of Egypt.","There was hail, and there was fire flashing in the midst of the hail. It was very heavy; there had never been any like it in the land since Egypt had become a nation.","The hail struck everything in the field throughout the land of Egypt, from man to beast, and it struck down all the vegetation and shattered all the trees of the field.","Only in  the land of Goʹshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.","So Pharʹaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them: “I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are in the wrong.","Plead with Jehovah that there may be an end to God’s thunder and hail. Then I will be willing to send you away, and you will not stay any longer.”","So Moses said to him: “As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands before Jehovah. The thunder will stop and the hail will not continue any longer, so that you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah.","But as for you and your servants, I know already that even then, you will not fear Jehovah God.”","Now the flax and the barley had been struck down, because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds.","But the wheat and the spelt had not been struck down, because they were later crops.","Moses now went out of the city from Pharʹaoh and spread out his hands before Jehovah, and the thunder and the hail stopped and the rain quit pouring down on the earth.","When Pharʹaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he as well as his servants.","And Pharʹaoh’s heart continued obstinate, and he did not send the Israelites away, just as Jehovah had stated through Moses."],["Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go in to Pharʹaoh, for I have allowed his heart and the hearts of his servants to become unresponsive, so that I may display these signs of mine right before him,","and in order that you may declare to your sons and your grandsons how severely I have dealt with Egypt and what signs I have performed among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.”","So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharʹaoh and said to him: “This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said, ‘How long will you refuse to submit to me? Send my people away so that they may serve me.","For if you keep refusing to send my people away, here I am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow.","And they will cover the surface of the earth, and it will not be possible to see the ground. They will eat up what escaped the hail and was left for you, and they will eat all your trees that are growing in the field.","They will fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all Egypt to an extent that your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the time they have been in this land until today.’” With that he turned and went out from Pharʹaoh.","Then Pharʹaoh’s servants said to him: “How long will this man continue to menace  us? Send the men away so that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt has been ruined?”","So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharʹaoh, and he said to them: “Go, serve Jehovah your God. But just who will be going?”","Then Moses said: “We will go with our young people, our old people, our sons, our daughters, our sheep, and our cattle, because we will hold a festival to Jehovah.”","He said to them: “If I ever send you and your children away, then Jehovah is  indeed with you! It is clear that you intend to do something evil.","No! Only your men may go and serve Jehovah, for that is what you requested.” With that they were driven out from before Pharʹaoh.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land, everything that the hail has let remain.”","At once Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow on the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind brought the locusts.","And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole territory of Egypt. It was extremely severe; never before had there been so many locusts, nor would there ever be so many again.","They covered the surface of the entire land, and the land grew dark with them; they devoured all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt.","So Pharʹaoh quickly called Moses and Aaron and said: “I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.","Now, please, pardon my sin just this once, and plead with Jehovah your God that he just remove this deadly plague from upon me.”","So he  went out from Pharʹaoh and pleaded with Jehovah.","Then Jehovah caused the wind to shift, and it became a very stiff west wind, and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.","However, Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he did not send the Israelites away.","Jehovah then said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness so thick that it can be felt.”","Moses immediately stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was a dense darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.","They did not see one another, and none of them got up from where they were for three days; but all the Israelites had light in their dwellings.","Pharʹaoh then called Moses and said: “Go, serve Jehovah. Only your sheep and your cattle will remain behind. Even your children may go with you.”","But Moses said: “You yourself will also provide us with  sacrifices and burnt offerings, and we will offer them to Jehovah our God.","Our livestock will also go with us. Not an animal  will be allowed to remain, because we will be using some of them to worship Jehovah our God, and we do not know what we will offer in worship to Jehovah until we arrive there.”","So Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he did not consent to send them away.","Pharʹaoh said to him: “Get out of my sight! Make sure that you do not try to see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”","To this Moses said: “Just as you have spoken, I will not try to see your face again.”"],["Then Jehovah said to Moses: “One more plague I am going to bring upon Pharʹaoh and Egypt. After that he will  send you away from here. When he does send you away, he will literally drive you out of here.","Now tell the people that all the men and women should ask their neighbor for articles of silver and of gold.”","And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself had become highly esteemed in the land of Egypt among Pharʹaoh’s servants and among the people.","Moses then said: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,","and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharʹaoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who is working at the hand mill, and every firstborn of the livestock.","Throughout all the land of Egypt, there will be a great outcry such as has never occurred nor will ever occur again.","But not even a dog will bark  at the Israelites, at the men or their livestock, so that you may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.’","And all your servants will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you.’ And after that I will go out.” With that he went out from Pharʹaoh in the heat of anger.","Jehovah then said to Moses: “Pharʹaoh will not listen to you, in order for my miracles to be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”","Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharʹaoh, but Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, so that he did not send the Israelites away from his land."],["Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:","“This month will be the beginning of the months for you. It will be the first of the months of the year for you.","Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they should each take for themselves a sheep for their father’s house, a sheep to a house.","But if the household is too small for the sheep, they and their  nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their house according to the number of people.  When making the calculation, determine how much of the sheep each one will eat.","Your sheep should be a sound, one-year-old male. You may choose from the young rams or from the goats.","You must care for it until the 14th day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight.","They must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it.","“‘They must eat the meat on this night. They should roast it over the fire and eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter greens.","Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, cooked in water, but roast it over the fire, its head together with its shanks and its inner parts.","You must not save any of it until morning, but any of it left over until morning you should burn with fire.","And this is how you should eat it, with your belt fastened,  sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you should eat it in a hurry. It is Jehovah’s Passover.","For I  will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah.","The blood will serve as your sign on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass over you, and the plague will not come on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.","“‘This day will serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a lasting statute, you should celebrate it.","Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread. Yes, on the first day you are to remove the sourdough from your houses, because anyone eating what is leavened from the first day down to the seventh, that person  must be cut off  from Israel.","On the first day you will hold a holy convention, and on the seventh day, another holy convention. No work is to be done on these days. Only what every person  needs to eat, that alone may be prepared for you.","“‘You must keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day, I will bring your multitudes  out of the land of Egypt. And you must keep this day throughout your generations as a lasting statute.","In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, in the evening, you are to eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month, in the evening.","No sourdough is to be found in your houses for seven days, because if anyone eats what is leavened, whether he is a foreigner or a native of the land, that person  must be cut off  from the assembly of Israel.","You should not eat anything leavened. In all your homes, you are to eat unleavened bread.’”","Moses promptly called all the elders of Israel and said to them: “Go and select young animals  for each of your families, and slaughter the Passover sacrifice.","Then you must dip a bunch of hyssop into the blood that is in a basin and strike the upper part of the doorway and the two doorposts with the blood; and none of you should go out of the entrance of his house until morning.","Then when Jehovah passes through to plague the Egyptians and sees the blood on the upper part of the doorway and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance, and he will not allow the plague of death  to enter into your houses.","“You must observe this event as a lasting regulation for you and your sons.","And when you come into the land that Jehovah will give you just as he has stated, you must keep this observance.","And when your sons ask you, ‘What does this observance mean to you?’","you must say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he plagued the Egyptians, but he spared our houses.’”","So the Israelites went and did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.","Then at midnight, Jehovah struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the  firstborn of Pharʹaoh who was sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison,  and every firstborn of the animals.","Pharʹaoh got up that night along with all his servants and all the other Egyptians, and there was a great outcry among the Egyptians, because there was not a house where someone was not dead.","At once he called Moses and Aaron by night and said: “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the other Israelites. Go and serve Jehovah, just as you have said.","Take also your flocks and your herds and go, just as you have said. But you must also bless me.”","And the Egyptians began to urge the people to depart quickly out of the land “because,” as they said, “we are all as good as dead!”","So the people carried their flour dough before it was leavened, with their kneading troughs  wrapped up in their clothing on their shoulder.","The Israelites did what Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing.","Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they asked for, and they plundered the Egyptians.","Then the Israelites departed from Ramʹe·ses for Sucʹcoth, about 600,000 men on foot, besides children.","And a vast mixed company  also went with them, as well as flocks and herds, a great number of livestock.","They began to bake the dough that they brought from Egypt into round loaves of unleavened bread. It was not leavened, because they had been driven out of Egypt so suddenly that they had not prepared any provisions for themselves.","The dwelling of the Israelites, who had dwelled in Egypt, was 430 years.","At the end of the 430 years, on this very day, all the multitudes  of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt.","It is a night on which they will celebrate Jehovah’s bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This night is to be observed to Jehovah by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.","Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat of it.","But if someone has a slave man who was purchased with money, you should circumcise him. Only then may he share in eating it.","A settler and a hired worker may not eat of it.","In one house it is to be eaten. You must not take any of the meat outside of the house, and you must not break any of its bones.","All the assembly of Israel are to celebrate it.","If a foreigner resides with you and he wants to celebrate the Passover to Jehovah, every male of his must be circumcised. Then he may come near to celebrate it, and he will become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.","One law will apply for the native and for the foreigner who is residing among you.”","So all the Israelites did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.","On this very day, Jehovah brought the Israelites along with their multitudes  out of the land of Egypt."],["Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:","“Sanctify  to me every firstborn male  among the Israelites. The first male to be born, of both human and animal, belongs to me.”","Then Moses said to the people: “Remember this day on which you went out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, because with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of here. So nothing leavened may be eaten.","You are going out on this day, in the month of Aʹbib.","When Jehovah has brought you into the land of the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, which he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you must keep this observance in this month.","Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, there will be a festival to Jehovah.","Unleavened bread is to be eaten for the seven days; and nothing leavened is to be found with you, and no sourdough is to be found with you within all your territory.","And you must tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt.’","And this will serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial  on your forehead,  so that Jehovah’s law may be in your mouth, for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt.","You must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.","“When Jehovah brings you into the land of the Caʹnaan·ites, which he has sworn to you and to your forefathers to give to you,","you must devote to Jehovah every firstborn male,  as well as every male firstling of the livestock that you acquire. The males belong to Jehovah.","Every firstling donkey you are to redeem with a sheep, and if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. And every firstborn male of your sons you are to redeem.","“In case your son should ask you later on, ‘What does this mean?’ then you should say to him, ‘With a mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.","When Pharʹaoh stubbornly refused to send us away, Jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast. That is why I am sacrificing to Jehovah all the firstborn males,  and I redeem every firstborn of my sons.’","This must serve as a sign on your hand and as a headband on your forehead,  for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.”","Now when Pharʹaoh sent the people away, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Phi·lisʹtines, although it was near. For God said: “The people may change their minds when they are confronted by war and will return to Egypt.”","So God made the people go around by the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. But it was in battle formation that the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt.","Moses also took Joseph’s bones with him, because Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear: “God will not fail to turn his attention to you, and you must take my  bones up out of here with you.”","They departed from Sucʹcoth and encamped at Eʹtham, at the edge of the wilderness.","Now Jehovah was going ahead of them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day and by night.","The pillar of cloud would not move away from before the people during the day, nor the pillar of fire at night."],["Jehovah now said to Moses:","“Tell the Israelites that they should turn back and encamp before Pi·ha·hiʹroth, between Migʹdol and the sea, within view of Baʹal-zeʹphon. You are to encamp facing it by the sea.","Then Pharʹaoh will say about the Israelites, ‘They are wandering in confusion in the land. The wilderness has closed in on them.’","I will allow Pharʹaoh’s heart to become obstinate, and he will chase after them, and I will glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” So that is what they did.","Later it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away. Immediately, Pharʹaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people, and they said: “Why did we do this and release Israel from serving as slaves for us?”","So he made his war chariots ready, and he took his people with him.","He took 600 chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with warriors on every one of them.","Thus Jehovah allowed the heart of Pharʹaoh king of Egypt to become obstinate, and he chased after the Israelites, while the Israelites were going out with confidence.","The Egyptians chased after them, and all the chariot horses of Pharʹaoh and his cavalrymen and his army were catching up with them while they were camping by the sea, by Pi·ha·hiʹroth, facing Baʹal-zeʹphon.","When Pharʹaoh got closer, the Israelites raised their eyes and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. The Israelites became terrified and began to cry out to Jehovah.","They said to Moses: “Is it because there are no burial places in Egypt that you have brought us here to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by leading us out of Egypt?","Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt when we said, ‘Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”","Then Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah that he will perform for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you will never ever see again.","Jehovah himself will fight for you, and you will keep silent.”","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Why do you keep crying out to me? Tell the Israelites that they should break camp.","As for you, lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground.","As for me, I am allowing the hearts of the Egyptians to become obstinate, so that they will go in after them; thus I will glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh and all his army, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen.","And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I glorify myself by means of Pharʹaoh, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen.”","Then the angel of the true God who was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their rear, and the pillar of cloud that was in front of them moved to the rear and stood behind them.","So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. On the one side, it was a dark cloud. On the other side, it was lighting up the night. So the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long.","Moses now stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah drove the sea back with a strong east wind all night long, turning the sea basin into dry ground, and the waters divided.","So the Israelites went through the midst of the sea on dry ground, while the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left.","The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharʹaoh’s horses, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen began going after them into the midst of the sea.","During the morning watch,  Jehovah looked at the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion.","He kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty, and the Egyptians were saying: “Let us flee from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, their war chariots, and their cavalrymen.”","Moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea, and as morning approached, the sea returned to its normal condition. As the Egyptians fled from it, Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea.","The returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and all of Pharʹaoh’s army who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as one among them was allowed to survive.","But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the seabed, and the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left.","Thus Jehovah saved Israel on that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.","Israel also saw the great power  that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians, and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in his servant Moses."],["At that time Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Jehovah:","2  My strength and my might is Jah,  since he has become my salvation.","3  Jehovah is a powerful warrior. Jehovah is his name.","4  Pharʹaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea,","5  The surging waters covered them; down into the depths they sank like a stone.","6  Your right hand, O Jehovah, is great in power;","7  In your great majesty you can throw down those who rise up against you;","8  By a breath from your nostrils waters massed together;","9  The enemy said: ‘I will pursue! I will overtake!","You blew with your breath, the sea covered them;","Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah?","You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them up.","In your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemed;","Peoples must hear; they will shudder;","At that time the sheikhs  of Eʹdom will be terrified,","Fear and dread will fall upon them.","You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,","Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever.","When Pharʹaoh’s horses with his war chariots and his cavalrymen went into the sea,","Then Mirʹi·am the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and with dances.","Mirʹi·am sang in response to the men:","Moses later led Israel away from the Red Sea, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur and marched on for three days in the wilderness, but they did not find water.","They came to Maʹrah,  but they were not able to drink the water from Maʹrah because it was bitter. That is why he named it Maʹrah.","So the people began to murmur against Moses, saying: “What are we to drink?”","He cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah directed him to a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became sweet.","He said: “If you will strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in his eyes and will pay attention to his commandments and keep all his regulations, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians, for I, Jehovah, am healing you.”","After that they came to Eʹlim, where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees. So they camped there by the water."],["After they departed from Eʹlim, the entire assembly of the Israelites eventually came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Eʹlim and Siʹnai, on the 15th day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.","Then the entire assembly of the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.","The Israelites kept saying to them: “If only we had died by Jehovah’s hand in the land of Egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat, while we were eating bread to satisfaction. Now you have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine.”","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Here I am raining down bread for you from the heavens, and each of the people should go out to gather his amount day by day, so that I may put them to the test to see whether they will walk in my law or not.","But on the sixth day when they prepare what they have gathered, it is to be double the amount that they pick up on each of the other days.”","So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: “In the evening you will certainly know that it is Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt.","In the morning you will see Jehovah’s glory, for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah. Who are we that you should murmur against us?”","Moses continued: “When Jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening and in the morning bread to satisfaction, you will see that Jehovah has heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him. But who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.”","Then Moses said to Aaron: “Tell the entire assembly of the Israelites, ‘Come near before Jehovah, for he has heard your murmurings.’”","As soon as Aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the Israelites, they turned and faced toward the wilderness, and look! Jehovah’s glory appeared in the cloud.","Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:","“I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight  you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied  with bread, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God.’”","So that evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp.","When the layer of dew evaporated, there was a fine, flaky substance on the surface of the wilderness, as fine as frost on the ground.","When the Israelites saw it, they began to say to one another, “What is it?” for they did not know what it was. Moses said to them: “It is the bread that Jehovah has given you for food.","This is what Jehovah has commanded, ‘Each one should gather it according to how much he can eat. You are to take an omer measure  for each individual according to the number of the people  that each of you has in his tent.’”","The Israelites began to do so; they gathered it, some gathering much and some gathering little.","When they would measure it by the omer, the one who had gathered much had no surplus and the one who had gathered little had no shortage. They each gathered it according to what they could eat.","Then Moses said to them: “Nobody should leave any of it until the morning.”","But they did not listen to Moses. When some men left some of it until the morning, it bred worms and stank, and Moses became indignant at them.","They would pick it up morning by morning, each one according to what he could eat. When the sun got hot, it melted.","On the sixth day, they picked up twice as much bread, two omer measures for each person. So all the chieftains of the assembly came and reported it to Moses.","At that he said to them: “It is what Jehovah has said. Tomorrow there will be a complete rest,  a holy sabbath to Jehovah. Bake what you need to bake, and boil what you need to boil; then save whatever is left over and keep it until the morning.”","So they saved it until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink nor were there maggots in it.","Then Moses said: “Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today you will not find it on the ground.","You will pick it up for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”","However, some of the people did go out to pick it up on the seventh day, but they found nothing.","So Jehovah said to Moses: “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?","Take notice of the fact that Jehovah has given you the Sabbath. That is why he is giving you the bread for two days on the sixth day. Everyone must stay where he is; nobody is to leave his locality on the seventh day.”","So the people observed the Sabbath  on the seventh day.","The house of Israel named the bread “manna.”  It was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey.","Then Moses said: “This is what Jehovah has commanded, ‘Fill an omer measure of it as something to be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I was bringing you out of the land of Egypt.’”","So Moses said to Aaron: “Take a jar  and put in it an omer measure of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations.”","Just as Jehovah commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the Testimony so that it might be preserved.","The Israelites ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to a land that was inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the frontier of the land of Caʹnaan.","Now an omer is a tenth of an eʹphah measure."],["The entire assembly of the Israelites departed from the wilderness of Sin by stages according to the order of Jehovah, and they camped at Rephʹi·dim. But there was no water for the people to drink.","So the people began quarreling with Moses and saying: “Give us water to drink.” But Moses said to them: “Why are you quarreling with me? Why do you keep putting Jehovah to the test?”","But the people were very thirsty for water there, and they kept murmuring against Moses and saying: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our livestock with thirst?”","Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah: “What should I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!”","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go ahead of the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River. Take it in your hand and walk on.","Look! I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horʹeb. You must strike the rock, and water will come out of it, and the people will drink it.” Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.","So he named the place Masʹsah  and Merʹi·bah  because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put Jehovah to the test by saying: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?”","Then the A·malʹek·ites came and fought against Israel in Rephʹi·dim.","At this Moses said to Joshua: “Choose men for us and go out to fight against the A·malʹek·ites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill, with the rod of the true God in my hand.”","Then Joshua did just as Moses told him, and he fought against the A·malʹek·ites. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.","As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up, the Israelites prevailed, but as soon as he would let down his hands, the A·malʹek·ites prevailed.","When the hands of Moses were heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported his hands, so that his hands remained steady until the sun set.","Thus Joshua defeated Amʹa·lek and his people with the sword.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Write this as a memorial  in the book and repeat it to Joshua, ‘I will completely wipe out the memory of Amʹa·lek from under the heavens.’”","Then Moses built an altar and named it Je·hoʹvah-nisʹsi,","saying: “Because his hand is against the throne of Jah, Jehovah will have war with Amʹa·lek from generation to generation.”"],["Now Jethʹro the priest of Midʹi·an, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and  for his people Israel, how Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.","Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Zip·poʹrah, Moses’ wife, when she was sent back to him,","along with her two sons. One son was named Gerʹshom,  because Moses said, “I have become a foreign resident in a foreign land,”","and the other was named E·li·eʹzer,  because he said, “The God of my father is my helper, who rescued me from Pharʹaoh’s sword.”","So Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, along with Moses’ sons and his wife, came to Moses into the wilderness where he was camping at the mountain of the true God.","Then he sent word to Moses: “I, your father-in-law Jethʹro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”","At once Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him. Each of them asked about the other’s welfare, and then they went into the tent.","Moses related to his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharʹaoh and Egypt in behalf of Israel, all the hardships that had befallen them along the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them.","Jethʹro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done for Israel by rescuing them from Egypt.","Then Jethʹro said: “Praised be Jehovah, who rescued you from Egypt and from Pharʹaoh, and who rescued the people from under Egypt’s control.","Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods, because of what he did to those who acted arrogantly against his people.”","Then Jethʹro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before the true God.","On the next day, Moses sat down as usual to serve as judge for the people, and the people kept standing before Moses from morning until evening.","When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said: “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit here alone with all the people standing before you from morning until evening?”","Moses said to his father-in-law: “Because the people keep coming to me to inquire of God.","When a case arises, it comes to me and I must judge between one person and the other, and I make known the decisions of the true God and his laws.”","Moses’ father-in-law said to him: “What you are doing is not good.","You will surely wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because this is too big a load for you and you cannot carry it by yourself.","Now listen to me. I will give you advice, and God will be with you. You serve as representative for the people before the true God, and you must bring the cases to the true God.","You should warn them about what the regulations and the laws are and make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do.","But you should select from the people capable men fearing God, trustworthy men hating dishonest profit, and appoint these over them as chiefs over thousands, chiefs over hundreds, chiefs over fifties, and chiefs over tens.","They should judge the  people when cases arise,  and they will bring every difficult case to you, but every minor case they will decide. Make it easier for yourself by letting them share the load along with you.","If you do this, and God so commands you, you will be able to stand the strain, and everyone will go home satisfied.”","Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said.","Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.","So they judged the people when cases arose. A difficult case they would bring to Moses, but every minor case they would judge.","After that Moses saw his father-in-law off, and he went his way to his land."],["In the third month after the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the wilderness of Siʹnai.","They pulled away from Rephʹi·dim and came to the wilderness of Siʹnai and camped in the wilderness. Israel camped there in front of the mountain.","Then Moses went up to the true God, and Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying: “This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and to tell the Israelites,","‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to the Egyptians, in order to carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself.","Now if you will strictly obey my voice and keep my covenant, you will certainly become my special property  out of all peoples, for the whole earth belongs to me.","You will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.”","So Moses went and summoned the elders of the people and declared to them all these words that Jehovah had commanded him.","After that all the people answered unanimously: “All that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do.” Moses immediately took the people’s response to Jehovah.","And Jehovah said to Moses: “Look! I am coming to you in a dark cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they may always put faith in you as well.” Then Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they must wash their clothing.","And they must be ready for the third day, because on the third day Jehovah will come down upon Mount Siʹnai before the eyes of all the people.","You must set boundaries for the people all around it and tell them, ‘Beware of going up to the mountain or touching its border. Anybody touching the mountain will surely be put to death.","No hand is to touch him, but he will either be stoned or be shot through.  Whether beast or man, he will not live.’ But at the sound of the ram’s horn they may come up to the mountain.”","Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he began to sanctify the people, and they washed their clothing.","He said to the people: “Get ready for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”","On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and  lightning, and there was a heavy cloud on the mountain and a very loud sound of a horn, and all the people in the camp began to tremble.","Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they took their place at the base of the mountain.","Mount Siʹnai smoked all over, because Jehovah came down upon it in fire; and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling violently.","As the sound of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of the true God answered him.","So Jehovah came down upon Mount Siʹnai to the top of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go down and warn the people not to try to force their way through to look at Jehovah, or many of them will perish.","And let the priests who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify themselves, so that Jehovah may not strike  them.”","Moses then said to Jehovah: “The people are not able to come up to Mount Siʹnai because you already warned us, saying, ‘Set boundaries around the mountain, and make it sacred.’”","However, Jehovah said to him: “Go, descend, and come back up, you and Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people force their way through to come up to Jehovah, so that he may not strike them.”","So Moses descended to the people and told them."],["Then God spoke all these words:","“I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.","You must not have any other gods besides me.","“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form  like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.","You must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them, for I, Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me,","but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.","“You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up His name in a worthless way.","“Remember the Sabbath day to keep it sacred.","You are to labor and do all your work for six days,","but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your foreign resident who is inside your settlements.","For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and he began to rest on the seventh day. That is why Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it sacred.","“Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live a long time in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.","“You must not murder.","“You must not commit adultery.","“You must not steal.","“You must not testify falsely when you are a witness against your fellow man.","“You must not desire your fellow man’s house. You must not desire your fellow man’s wife nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man.”","Now all the people were witnessing the thunder and lightning, the sound of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and seeing this made them tremble and stand at a distance.","So they said to Moses: “You speak with us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak with us, for fear that we will die.”","So Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid, for the true God has come to put you to the test, in order that the fear of him may continue with you so that you may not sin.”","So the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went near to the dark cloud where the true God was.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “This is what you are to say to the Israelites, ‘You have seen for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven.","You must not make gods of silver alongside me, and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves.","An altar of earth you are to make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, your communion sacrifices,  your flock, and your herd.

It should be like the opening of a coat of mail, so that it will not be torn.","You should make pomegranates of blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material all around its hem, along with bells of gold in between them.","You should alternate a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the sleeveless coat.","It must be worn by Aaron so that he may minister, and the sound from it must be heard when he goes into the sanctuary before Jehovah and when he comes out, so that he will not die.","“You are to make a shining plate of pure gold and engrave on it as one would engrave a seal: ‘Holiness belongs to Jehovah.’","You must fasten it to the turban with a blue cord; it is to remain on the front of the turban.","It will be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron will bear responsibility when someone commits an error against the holy things, which the Israelites sanctify when they offer them as holy gifts.

You are to make them with fine wheat flour","and put them in a basket and present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams.","“You will present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.","Then you are to take the garments and clothe Aaron with the robe, the sleeveless coat of the ephʹod, the ephʹod, and the breastpiece, and you are to tie the woven belt  of the ephʹod securely around his waist.","You will put the turban on his head and put the holy sign of dedication  on the turban;","and take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.","“Then bring his sons forward and clothe them with the robes","and wrap the sashes around them, Aaron as well as his sons, and put on their headgear; and the priesthood will become theirs as a permanent statute. This is how you should install Aaron and his sons to serve as priests.","“You are now to present the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the bull’s head.","Slaughter the bull before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.","Take some of the bull’s blood on your finger and put it on the horns of the altar, and pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.","Then take all the fat that covers the intestines, the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them so that they smoke on the altar.","But the bull’s flesh and its skin and its dung, you will burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.","“Then take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the ram’s head.","Slaughter the ram and take its blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar.","Cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its intestines and its shanks, and arrange the pieces together with its head.","You must burn the entire ram, making it smoke on the altar.

Twenty geʹrahs  equal a shekel. A half shekel is the contribution to Jehovah.","Everyone registered who is 20 years old and up will give Jehovah’s contribution.","The rich should not give more and the poor should not give less than the half shekel  as a contribution to Jehovah to make atonement for your lives.","You are to take the silver money of the atonement from the Israelites and give it in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting, that it may serve as a remembrance before Jehovah for the Israelites, to make atonement for your lives.”","Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:","“Make a copper basin and its stand for washing; then place it between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water into it.","Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet there.","When they go into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to minister and to make offerings of fire and smoke to Jehovah, they will wash with water so that they do not die.","They must wash their hands  and their feet so that they may not die, and it must serve as a permanent regulation for them, for him and his offspring, throughout their generations.”","Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:","“Next, take the choicest perfumes: 500 units of solidified myrrh, and half that amount, 250 units, of sweet cinnamon, 250 units of sweet calamus,","and 500 units of cassia, measured by the standard shekel of the holy place,  along with a hin  of olive oil.","Then make out of it a holy anointing oil; it should be skillfully blended together.  It is to be a holy anointing oil.","“You are to anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the Testimony with it,","as well as the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,","the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand.","You must sanctify them that they may become most holy. Anyone touching them is to be holy.","And you will anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them to serve as priests to me.","“You will speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘This is to continue as a holy anointing oil to me during your generations.","It is not to be applied to the flesh of mankind, and you must not make anything with a composition like it. It is something holy. It is to continue as something holy for you.","Anyone who makes an ointment like it and who puts some of it on an unauthorized person  must be cut off  from his people.’”","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Take equal portions of these perfumes: stacte drops, onycha, perfumed galbanum, and pure frankincense.","Make it into an incense; the spice mixture should be skillfully blended,  salted, pure, and holy.","You are to pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will present myself to you. It should be most holy to you.","You must not make for your own use the incense that you make with this composition. You are to regard it as something holy to Jehovah.","Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off  from his people.”"],["Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying:","“See, I have chosen  Bezʹal·el the son of Uʹri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.","I will fill him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of every kind of craftsmanship,","for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper,","for cutting and setting stones, and for making every kind of wood product.","Moreover, to assist him I have appointed O·hoʹli·ab the son of A·hisʹa·mach of the tribe of Dan, and I am putting wisdom into the heart of all those who are skillful,  so that they may make everything I have commanded you:","the tent of meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the cover that is on it, all the equipment of the tent,","the table and its utensils, the lampstand of pure gold and all its utensils, the altar of incense,","the altar of burnt offering and all its  utensils, the basin and its stand,","the finely woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to serve as priests,","the anointing oil, and the perfumed incense for the sanctuary. They will do everything I have commanded you.”","Jehovah said further to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘Especially, you are to keep my sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you during your generations in order that you may know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you.","You must keep the Sabbath, for it is something holy to you. Whoever profanes it must be put to death. If anyone does any work on it, then that person  must be cut off  from among his people.","Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest. It is something holy to Jehovah. Anyone doing work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.","The Israelites must keep the Sabbath; they must observe the Sabbath during all their generations. It is a lasting covenant.","It is an enduring sign between me and the people of Israel, for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and refreshed himself.’”","Now as soon as he had finished speaking with him on Mount Siʹnai, he gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone written on by God’s finger."],["Meanwhile, the people saw that Moses was taking a long time coming down from the mountain. So the people gathered around Aaron and said to him: “Get up, make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt.”","At this Aaron said to them: “Take the gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to me.”","So all the people began taking off the gold earrings that were in their ears and bringing them to Aaron.","Then he took the gold from them, and he formed it with an engraving tool and made it into a statue  of a calf. They began to say: “This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.”","When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. Then Aaron called out: “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.”","So they got up early on the next day and began offering up burnt offerings and presenting communion sacrifices. After that the people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to have a good time.","Jehovah now said to Moses: “Go, descend, because your people, whom you led up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.","They have quickly deviated from the way I commanded them to go. They have made for themselves a statue  of a calf, and they keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying, ‘This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.’”","Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “I have seen that this is an obstinate  people.","So now let me be, and I will exterminate them in my burning anger, and let me make a great nation from you instead.”","Then Moses appealed to  Jehovah his God and said: “Why,  O Jehovah, should you turn your burning anger against your people after bringing them out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?","Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He had evil intentions when he led them out. He wanted to kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the surface of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and reconsider  your decision to bring this calamity on your people.","Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by yourself and said: ‘I will multiply your offspring  like the stars of the heavens, and I will give all this land that I have designated to your offspring,  so that they may take it as a permanent possession.’”","So Jehovah began to reconsider  the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on his people.","Moses then turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand. The tablets were inscribed on both sides; they were written on the front and on the back.","The tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets.","When Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting, he said to Moses: “There is the sound of battle in the camp.”","But Moses said:","As soon as Moses got near the camp and saw the calf and the dances, his anger began to blaze, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.","He took the calf that they had made and he burned it with fire and crushed it into powder; then he scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.","And Moses said to Aaron: “What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?”","Aaron replied: “Do not be enraged, my lord. You well know that the people are inclined to do evil.","So they said to me, ‘Make for us a god who will go ahead of us, for we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt.’","So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold must take it off and give it to me.’ Then I threw it into the fire and out came this calf.”","Moses saw that the people were unrestrained, for Aaron had let them go unrestrained, so that they were a disgrace before their opposers.","Then Moses took his position in the gate of the camp and said: “Who is on Jehovah’s side? Come to me!” And all the Levites gathered around him.","He now said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Each of you must fasten on his sword and pass through all the camp from gate to gate, killing his brother, his neighbor, and his close companion.’”","The Levites did what Moses said. So about 3,000 men were killed on that day.","Then Moses said: “Set yourselves apart  for Jehovah today, for each of you has gone against his own son and his own brother; today he will give you a blessing.”","On the very next day, Moses said to the people: “You committed a very great sin, and now I will go up to Jehovah to see if I can make amends for your sin.”","So Moses returned to Jehovah and said: “What a great sin this people has committed! They made themselves a god of gold!","But now if you are willing, pardon their sin; if not, please wipe me out from your book that you have written.”","However, Jehovah said to Moses: “Whoever has sinned against me, I will wipe him out of my book.","Go now, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Look! My angel will go ahead of you, and on the day when I make an accounting, I will bring punishment on them for their sin.”","Then Jehovah began plaguing the people because they had made the calf, the one that Aaron had made."],["Jehovah said further to Moses: “Go on your way from here with the people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt. Journey to the land about which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring  I will give it.’","I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Caʹnaan·ites, the Amʹor·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites.","Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go in the midst of you, for you are an obstinate  people, and I might exterminate you on the way.”","When the people heard this harsh word, they began to mourn, and not one of them put on his ornaments.","Jehovah said to Moses: “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are an obstinate  people. In one moment I could go through the midst of you and exterminate you. So now keep your ornaments off while I consider what to do to you.’”","So from Mount Horʹeb onward, the Israelites refrained from wearing  their ornaments.","Now Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, at some distance from the camp, and he called it a tent of meeting. Everyone inquiring of Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.","As soon as Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents, and they would gaze after Moses until he entered into the tent.","As soon as Moses would go into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of the tent while God spoke with Moses.","When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, each of them rose and bowed down at the entrance of his own tent.","Jehovah spoke to Moses face-to-face, just as one man would speak to another man. When he returned to the camp, Joshua the son of Nun, his minister and attendant, would not depart from the tent.","Now Moses said to Jehovah: “See, you are saying to me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Moreover, you have said, ‘I know you by name,  and you have also found favor in my eyes.’","Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, make me know your ways, so that I may know you and continue to find favor in your eyes. Consider, too, that this nation is your people.”","So he said: “I myself   will go with you, and I will give you rest.”","Then Moses said to him: “If you yourself are  not going along, do not lead us up from here.","How will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going along with us, so that I and your people will be distinguished from every other people on the face of the earth?”","Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “I will also do this thing that you request, because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by name.”","Then he said: “Please show me your glory.”","But he said: “I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will declare before you the name of Jehovah; and I will favor the one whom I favor, and I will show mercy to the one to whom I show mercy.”","But he added: “You cannot see my face, for no man can see me and live.”","Jehovah said further: “Here is a place near me. Station yourself on the rock.","When my glory is passing by, I will place you in a crevice of the rock, and I will shield you with my hand until I have passed by.","After that I will take my hand away, and you will see my back. But my face may not be seen.”"],["Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets, which you shattered.","Get ready for the morning, as you will go up in the morning to Mount Siʹnai and station yourself before me there on the top of the mountain.","But nobody may go up with you, and nobody else should be seen anywhere on the mountain. Not even the flocks or herds should graze in front of that mountain.”","So Moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went up Mount Siʹnai, just as Jehovah had commanded him, and he took the two tablets of stone in his hand.","Then Jehovah came down in the cloud and stationed himself with him there and declared the name of Jehovah.","Jehovah was passing before him and declaring: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate,  slow to anger and abundant in loyal love  and truth,","showing loyal love to thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.”","Moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself.","Then he said: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, O Jehovah, then please, Jehovah, go along with us in our midst, although we are an obstinate  people, and forgive our error and our sin, and take us as your own possession.”","In turn he said: “Here I am making a covenant: Before all your people, I will do wonderful things that have never been done  in all the earth or among all the nations, and all the people among whom you live will see the work of Jehovah, for it is an awe-inspiring thing that I am doing with you.","“Pay attention to what I am commanding you today. Here I  am driving out from before you the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites.","Be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it may prove to be a snare among you.","But you are to pull down their altars, you are to shatter their sacred pillars, and their sacred poles  you are to cut down.","You must not bow down to another god, for Jehovah is known for  requiring exclusive devotion.  Yes, he is a God who requires exclusive devotion.","Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice.","Then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods.","“You must not make gods of cast metal.","“You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You will eat unleavened bread, just as I have commanded you; do this for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Aʹbib,  because it was in the month of Aʹbib that you came out of Egypt.","“Every firstborn male  is mine, including all your livestock, whether the first male bull or sheep.","The firstling of a donkey you are to redeem with a sheep. But if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. You are to redeem every firstborn of your sons. No one may appear before me empty-handed.","“Six days you are to work, but on the seventh day you will rest.  Even during plowing time and in harvest, you will rest.","“And you will celebrate your Festival of Weeks with the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering  at the turn of the year.","“Three times a year, all your men  are to appear before the true Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel.","For I will drive the nations away from before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times a year.","“You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice along with anything leavened. The sacrifice of the festival of the Passover should not be kept overnight until the morning.","“The best of the first ripe fruits of your soil you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God.","Jehovah went on to say to Moses: “You are to write down these words, because in accordance with these words, I am making a covenant with you and with Israel.”","And he remained there with Jehovah 40 days and 40 nights. He ate no bread and drank no water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.","Moses then came down from Mount Siʹnai, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. When he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face was emitting rays because he had been speaking with God.","When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, they noticed that the skin of his face emitted rays and they were afraid to go near him.","But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him, and Moses spoke with them.","After that all the Israelites came near to him, and he gave them all the commands that Jehovah had given him on Mount Siʹnai.","When Moses would finish speaking with them, he would put a veil over his face.","But when Moses would go in before Jehovah to speak with him, he would take off the veil until he went out. Then he went out and revealed to the Israelites the commands he had received.","And the Israelites saw that the skin of Moses’ face emitted rays; then Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with God."],["Moses later gathered the entire assembly of the Israelites together and said to them: “These are the things that Jehovah has commanded to be done:","Work may be done for six days, but the seventh day will become something holy to you, a sabbath of complete rest to Jehovah. Anybody doing work on it will be put to death.","You must not light a fire in any of your dwelling places on the Sabbath day.”","Moses then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites: “This is what Jehovah has commanded,","‘Take up a contribution for Jehovah from among yourselves.

The tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived.","Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Eʹphra·im departed by their companies,  and E·lishʹa·ma the son of Am·miʹhud was over its company.","Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh was Ga·maʹli·el the son of Pe·dahʹzur.","Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abʹi·dan the son of Gid·e·oʹni.","Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Dan departed by their companies,  forming the rear guard for all the camps, and A·hi·eʹzer the son of Am·mi·shadʹdai was over its company.","Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ashʹer was Paʹgi·el the son of Ochʹran.","Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Naphʹta·li was A·hiʹra the son of Eʹnan.","This was the order of departure that the Israelites and their companies  followed when they would depart.","Then Moses said to Hoʹbab the son of Reuʹel  the Midʹi·an·ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are setting out for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Do come with us, and we will treat you well, because Jehovah has promised good things for Israel.”","But he said to him: “I will not go. I will return to my own country and to my relatives.”","At this he said: “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide.","And if you do come with us, whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us, we will surely show to you.”","So they began marching from the mountain of Jehovah for a journey of three days, and the ark of Jehovah’s covenant traveled before them for the three-day journey to search out a resting-place for them.","And Jehovah’s cloud was over them by day when they set out from the encampment.","Whenever the Ark was moved, Moses would say: “Rise up, O Jehovah, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee from before you.”","And when it would rest, he would say: “Do return, O Jehovah, to the countless  thousands of Israel.”"],["Now the people began to complain bitterly before Jehovah. When Jehovah heard it, his anger flared, and a fire from Jehovah began to blaze against them and to consume some on the outskirts of the camp.","When the people  began to cry out to Moses, he made supplication to Jehovah, and the fire died out.","So that place was given the name Tabʹe·rah,  because a fire from Jehovah had blazed against them.","The mixed crowd  who were in their midst then expressed selfish longing, and the Israelites too began to weep again and say: “Who will give us meat to eat?","How fondly we remember the fish that we used to eat without cost in Egypt, also the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic!","But now we  are withering away. We see nothing at all except this manna.”","Incidentally, the manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium gum.","The people would spread out and pick it up and grind it in hand mills or pound it in a mortar. Then they would boil it in cooking pots or make it into round loaves, and it tasted like an oiled sweet cake.","When the dew descended on the camp by night, the manna would also descend on it.","Moses heard the people weeping, family after family, each man at the entrance of his tent. And Jehovah became very angry, and Moses was also very displeased.","Then Moses said to Jehovah: “Why have you afflicted your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, so that you put the burden of all this people on me?","Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, so that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, just as an attendant  carries the nursing child,’ to the land that you swore to give to their forefathers?","From where will I get meat to give to all this people? For they keep weeping before me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’","I am not able to bear all this people by myself; it is too much for me.","If this is how you are going to treat me, please kill me right now. If I have found favor in your eyes, do not make me see any more calamity.”","Jehovah replied to Moses: “Gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel, men whom you recognize as  elders and officials of the people, and take them to the tent of meeting, and have them stand there with you.","I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take away some of the spirit that is on you and place it on them, and they will help you in bearing the burden of the people so that you may not have to bear it alone.","You should say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for you will certainly eat meat, because you have wept in Jehovah’s hearing and have said: “Who will give us meat to eat? It was better for us in Egypt.” Jehovah will certainly give you meat, and you will eat.","You will eat, not one day nor 2 days nor 5 days nor 10 days nor 20 days,","but for a whole month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and it has become loathsome to you, for you rejected Jehovah, who is in your midst, and you were weeping before him, saying: “Why is it that we have come out of Egypt?”’”","Then Moses said: “The people I am among number 600,000 men on foot, and yet you yourself have said, ‘Meat I will give them, and they will eat  enough for a whole month of days’!","If whole flocks and herds were slaughtered, would it be enough for them? Or if all the fish of the sea were caught, would it be enough for them?”","Jehovah then said to Moses: “Is the hand of Jehovah too short? Now you will see whether what I say will happen to you or not.”","So Moses went out and spoke the words of Jehovah to the people. And he gathered 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.","Then Jehovah came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was on him and put it on each of the 70 elders. And as soon as the spirit settled down on them, they began to behave as prophets,  but they did not do it again.","There were two of the men still in the camp. Their names were Elʹdad and Meʹdad. And the spirit began to settle down on them, as they were among those whose names had been written down, but they had not gone out to the tent. So they began to behave as prophets in the camp.","And a young man ran and reported to Moses: “Elʹdad and Meʹdad are behaving as prophets in the camp!”","Then Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth, responded and said: “My lord Moses, restrain them!”","But Moses said to him: “Are you jealous for me? No, I wish that all of Jehovah’s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them!”","Later Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.","Then a wind from Jehovah sprang up and began driving quail from the sea and causing them to fall around the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and they were about two cubits  deep on the ground.","So all that day and all night and all the next day, the people stayed up and gathered the quail. No one gathered less than ten hoʹmers,  and they kept spreading them all around the camp for themselves.","But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it could be chewed, Jehovah’s anger blazed against the people, and Jehovah began striking the people with a very great slaughter.","So they gave that place the name Kibʹroth-hat·taʹa·vah,  because there they buried the people who showed selfish craving.","From Kibʹroth-hat·taʹa·vah the people departed for Ha·zeʹroth, and they remained at Ha·zeʹroth."],["Now Mirʹi·am and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushʹite wife he had married, for he had taken a Cushʹite wife.","They were saying: “Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken? Has he not also spoken through us?” And Jehovah was listening.","Now the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men  on the face of the earth.","Jehovah suddenly said to Moses and Aaron and Mirʹi·am: “Go out, the three of you, to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out.","And Jehovah came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the  tent and called Aaron and Mirʹi·am. Both of them went forward.","He then said: “Hear my words, please. If there was a prophet of Jehovah among you, I would make myself known to him in a vision, and I would speak to him in a dream.","But it is not that way with my servant Moses! He is being entrusted with all my house.","Face-to-face  I speak to him, openly, not by riddles; and the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees. Why, then, did you not fear to speak against my servant, against Moses?”","So Jehovah’s anger burned against them, and he departed from them.","The cloud moved away from over the tent, and look! Mirʹi·am was struck with leprosy as white as snow. Then Aaron turned toward Mirʹi·am, and he saw that she was struck with leprosy.","Immediately Aaron said to Moses: “I beg you, my lord! Please do not hold this sin against us! We have acted foolishly in what we have done.","Please, do not let her continue like someone dead, whose flesh is half eaten away at birth!”","And Moses began to cry out to Jehovah, saying: “O God, please heal her! Please!”","Jehovah replied to Moses: “If her father would spit directly in her face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? Let her be quarantined for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be brought back in.”","So Mirʹi·am was quarantined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not break camp until Mirʹi·am was brought back in.","Then the people departed from Ha·zeʹroth and began camping in the wilderness of Paʹran."],["Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying:","“Send out men to spy  out the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. You are to send out one man from each ancestral tribe, each one a chieftain among them.”","So Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paʹran at the order of Jehovah. All the men were heads of the Israelites.","These are their names: of the tribe of Reuʹben, Sham·muʹa the son of Zacʹcur;","of the tribe of Simʹe·on, Shaʹphat the son of Hoʹri;","of the tribe of Judah, Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh;","of the tribe of Isʹsa·char, Iʹgal the son of Joseph;","of the tribe of Eʹphra·im, Ho·sheʹa the son of Nun;","of the tribe of Benjamin, Palʹti the son of Raʹphu;","of the tribe of Zebʹu·lun, Gadʹdi·el the son of Soʹdi;","of the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh, Gadʹdi the son of Suʹsi;","of the tribe of Dan, Amʹmi·el the son of Ge·malʹli;","of the tribe of Ashʹer, Seʹthur the son of Miʹcha·el;","of the tribe of Naphʹta·li, Nahʹbi the son of Vophʹsi;","of the tribe of Gad, Geuʹel the son of Maʹchi.","These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses gave the name Joshua  to Ho·sheʹa the son of Nun.","When Moses was sending them to spy out the land of Caʹnaan, he said to them: “Go up there into the Negʹeb, and then go up into the mountainous region.","You must see what kind of land it is and whether the people who are dwelling in it are strong or weak, few or many,","and whether the land is good or bad and whether the cities they are dwelling in are encampments or fortifications.","And find out whether the land is rich  or poor  and whether there are trees in it or not. You must be courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land.” Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes.","So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Reʹhob, near Leʹbo-haʹmath.","When they went up into the Negʹeb, they came to Hebʹron, where A·hiʹman, Sheʹshai, and Talʹmai, the Anʹa·kim, were living. Incidentally, Hebʹron had been built seven years before Zoʹan of Egypt.","When they came to the Valley  of Eshʹcol, there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes, which two of the men had to carry on a bar, as well as some of the pomegranates and figs.","They called that place the Valley  of Eshʹcol  because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there.","At the end of 40 days, they returned from spying out the land.","So they came back to Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paʹran, at Kaʹdesh. They brought back a report to all the assembly and showed them the fruitage of the land.","This is what they reported to Moses: “We entered the land into which you sent us, and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruitage.","Nevertheless, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the fortified cities are very great. We also saw the Anʹa·kim there.","The A·malʹek·ites are dwelling in the land of the Negʹeb, and the Hitʹtites, the Jebʹu·sites, and the Amʹor·ites are dwelling in the mountainous region, and the Caʹnaan·ites are dwelling by the sea and along the Jordan.”","Then Caʹleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying: “Let us go up immediately, and we are sure to take possession of it, because we can surely conquer it.”","But the men who went up with him said: “We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.”","And they kept on giving the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out, saying: “The land that we passed through to spy out is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary size.","And there we saw the Nephʹi·lim, the sons of Aʹnak, who are from  the Nephʹi·lim, and in comparison we seemed like grasshoppers, both to us and to them.”"],["Then all the assembly raised their voice, and the people continued crying out and weeping all through that night.","All the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly spoke against them, saying: “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!","Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?”","They were even saying to one another: “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt!”","At this Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground before the whole assembled congregation of the Israelites.","Joshua the son of Nun and Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh, who were among those who spied out the land, ripped their garments apart,","and they said this to all the assembly of the Israelites: “The land that we passed through to spy out is a very, very good land.","If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey.","But you must not rebel against Jehovah, and you must not fear the people of the land, for we will devour them.  Their protection has been removed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.”","However, all the assembly talked of stoning them. But Jehovah’s glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “How much longer will this people treat me without respect, and how much longer will they not put faith in me in spite of all the signs that I performed among them?","Let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away, and let me make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.”","But Moses said to Jehovah: “Then the Egyptians, from whose midst you brought this people out by your power, will hear,","and they will speak about it to the inhabitants of this land. These also have heard that you, Jehovah, are among this people and have appeared to them face-to-face. You are Jehovah, and your cloud is standing over them, and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night.","If you put this people to death all at once,  the nations who have heard of your fame would say this:","‘Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’","Please, now, Jehovah, let your power be great, as you promised when you said:","‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love,  pardoning error and transgression, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.’","Forgive, please, the error of this people according to your great loyal love, just as you have pardoned this people from Egypt until now.”","Then Jehovah said: “I forgive them according to your word.","But on the other hand, as surely as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah.","However, not one of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness and yet have kept testing me these ten times and have not listened to my voice","will ever see the land about which I swore to their fathers. No, not one of those treating me without respect will see it.","But because my servant Caʹleb had a different spirit and kept following after me wholeheartedly, I will certainly bring him into the land where he went, and his offspring will take possession of it.","Since the A·malʹek·ites and  the Caʹnaan·ites are dwelling in the valley,  you should turn back tomorrow and set off for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”","Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron:","“How much longer will this evil assembly keep up this murmuring against me? I have heard what the Israelites are murmuring against me.","Say to them, ‘“As surely as I live,” declares Jehovah, “I will do to you just what I have heard you speak!","In this wilderness your corpses will fall, yes, the whole number of you from 20 years old and up who were registered, all of you who have murmured against me.","None of you will enter into the land that I swore  to have you reside in except Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh and Joshua the son of Nun.","“‘“And I will bring in your children, who you said would become plunder, and they will get to know the land that you have rejected.","But your own corpses will fall in this wilderness.","Now your sons will become shepherds in the wilderness 40 years, and they will have to answer for your acts of unfaithfulness  until the last one of your corpses falls in the wilderness.","According to the number of the days that you spied out the land, 40 days, a day for a year, a day for a year, you will answer for your errors 40 years, for you will know what it means to oppose me.","“‘“I, Jehovah, have spoken. This is what I will do to all this evil assembly, those who have gathered together against me: In this wilderness they will come to their end, and here they will die.","The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who caused the whole assembly to murmur against him when they returned with a bad report about the land,","yes, the men who brought back the bad report about the land will be struck down and die before Jehovah.","But Joshua the son of Nun and Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh, who were among those who went to spy out the land, will certainly keep living.”’”","When Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people began to mourn a great deal.","Moreover, they got up early in the morning and tried to go up to the top of the mountain, saying: “Here we are ready to go up to the place that Jehovah spoke about, for we have sinned.”","But Moses said: “Why are you going beyond the order of Jehovah? This will not succeed.","Do not go up, for Jehovah is not with you; and you will be defeated by your enemies.","For the A·malʹek·ites and the Caʹnaan·ites are there to face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you turned away from following Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.”","However, they presumptuously went toward the top of the mountain, but the ark of Jehovah’s covenant and Moses did not move away from the middle of the camp.","Then the A·malʹek·ites and the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in that mountain came down and struck them, scattering them as far as Horʹmah."],["Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying:","“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you to dwell in","and you make  an offering by fire to Jehovah from the herd or from the flock—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or a voluntary offering or an offering during your seasonal festivals, in order to make a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah—","the one presenting his offering must also present to Jehovah a grain offering of fine flour, a tenth of an eʹphah,  mixed with a fourth of a hin  of oil.","You should also offer wine as a drink offering, a fourth of a hin, together with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice of each male lamb.","Or for a ram, you should make a grain offering of two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.","And you should present wine as a drink offering, a third of a hin, as a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah.","“‘But if you should offer a male of the herd as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or communion sacrifices to Jehovah,","you should also present together with the male of the herd a grain offering of three tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.","You should also present wine as a drink offering, half a hin, as an offering made by fire, as a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah.","This is what should be done for each bull or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or of the goats.","Whatever may be the number that you offer, that is what you should do for each one, according to their number.","This is how every native-born Israelite should present an offering made by fire, as a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah.","“‘If a foreigner who is residing with you or one who has been in your midst for many of your generations should also make an offering by fire, as a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah, he should do just as you do.","You who are of the congregation and the foreigner who is residing with you will have one statute. It will be a lasting statute for all your generations. The foreign resident should be the same as you before Jehovah.","There should be one law and one judicial decision for you and for the foreigner who is residing with you.’”","Jehovah went on to say to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I am bringing you","and you eat any of the bread  of the land, you should make a contribution to Jehovah.","You should make a contribution of the firstfruits of your coarse meal as ring-shaped loaves. Like the contribution of a threshing floor is the way you should contribute it.","Some of the firstfruits of your coarse meal you should give as a contribution to Jehovah throughout your generations.","“‘Now if you make a mistake and fail to observe all these commandments that Jehovah has spoken to Moses,","all that Jehovah has commanded you through Moses from the day that Jehovah commanded and onward for your generations,","and if it was done by mistake and without the knowledge of the assembly, the whole assembly must offer one young bull as a burnt offering for a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah, together with  its grain offering and its drink offering according to the regular procedure, and one young goat as a sin offering.","The priest will make atonement for the whole assembly of the Israelites, and it will be forgiven them, because it was a mistake, and they brought as their offering an offering made by fire to Jehovah and their sin offering before Jehovah for their mistake.","It will be forgiven the whole assembly of the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, because it was by mistake on the part of all the people.","“‘If any person  should sin by mistake, then he must present a female goat in its first year for a sin offering.","And the priest will make atonement for the person  who made a mistake by an unintentional sin before Jehovah, so as to make atonement for it, and it will be forgiven him.","As for the native-born among the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, there should be one law for you in the matter of doing something unintentionally.","“‘But the person  who does something deliberately, whether he is native-born or a foreign resident, is blaspheming Jehovah and must be cut off  from among his people.","Because he has despised Jehovah’s word and broken his commandment, that person  should be cut off without fail. His own error is upon him.’”","While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man collecting pieces of wood on the Sabbath day.","Those who found him collecting wood brought him up to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly.","They committed him into custody because it had not been specified what should be done to him.","And Jehovah said to Moses: “The man should be put to death without fail, and the whole assembly should stone him outside the camp.”","So the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him so that he died, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.","Jehovah went on to say this to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that they must make for themselves fringed edges on the skirts of their garments throughout their generations, and they are to put a blue string above the fringed edge of the skirt.","‘You must have this fringed edge so that you will see it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and observe them. You must not follow your own hearts and eyes, which are leading you to spiritual prostitution.","This will help you remember, and you will observe all my commandments and be holy to your God.","I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to prove myself your God. I am Jehovah your God.’”"],["Then Korʹah the son of Izʹhar, the son of Koʹhath, the son of Leʹvi, got up together with Daʹthan and A·biʹram the sons of E·liʹab, and On the son of Peʹleth, of the sons of Reuʹben.","They rose up against Moses along with 250 Israelite men, chieftains of the assembly, chosen ones of the congregation, prominent men.","So they gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them: “We have had enough of you! The whole assembly is holy, all of them, and Jehovah is in their  midst. Why, then, should you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?”","When Moses heard this, he at once fell facedown.","Then he said to Korʹah and to all his supporters: “In the morning Jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who should approach him, and whomever he may choose will approach him.","Do this: Take fire holders, Korʹah and all your supporters,","and put fire in them and place incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow, and the man whom Jehovah will choose, he is the holy one. You sons of Leʹvi have gone far enough!”","Moses then said to Korʹah: “Listen, please, you sons of Leʹvi.","Does it seem to you such a little thing that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel and allowed you to approach him in order to perform the service of Jehovah’s tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them,","and that he brought you near to him along with all your brothers, the sons of Leʹvi? Must you also try to secure the priesthood?","For this reason, you and all your supporters who are gathering together are against Jehovah. As for Aaron, who is he that you should murmur against him?”","Moses later sent for Daʹthan and A·biʹram the sons of E·liʹab, but they said: “We are not going to come!","Is it so little a thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness? Now do you also want to make yourself an absolute ruler over us?","As it is, you have not brought us into any land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of field and vineyard. Would you bore out the eyes of those men? We are not going to come!”","So Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah: “Do not turn to look at their grain offering. Not one donkey have I taken away from them, nor have I harmed one of them.”","Then Moses said to Korʹah: “Present yourself with all your supporters before Jehovah tomorrow, you and they and Aaron.","Each one should take his fire holder and put incense on it, and each will present his fire holder before Jehovah, 250 fire holders, together with you and Aaron, each with his fire holder.”","So each of them took his fire holder, and they put fire and incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting together with Moses and Aaron.","When Korʹah had gathered his supporters against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the assembly.","Jehovah now told Moses and Aaron:","“Separate yourselves from among this group, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.”","At this, they fell with their faces to the ground and said: “O God, the God of the spirit of all people,  will one man’s sin cause you to become indignant against the entire assembly?”","Jehovah then said to Moses:","“Speak to the assembly and tell them, ‘Get away from around the tents of Korʹah, Daʹthan, and A·biʹram!’”","Then Moses got up and went to Daʹthan and A·biʹram, and the elders of Israel went with him.","He told the  assembly: “Move away, please, from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, so that you may not be swept away in all their sin.”","They immediately moved away from the tents of Korʹah, Daʹthan, and A·biʹram, from every side, and Daʹthan and A·biʹram came out, taking their stand at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little children.","Then Moses said: “By this you will know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these things, that it is not of my own heart:","If these people die a natural death as all men do and if their punishment is the same as that of all mankind, then Jehovah has not sent me.","But if Jehovah does something extraordinary with them and the ground opens  and swallows them and everything that belongs to them and they go down alive into the Grave,  you will certainly know that these men have treated Jehovah disrespectfully.”","As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground beneath them split apart.","And the earth opened  and swallowed them up, along with their households and everyone who belonged to Korʹah and all their goods.","So they and all who belonged to them went down alive into the Grave,  and the earth covered them over, so that they perished from the midst of the congregation.","All the Israelites who were around them fled at their screaming, for they said: “We are afraid that the earth may swallow us up!”","Then a fire came out from Jehovah and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.","Jehovah now said to Moses:","“Tell El·e·aʹzar the son of Aaron the priest to take the fire holders out of the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the fire some distance away.","The fire holders of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives  should be made into thin metal plates to overlay the altar, because they presented them before Jehovah, and they became holy. They should serve as a sign to the Israelites.”","So El·e·aʹzar the priest took the copper fire holders that had been presented by those who were burned up, and beat them to overlay the altar,","just as Jehovah had told him through Moses. It was a reminder for the Israelites that no unauthorized person  who is not of the offspring of Aaron should approach to burn incense before Jehovah and that no one should become like Korʹah and his supporters.","On the very next day, the whole assembly of the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, saying: “You two have put Jehovah’s people to death.”","When the assembly had gathered together against Moses and Aaron, they then turned toward the tent of meeting, and look! the cloud covered it, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear.","Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting,","and Jehovah said to Moses:","“You men, remove yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.” At this  they fell with their faces to the ground.","Moses then said to Aaron: “Take the fire holder and put fire from the altar in it and put incense on it and go quickly to the assembly and make atonement for them, because indignation has gone out from Jehovah. The plague has started!”","Aaron at once took it, just as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation, and look! the plague had started among the people. So he put the incense on the fire holder and began making atonement for the people.","He kept standing between the dead and the living, and the scourge eventually stopped.","Those who died from the scourge amounted to 14,700, besides those dead on account of Korʹah.","When at last Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the scourge had been stopped."],["Jehovah now said to Moses:","“Speak to the Israelites and take from them one rod for each paternal house, from the chieftains of each paternal house, 12 rods in all. Write the name of each one on his rod.","You should write Aaron’s name on Leʹvi’s rod, because there is one rod for the head of each paternal house.","Deposit the rods in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I regularly present myself to you.","And the rod of the man whom I choose will bud, and I will put a stop to the murmuring of the Israelites against me, which they are also murmuring against you.”","So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their chieftains gave him rods—a rod for each chieftain of a paternal house, 12 rods—and Aaron’s rod was among their rods.","Then Moses deposited the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the Testimony.","On the next day, when Moses went into the tent of the Testimony, look! Aaron’s rod for the house of Leʹvi had budded and was bringing forth buds and blossoming flowers and bearing ripe almonds.","Moses then brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the people of Israel. They looked at them, and each man took his own rod.","Jehovah then said to Moses: “Put Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony as something to be kept for a sign to the sons of rebelliousness, so that their murmurings against me may cease and so that they may not die.”","Moses immediately did just as Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.","The Israelites then said to Moses: “Now we will die, we will surely perish, we are all going to perish!","Anyone who even comes close to Jehovah’s tabernacle will die! Must we end up dying that way?”"],["Jehovah then said to Aaron: “You and your sons and your paternal house with you will be answerable for any error against the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will be answerable for any error against your priesthood.","Also bring near your brothers of the tribe of Leʹvi, your ancestral tribe, so that they may join you and minister to you and your sons before the tent of the Testimony.","They are to fulfill their responsibilities to you and to the entire tent. However, they must not come near the utensils of the holy place and the altar, so that neither they nor you may die.","They will join you and carry out their responsibilities regarding the tent of meeting and all the service of the tent,  and no unauthorized person  may come near to you.","You must carry out your responsibility toward the holy place and the altar, so that no further indignation may come against the people of Israel.","I myself have taken your brothers, the Levites, from among the Israelites as a gift for you. They are given to Jehovah to care for the service of the tent of meeting.","You and your sons are responsible for your priestly duties pertaining to the altar and what is inside the curtain, and you are to render this service. I have given the service of the priesthood as a gift to you, and any unauthorized person  who approaches should be put to death.”","Jehovah spoke further to Aaron: “I myself put you in charge of the contributions made to me. I have given to you and to your sons a portion of all the holy things contributed by the Israelites as a permanent allowance.","This will be yours out of the most holy offerings made by fire: every offering they make, including their grain offerings and their sin offerings and their guilt offerings that they bring to me. It is something most holy for you and for your sons.","In a most holy place you should eat it. Every male may eat it. It will be something holy to you.","This also belongs to you: the gifts they contribute together with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.","“All the best of the oil and all the best of the new wine and the grain, their firstfruits, which they give to Jehovah, I give them to you.","The first ripe fruits of everything from their land, which they will bring to Jehovah, will become yours. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.","“Every devoted thing  in Israel should become yours.","“Every firstborn of all living things,  which they will present to Jehovah, whether man or animal, should become yours. However, you should without fail redeem the firstborn of mankind, and the firstborn of the unclean animals you should redeem.","You should redeem it with the redemption price when it is a month old and up, by the estimated value of five silver shekels,  according to the standard shekel of the holy place.  It is 20 geʹrahs.","Only the firstborn bull or firstborn male lamb or firstborn goat you should not redeem. They are something holy. You should sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat you should make smoke as an offering made by fire for a pleasing  aroma to Jehovah.","And their flesh should become yours. Like the breast of the wave offering and like the right leg, it should become yours.","All the holy contributions that the Israelites will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance. It is a  lasting covenant of salt  before Jehovah for you and your offspring with you.”","Jehovah went on to say to Aaron: “In their land you will not have an inheritance, and no portion of land among them will become yours. I am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the Israelites.","“Now see that I have given to the sons of Leʹvi every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance in return for the service they are carrying out, the service of the tent of meeting.","No longer may the people of Israel approach the tent of meeting, or else they will incur sin and die.","The Levites themselves are to carry out the service of the tent of meeting, and they are the ones who will answer for their error. It is a lasting statute during all your generations that they should not take possession of an inheritance among the Israelites.","For I have given to the Levites as an inheritance the tenth part contributed by the people of Israel, which they will contribute to Jehovah. That is why I have said to them, ‘In the midst of the Israelites, they should not take possession of an inheritance.’”","Then Jehovah said to Moses:","“You should tell the Levites, ‘You will receive from the Israelites the tenth part that I have given to you from them for your inheritance, and you should contribute from it a tenth part of the tenth part as a contribution to Jehovah.","And it will be considered your contribution, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or the full production of the winepress or oil press.","In this way you will also give a contribution to Jehovah from all the tenth parts that you receive from the Israelites, and from them you are to give the contribution for Jehovah to Aaron the priest.","You will make every sort of contribution to Jehovah from the very best of all the gifts given to you as something holy.’","“And you must say to them, ‘When you contribute the best of them, then it will be considered for the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress or oil press.","You and your household may eat it in any place, because it is your wages in return for your service at the tent of meeting.","You will not incur sin in this as long as you contribute the best from them, and you must not profane the holy things of the Israelites, or you will die.’”"],["Jehovah spoke again to Moses and Aaron, saying:","“This is a statute of the law that Jehovah has commanded, ‘Tell the Israelites that they should take for you a sound red cow in which there is no defect and upon which no yoke has come.","You are to give it to El·e·aʹzar the priest, and he will lead it outside the camp, and it will be slaughtered before him.","Then El·e·aʹzar the priest will take some of its blood with his finger and spatter its blood seven times straight toward the front of the tent of meeting.","The cow will then be burned before his eyes. Its skin and its flesh and its blood together with its dung will be burned.","And the priest will take cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet material and throw them into the fire where the cow is being burned.","The priest will then wash his garments and bathe himself  in  water, and afterward he may come into the camp; but the priest will be unclean until the evening.","“‘The one who burned the cow will wash his garments in water and bathe himself  in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.","“‘A clean man will gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and they should be kept by the assembly of the Israelites to prepare water that will be used for cleansing. It is a sin offering.","The one gathering the ashes of the cow will wash his garments and be unclean until the evening.","Anyone touching any dead person  will be unclean for seven days.","Such one should purify himself with the water  on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day, on the seventh day he will not be clean.","Everyone who touches the corpse of any dead person  and does not purify himself has defiled Jehovah’s tabernacle, and that person  must be cut off  from Israel. Because the water for cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he continues unclean. His uncleanness remains upon him.","“‘This is the law that applies when a man dies in a tent: Everyone who enters the tent and everyone who was already in the tent will be unclean for seven days.","Every opened container with no lid tied on it is unclean.","Everyone in the open field who touches someone killed with the sword or a corpse or the bone of a man or a burial place will be unclean for seven days.","They should take for the unclean one some of the ashes of the sin offering that was burned and pour running water on them in a container.","Then a clean man will take hyssop and dip it into the water and spatter it on the tent and on all the containers and on the people  who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the slain one or the corpse or the burial place.","The clean person will spatter it on the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day, and he will purify him from sin on the seventh day; then he should wash his garments and bathe in water, and he will become clean in the evening.","“‘But the man who is unclean and who will not purify himself, that person  must be cut off  from the congregation, because he has defiled Jehovah’s sanctuary. The water for cleansing was not sprinkled on him, so he is unclean.","“‘This will serve as a lasting statute for them: The one spattering the water for cleansing should wash his garments, and the one touching the water for cleansing will be unclean until the evening.","Anything the unclean one touches will be unclean, and the person  who touches it will be unclean until the evening.’”"],["In the first month, the entire assembly of the Israelites came into the wilderness of Zin, and the people began dwelling  in Kaʹdesh. It was there that Mirʹi·am died and was buried.","Now there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.","The people were quarreling with Moses, saying: “If only we had died when our brothers died before Jehovah!","Why have you brought Jehovah’s congregation into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?","And why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is no place for seed and figs and vines and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.”","Then Moses and Aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell with their faces to the ground, and Jehovah’s glory began to appear to them.","Then Jehovah said to Moses:","“Take the rod and call the assembly together, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the crag before their eyes that it may give its water, and you will bring out water for them from the crag and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink.”","So Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, just as He had commanded him.","Then Moses and Aaron called the congregation together before the crag, and he said to them: “Hear, now, you rebels! Must we bring out water for you from this crag?”","With that Moses lifted his hand up and struck the crag twice with his rod, and much water began to pour out, and the assembly and their livestock began to drink.","Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron: “Because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel, you will not bring this congregation into the land that I will give them.”","These are the waters of Merʹi·bah,  where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah, so that he was sanctified among them.","Then Moses sent messengers from Kaʹdesh to the king of Eʹdom: “This is what your brother Israel says, ‘You well know all the hardship that we have experienced.","Our fathers went to Egypt, and we dwelled in Egypt many years,  and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.","Finally we cried out to Jehovah, and he heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt, and here we are in Kaʹdesh, a city on the border of your territory.","Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through any field or vineyard, and we will not drink the water of any well. We will march on the King’s Road without turning to the right or the left until we pass through your territory.’”","However, Eʹdom said to him: “You may not pass through our territory. If you do, I will come out with the sword to meet you.”","In turn the Israelites said to him: “By the highway we will go up, and if we and our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We want nothing more than to pass through on foot.”","Still he said: “You may not pass through.” With that Eʹdom came out to encounter him with many people and a strong army.","So Eʹdom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; therefore, Israel turned away from him.","The people of Israel, the entire assembly, departed from Kaʹdesh and came to Mount Hor.","Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by  the border of the land of Eʹdom:","“Aaron will be gathered to his people.  He will not enter the land that I will give to the Israelites, because you both rebelled against my order regarding the waters of Merʹi·bah.","Take Aaron and his son El·e·aʹzar and bring them up into Mount Hor.","Remove Aaron’s garments and clothe El·e·aʹzar his son with them, and Aaron will die there.”","So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor before the eyes of all the assembly.","Then Moses removed Aaron’s garments and clothed El·e·aʹzar his son with them. After that Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and El·e·aʹzar came down from the mountain.","When all the assembly saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel wept for Aaron for 30 days."],["When the Caʹnaan·ite king of Aʹrad, who dwelled in the Negʹeb, heard that Israel had come by the way of Athʹa·rim, he attacked Israel and carried away some of them as captives.","So Israel made this vow to Jehovah: “If you give this people into my hand, I will without fail devote their cities to destruction.”","So Jehovah listened to Israel’s voice and gave the Caʹnaan·ites over to them, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. Therefore, they named the place Horʹmah.","As they continued their journey from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea in order to go around the land of Eʹdom, the people  became weary of the journey.","And the people kept speaking against God and Moses, saying: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no food and no water, and we  have come to hate  this contemptible bread.”","So Jehovah sent poisonous  serpents among the people, and they kept biting the people, so that many Israelites died.","So the people came to Moses and said: “We have sinned by speaking against Jehovah and against you. Intercede with Jehovah so that he may remove the serpents from us.” And Moses interceded on behalf of the people.","Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Make a replica of a poisonous  snake and put it on a pole. Then when anyone has been bitten, he will have to look at it in order to keep alive.”","Moses at once made a serpent of copper and put it on the pole, and whenever a serpent had bitten a man and he looked at the copper serpent, he survived.","After that the Israelites departed and camped in Oʹboth.","Then they departed from Oʹboth and camped in Iʹye-abʹa·rim, in the wilderness that faces Moʹab, toward the east.","From there they departed and camped by the Valley  of Zeʹred.","From there they departed and camped in the region of the Arʹnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amʹor·ites, for the Arʹnon is the boundary of Moʹab, between Moʹab and the Amʹor·ites.","That is why the book of the Wars of Jehovah speaks of “Vaʹheb in Suʹphah and the valleys  of Arʹnon,","and the descent   of the valleys,  which extends toward the settlement of Ar and adjoins the border of Moʹab.”","Next they went on to Beʹer. This is the well about which Jehovah said to Moses: “Gather the people, and let me give them water.”","At that time, Israel sang this song:","The well that princes dug, that nobles of the people excavated,","from Matʹta·nah on to Na·halʹi·el, and from Na·halʹi·el on to Baʹmoth.","They went from Baʹmoth on to the valley that is in the territory  of Moʹab, on top of Pisʹgah, which overlooks Je·shiʹmon.","Israel now sent messengers to Siʹhon, the king of the Amʹor·ites, saying:","“Let us pass through your land. We will not turn aside into a field or a vineyard. We will not drink water from any well. We will march on the King’s Road until we pass through your territory.”","But Siʹhon did not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Siʹhon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness and came to Jaʹhaz and began fighting with Israel.","But Israel defeated him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arʹnon to the Jabʹbok, near the Amʹmon·ites, because Jaʹzer borders the territory of the Amʹmon·ites.","So Israel took all these cities, and they began dwelling in all the cities of the Amʹor·ites, in Heshʹbon and all its dependent  towns.","For Heshʹbon was the city of Siʹhon, the king of the Amʹor·ites, who had fought with the king of Moʹab and taken all his land from him as far as the Arʹnon.","That is what gave rise to the taunting proverbial saying:","For a fire came out of Heshʹbon, a flame from the town of Siʹhon.","Woe to you, Moʹab! You will be destroyed, O people of Cheʹmosh!","Let us shoot at them;","So Israel began to dwell in the land of the Amʹor·ites.","Moses then sent some men to spy on Jaʹzer. They captured its dependent  towns and drove out the Amʹor·ites who were there.","After that they turned and went up by the Way of Baʹshan. And Og the king of Baʹshan came out with all his people to meet them in battle at Edʹre·i.","Jehovah said to Moses: “Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to  Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites, who lived in Heshʹbon.”","So they kept striking him down, along with his sons and all his people, until none of his people survived, and they took possession of his land."],["Then the Israelites departed and camped on the desert plains of Moʹab across the Jordan from Jerʹi·cho.","Now Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor saw all that Israel had done to the Amʹor·ites,","and Moʹab became very frightened of the people, because they were so many; indeed, Moʹab felt sick with fear because of the Israelites.","So Moʹab said to the elders of Midʹi·an: “Now this congregation will devour all our surroundings, just as a bull devours the grass in the field.”","He sent messengers to Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor at Peʹthor, which is by the River  in his native land. He summoned him, saying: “Look! A people has come out of Egypt. Look! They have covered the face  of the earth,  and they are dwelling right in front of me.","Now, please, come and curse this people for me, for they are mightier than I am. Perhaps I can defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I well know that the one whom you bless is blessed and the one whom you curse is cursed.”","So the elders of Moʹab and the elders of Midʹi·an traveled with the fee for divination in their hands and went to Baʹlaam and conveyed to him Baʹlak’s message.","At that he said to them: “Spend the night here, and I will bring back to you whatever word Jehovah speaks to me.” So the princes of Moʹab stayed with Baʹlaam.","Then God came to Baʹlaam and said: “Who are these men with you?”","Baʹlaam said to the true God: “Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor, the king of Moʹab, has sent me a message, saying,","‘Look! The people who are coming out of Egypt are covering the face  of the earth.  Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”","But God said to Baʹlaam: “You must not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed.”","Baʹlaam got up in the morning and said to the princes of Baʹlak: “Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.”","So the princes of Moʹab departed and returned to Baʹlak and said: “Baʹlaam has refused to come with us.”","However, Baʹlak again sent princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first group.","They came to Baʹlaam and said to him: “This is what Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor has said, ‘Please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me,","for I will honor you greatly and I will do anything you tell me to do. So come, please, and curse this people for me.’”","But Baʹlaam answered the servants of Baʹlak: “If Baʹlak were to give me his own house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything beyond the order of Jehovah my God, whether small or great.","But please stay here tonight also, so that I may learn what else Jehovah will tell me.”","Then God came to Baʹlaam by night and said to him: “If these men have come to summon you, go along with them. But you may speak only the words that I tell you to say.”","So Baʹlaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey  and went with the princes of Moʹab.","But God’s anger blazed because he was going, and Jehovah’s angel stationed himself in the road to resist him. Now Baʹlaam was riding on his donkey, and two of his attendants were with him.","And when the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it tried to turn off the road into the field. But Baʹlaam began to beat the donkey to make it return to the road.","Then Jehovah’s angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with stone walls on both sides.","When the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel, it began to squeeze itself against the wall and it jammed Baʹlaam’s foot against the wall, and Baʹlaam began beating it again.","Jehovah’s angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left.","When the donkey saw Jehovah’s angel, it lay down under Baʹlaam, so Baʹlaam became furious and kept beating the donkey with his staff.","Finally Jehovah caused the donkey to speak,  and it said to Baʹlaam: “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”","Baʹlaam replied to the donkey: “It is because you have made a fool of me. If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you!”","Then the donkey said to Baʹlaam: “Am I not your donkey that you have ridden on all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” He replied: “No!”","Then Jehovah uncovered Baʹlaam’s eyes, and he saw Jehovah’s angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. At once he bowed low and prostrated himself on his face.","Then Jehovah’s angel said to him: “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look! I myself came out to offer resistance, because your way is in defiance of my will.","The donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times. Supposing it had not turned away from me! By now I would have killed you and let the donkey live.”","Baʹlaam said to Jehovah’s angel: “I have sinned, because I did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me. And now if it is bad in your eyes, I will go back.”","But Jehovah’s angel said to Baʹlaam: “Go with the men, but you may speak only the words that I tell you.” So Baʹlaam continued going with the princes of Baʹlak.","When Baʹlak heard that Baʹlaam had come, he immediately went out to meet him at the city of Moʹab, which is on the bank of the Arʹnon on the border of the territory.","Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam: “Did I not send for you? Why did you not come to me? Did you think I am not able to honor you greatly?”","Baʹlaam replied to Baʹlak: “Well, I have come to you now. But will I be allowed to say anything? I can only speak words that God puts in my mouth.”","So Baʹlaam went with Baʹlak, and they came to Kirʹi·ath-huʹzoth.","Baʹlak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Baʹlaam and the princes who were with him.","In the morning Baʹlak took Baʹlaam and brought him up to Baʹmoth-baʹal; from there he could see all the people."],["Then Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Build on this spot seven altars, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”","Baʹlak immediately did just as Baʹlaam had said.

Whatever he reveals to me, I will tell you.” So he went to a barren hill.","Then God got in touch with Baʹlaam, who said to Him: “I set the seven altars in rows, and I offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.”","Jehovah put this word in the mouth of Baʹlaam: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.”","So he returned and saw that Baʹlak and all the princes of Moʹab were standing by his burnt offering.","Then he spoke this proverbial saying:","8  How could I put a curse on those whom God has not cursed?","9  From the top of the rocks I see them,","Who can number the dust particles of Jacob","Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “What have you done to me? I brought you to put a curse on my enemies, and here you have done nothing but bless them.”","He answered: “Must I not speak whatever Jehovah puts in my mouth?”","Baʹlak said to him: “Please come with me to another place from which you can see them. You will see only a part of them; you will not see them all. Put a curse on them for me from there.”","So he took him to the field of Zoʹphim, to the top of Pisʹgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.","So Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Stay here by your burnt offering while I get in touch with Him over there.”","And Jehovah got in touch with Baʹlaam and put this word in his mouth: “Return to Baʹlak, and this is what you are to say.”","So he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moʹab were with him. Baʹlak asked him: “What has Jehovah said?”","Then he spoke this proverbial saying:","God is not a mere man who tells lies,","Look! I have been taken to bless;","He does not tolerate any magical power against Jacob,","God is bringing them out of Egypt.","For there are no omens of doom against Jacob,","Here is a people who will rise up like a lion,","Baʹlak then said to Baʹlaam: “If on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him, then on the other hand you should not bless him either.”","Baʹlaam answered Baʹlak: “Did I not say to you, ‘I will do all that Jehovah says’?”","Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam: “Please come and let me take you to yet another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the true God for you to put a curse on him for me from there.”","So Baʹlak took Baʹlaam to the top of Peʹor, which looks toward Je·shiʹmon.","Then Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Build seven altars on this spot, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”","So Baʹlak did just as Baʹlaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."],["When Baʹlaam saw that it pleased  Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go away again to search for omens of doom, but he turned his face to the wilderness.","When Baʹlaam raised his eyes and saw Israel encamped by his tribes, then the spirit of God came upon him.","He then spoke this proverbial saying:","4  The saying of the one hearing the word of God,","5  How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,","6  Like the valleys  they have extended a long way,","7  Water keeps trickling from his two leather buckets,","8  God is bringing him out of Egypt;","9  He has crouched down, he has lain down like the lion,","Then Baʹlak became furious with Baʹlaam. Baʹlak scornfully clapped his hands together and said to Baʹlaam: “It was to put a curse on my enemies that I called you, but now you have done nothing but bless them these three times.","Now go home immediately. I intended to honor you greatly, but look! Jehovah has deprived you of honor.”","Baʹlaam replied to Baʹlak: “Did I not say to the messengers you sent,","‘If Baʹlak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not of my own will  do anything beyond the order of Jehovah, whether good or bad.

Everything that cannot be processed with fire, you should pass through the water.","And you should wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and then you may come into the camp.’”","Jehovah then said this to Moses:","“Take an inventory of the plunder, counting the captives both of humans and animals; do this together with El·e·aʹzar the priest and the heads of the paternal houses of the assembly.","Divide what was plundered into two parts to be shared between those in the army who took part in the battle and all the rest of the assembly.","As a tax for Jehovah, you should take from the soldiers who went out into the battle one soul  out of every 500, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, and the flock.","You should take it from their half and give it to El·e·aʹzar the priest as Jehovah’s contribution.","From the half given to the Israelites, you should take one out of 50, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, the flock, and every sort of domestic animal, and give them to the Levites, who care for the responsibilities connected with Jehovah’s tabernacle.”","So Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.","The spoils, the rest of the plunder that the people of the expedition had taken, amounted to 675,000 of the flock,","72,000 of the herd,","and 61,000 donkeys.","The women who had not had sexual relations with a man amounted to 32,000 women.","The half that was the share of those who went out into the battle amounted to 337,500 of the flock.","The tax for Jehovah from the flock amounted to 675.","And there were 36,000 of the herd, and the tax on them for Jehovah was 72.","And there were 30,500 donkeys, and the tax on them for Jehovah was 61.","And there were 16,000 humans,  and the tax on them for Jehovah was 32 persons.","Then Moses gave the tax as Jehovah’s contribution to El·e·aʹzar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.","From the half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses had divided off from the portion that belonged to the men who waged war,","that half of the flock amounted to 337,500,","and of  the herd, 36,000,","and of the donkeys, 30,500,","and of the people,  16,000.","Then Moses took from the half belonging to the Israelites one out of 50, of the people and of the animals, and gave them to the Levites, who cared for the responsibility of Jehovah’s tabernacle, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.","Then the appointed men who were of the thousands of the army, the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds, approached Moses,","and they said to Moses: “Your servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our command, and not one has been reported missing from us.","So let us each present what he has found as Jehovah’s offering, articles of gold, ankle chains, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and other jewelry, in order to make atonement for ourselves  before Jehovah.”","So Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest accepted the gold from them, all the jewelry.","All the gold of the contribution that they made to Jehovah amounted to 16,750 shekels,  from the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds.","The men of the army had each taken plunder for himself.","Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest accepted the gold from the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder  for the people of Israel before Jehovah."],["Now the sons of Reuʹben and the sons of Gad had very large quantities of livestock, and they saw that the lands of Jaʹzer and Gilʹe·ad were a good region for livestock.","So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuʹben approached Moses, El·e·aʹzar the priest, and the chieftains of the assembly and said:","“Atʹa·roth, Diʹbon, Jaʹzer, Nimʹrah, Heshʹbon, E·le·aʹleh, Seʹbam, Neʹbo, and Beʹon,","the land that Jehovah defeated before the assembly of Israel, is a good land for livestock, and your servants have much livestock.”","They continued: “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this be the land given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”","Then Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuʹben: “Are your brothers to go to war while you yourselves keep dwelling here?","Why should you discourage the people of Israel from crossing into the land that Jehovah is certain to give them?","That is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a to see the land.","When they went up to the Valley  of Eshʹcol and saw the land, they discouraged the people of Israel from going into the land that Jehovah was to give them.","Jehovah’s anger blazed on that day so that he swore:","‘The men who came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and up will not see the land of which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not followed me wholeheartedly—","except Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh the Kenʹiz·zite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have followed Jehovah wholeheartedly.’","So Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness for 40 years, until all the generation that was  doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah came to its end.","Now here you have risen in the place of your fathers as a brood of sinful men who increase the burning anger of Jehovah against Israel.","If you turn back from following him, he will certainly leave them again in the wilderness, and you will bring ruin to all this people.”","They later approached him and said: “Let us build here stone pens for our livestock and cities for our children.","But we will continue ready for battle and will go before the Israelites until we have brought them to their place, while our children will dwell in the fortified cities, safe from the inhabitants of the land.","We will not return to our houses until each of the Israelites has received his land as an inheritance.","For we will not receive an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because we have received our inheritance on the east side of the Jordan.”","Moses replied to them: “If you will do this: Take up arms before Jehovah for the war;","and if every one of you takes up arms and crosses the Jordan before Jehovah as he drives away his enemies from before him","until the land is subdued before Jehovah, afterward you may return and be free from guilt before Jehovah and Israel. Then this land will become your possession before Jehovah.","But if you do not do this, you will have sinned against Jehovah. In that case, know that your sin will catch up with you.","So you may build cities for your children and pens for your flocks, but you must do what you have promised.”","The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuʹben said this to Moses: “Your servants will do just as my lord is commanding.","Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our domestic animals will stay there in the cities of Gilʹe·ad,","but your servants will cross over, every man armed for battle to wage war before Jehovah, just as my lord is speaking.”","So Moses gave a command concerning them to El·e·aʹzar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel.","Moses said to them: “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuʹben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for the war before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, you will then give them the land of Gilʹe·ad as a possession.","But if they do not take up arms and cross over with you, they will then settle among you in the land of Caʹnaan.”","To this the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuʹben answered: “What Jehovah has spoken to your servants is what we will do.","We will take up arms and cross over before Jehovah to the land of Caʹnaan, but the possession we are to inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.”","So Moses gave to them—to the sons of Gad, the sons of Reuʹben, and to the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh the son of Joseph—the kingdom of Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites and the kingdom of Og the king of Baʹshan, the land belonging to its cities in those territories, and the cities of the surrounding land.","And the sons of Gad built  Diʹbon, Atʹa·roth, A·roʹer,","Atʹroth-shoʹphan, Jaʹzer, Jogʹbe·hah,","Beth-nimʹrah, and Beth-haʹran, fortified cities, and they built stone pens for  the flocks.","And the sons of Reuʹben built Heshʹbon, E·le·aʹleh, Kir·i·a·thaʹim,","Neʹbo, and Baʹal-meʹon—their names being changed—and Sibʹmah; and they began to rename the cities that they rebuilt.","The sons of Maʹchir the son of Ma·nasʹseh marched against Gilʹe·ad and captured it and drove away the Amʹor·ites who were in it.","So Moses gave Gilʹe·ad to Maʹchir the son of Ma·nasʹseh, and he began dwelling in it.","And Jaʹir the son of Ma·nasʹseh marched against them and captured their tent villages, and he began to call them Havʹvoth-jaʹir.","And Noʹbah marched against and captured Keʹnath and its dependent  towns, and he began to call it Noʹbah by his own name."],["These were the stages of the journey of the people of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies  under the direction of Moses and Aaron.","Moses kept recording the departure places by the stages of their journey at the order of Jehovah, and these were their stages from one departure place to another:","They departed from Ramʹe·ses in the first month, on the 15th day of the month.

Now turn north.","And give this command to the people: “You will pass by the border of your brothers, the descendants of Eʹsau, who are dwelling in Seʹir, and they will be afraid of you, and you must be very careful.","Do not engage in hostilities with  them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even the space of a footprint, because I have given Mount Seʹir to Eʹsau as his possession.","You should give them money for the food you will eat, and you should pay for the water you will drink.","For Jehovah your God has blessed you in all that you have done. He is fully aware of your walking through this great wilderness. These 40 years Jehovah your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.”’","So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Eʹsau, who are dwelling in Seʹir, keeping away from the way of the Arʹa·bah, from Eʹlath and from Eʹzi·on-geʹber.","Jehovah then said to me, ‘Do not engage in hostilities or in war with Moʹab, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession because I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.","(The Eʹmim formerly lived there, a people great and numerous and tall like the Anʹa·kim.","The Rephʹa·im were also considered like the Anʹa·kim,  and the Moʹab·ites used to call them Eʹmim.","Previously, the Horʹites were living in Seʹir, but the descendants of Eʹsau dispossessed and annihilated them and settled in their place, just as Israel will do to the land that is their possession, which Jehovah will certainly give to them.)","Now go and cross over the Valley  of Zeʹred.’ So we crossed over the Valley  of Zeʹred.","The time it took us to walk from Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a until we crossed the Valley  of Zeʹred was 38 years, until the entire generation of the men of war had perished from the camp, just as Jehovah had sworn to them.","Jehovah’s hand was against them to eliminate them from the camp until they had perished.","“As soon as all the men of war had died off from among the people,","Jehovah spoke to me again, saying,","‘Today you are to pass by the territory of Moʹab, that is, Ar.","When you come near to the Amʹmon·ites, do not harass or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Amʹmon·ites as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.","This too used to be considered the land of the Rephʹa·im. (The Rephʹa·im formerly lived there, and the Amʹmon·ites used to call them Zam·zumʹmim.","They were a great and numerous and tall people like the Anʹa·kim; but Jehovah annihilated them before the Amʹmon·ites, and these drove them out and settled in their place.","That is what he did for the descendants of Eʹsau, who now dwell in Seʹir, when he annihilated the Horʹites from before them, so that they could dispossess them and dwell in their place to this very day.","As for the Avʹvim, they had dwelled in settlements as far as Gazʹa until the Caphʹto·rim, who came out from Caphʹtor,  annihilated them and settled in their place.)","“‘Get up, and make your way across the Arʹnon Valley.  See, I have given into your hand Siʹhon the Amʹor·ite, king of Heshʹbon. So begin taking possession of his land, and engage him in war.","This day I will start to put the dread and the fear of you upon all the people under the heavens who hear the report about you. They will be disturbed and will tremble  because of you.’","“Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedʹe·moth to King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon, with these peaceful words,","‘Let me pass through your land. I will remain on the road and not turn to the right or to the left.","I will eat only the food and drink only the water that you will sell to me. Just allow me to pass through on foot","—that is what the descendants of Eʹsau dwelling in Seʹir and the Moʹab·ites dwelling in Ar did for me—until I pass over the Jordan into the land that Jehovah our God is giving to us.’","But King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon did not let us pass through, because Jehovah your God allowed his spirit to become obstinate and his heart to become hard, in order to give him into your hand as is now the case.","“Then Jehovah said to me, ‘See, I have already begun to give Siʹhon and his land over to you. Start to take possession of his land.’","When Siʹhon came out along with all his people to meet us in battle  at Jaʹhaz,","Jehovah our God handed him over to us, so that we defeated him, his sons, and all his people.","We captured all his cities at that time and devoted every city to destruction, including men, women, and children. We left no survivor.","We plundered only the livestock for ourselves along with the spoils from the cities that we had captured.","From A·roʹer, which is on the rim of the Arʹnon Valley  (including the city that is in the valley), as far as Gilʹe·ad, no town was beyond our reach. Jehovah our God handed them all over to us.","However, you did not approach the land of the Amʹmon·ites, the whole bank of the Valley  of Jabʹbok and the cities of the mountainous region, or any other place forbidden by Jehovah our God."],["“Then we turned and went up by the Way of Baʹshan. And Og, the king of Baʹshan, came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Edʹre·i.","So Jehovah said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites, who lived in Heshʹbon.’","So Jehovah our God also gave King Og of Baʹshan and all his people into our hand, and we kept striking him down until none of his people survived.","We then captured all his cities. There was no town that we did not take from them—60 cities, all the region of Arʹgob, the kingdom of Og in Baʹshan.","All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, along with a great number of rural towns.","However, we devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon, in devoting every city to destruction, including men, women, and children.","And we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities for ourselves.","“At that time we seized the land of the two Amʹor·ite kings who were in the region of the Jordan, from the Arʹnon Valley  as far as Mount Herʹmon","(the mountain that the Si·doʹni·ans used to call Sirʹi·on and the Amʹor·ites used to call Seʹnir),","all the cities of the tableland,  all Gilʹe·ad, and all Baʹshan as far as Salʹe·cah and Edʹre·i, the cities of the kingdom that belonged to Og in Baʹshan.","For King Og of Baʹshan was the last remaining one of the Rephʹa·im. His bier  was made of iron,  and it is still in Rabʹbah of the Amʹmon·ites. It is nine cubits  long and four cubits wide, by the standard cubit.","At that time we took possession of this land: from A·roʹer, which is by the Arʹnon Valley,  and half of the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad, and I have given its cities to the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites.","And the rest of Gilʹe·ad and all Baʹshan of the kingdom of Og I have given to the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh. All the region of Arʹgob, which belongs to Baʹshan, was known as the land of the Rephʹa·im.","“Jaʹir the son of Ma·nasʹseh took all the region of Arʹgob as far as the boundary of the Geshʹur·ites and the Ma·acʹa·thites and named those villages of Baʹshan after himself, Havʹvoth-jaʹir,  to this day.","And I have given Gilʹe·ad to Maʹchir.","And to the  Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites, I have given from Gilʹe·ad to the Arʹnon Valley,  with the middle of the valley as a boundary, and as far as Jabʹbok, the valley that is the boundary of the Amʹmon·ites,","and the Arʹa·bah and the Jordan and the border, from Chinʹne·reth to the Sea of the Arʹa·bah, the Salt Sea,  at the base of the slopes of Pisʹgah toward the east.","“I then gave you this command: ‘Jehovah your God has given you this land to take possession of it. All your valiant men will take up arms and cross over before your brothers, the Israelites.","Only your wives, your children, and your livestock (I well know that you have a great deal of livestock) will continue dwelling in the cities that I have given you,","until Jehovah gives your brothers rest, as he does for you, and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah your God will give them across the Jordan. Then you will come back, each one to his possession that I have given you.’","“At that time I gave this command to Joshua: ‘You have seen with your own eyes what Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. Jehovah will do the same thing to all the kingdoms into which you will cross over.","You must not be afraid of them, for Jehovah your God is the one fighting for you.’","“At that time I pleaded with Jehovah, saying,","‘O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty arm, for what god in the heavens or on the earth performs such mighty deeds as you?","Please let me pass over and see the good land that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous region and Lebʹa·non.’","But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. Rather, Jehovah said to me, ‘Enough from you! Never speak to me again about this matter.","Go up to the top of Pisʹgah, and look to the west and north and south and east and view the land with your eyes, for you will not cross over this Jordan.","Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.’","All this happened while we were dwelling in the valley in front of Beth-peʹor."],["“Now, O Israel, listen to the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, is giving you.","You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, neither must you take away from it, so as to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God that I am commanding you.","“Your own eyes have seen what Jehovah did in the case of the Baʹal of Peʹor; Jehovah your God annihilated from your midst every man who walked after the Baʹal of Peʹor.","But you who are holding fast to Jehovah your God are all alive today.","See, I have taught you regulations and judicial decisions, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, so that you may observe them in the land you will take possession of.","You must carefully follow them, because this will show wisdom and understanding on your part before  the peoples who will hear about all these regulations, and they will say, ‘This great nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people.’","For what great nation has gods as near to it as Jehovah our God is to us whenever we call on him?","And what great nation has righteous regulations and judicial decisions like this entire Law that I am putting before you today?","“Just be careful and watch yourself closely,  so that you may not forget the things that your eyes have seen and so that they may not depart from your heart all the days of your life. You must also make them known to your sons and to your grandsons.","On the day that you stood before Jehovah your God in Horʹeb, Jehovah said to me, ‘Congregate the people together to me so that I may let them hear my words, in order that they may learn to fear me all the days that they are alive on the ground and that they may teach their sons.’","“So you came near and stood at the base of the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the very heavens;  there was darkness, cloud, and thick gloom.","And Jehovah began to speak to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but you saw no form—there was only a voice.","And he declared his covenant to you, which he commanded you to observe—the Ten Commandments.  Afterward, he wrote them on two tablets of stone.","At that time Jehovah commanded me to teach you regulations and judicial decisions, which you are to observe in the land you will enter to take possession of.","“Therefore, watch yourselves closely —since you did not see any form on the day Jehovah spoke to you in Horʹeb out of the middle of the fire—","that you may not act corruptly by making for yourselves any carved image having the form of any symbol, the representation of male or female,","the representation of any animal on the earth or the representation of any bird that flies in the sky,","the representation of anything creeping on the ground or the representation of any fish in the waters under the earth.","And when you raise your eyes to the heavens and see the sun and the moon and the stars—all the army of the heavens—do not get seduced and bow down to them and serve them. Jehovah your God has given them to all the peoples under the whole heavens.","But you are the ones Jehovah took and brought out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to become the people of his personal possession,  as you are today.","“Jehovah became angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan or go into the good land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.","For I am to die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan, but you will cross over and take possession of this good land.","Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God that he made with you, and do not make for yourselves a carved image, the form of anything forbidden to you by Jehovah your God.","For Jehovah  your God is a consuming fire, a God who requires exclusive devotion.","“If you become father to sons and grandsons and you have lived a long time in the land and you act ruinously and make a carved image of any kind and you do what is evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God so as to offend him,","I do take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that you will surely and quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of. You will not last long on it, but you will be utterly annihilated.","Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and just a few of you will survive among the nations to which Jehovah will have driven you.","There you will have to serve gods of wood and stone made by human hands, gods that cannot see or hear or eat or smell.","“If you search for Jehovah your God from there, you will certainly find him, if you inquire for him with all your heart and with all your soul.","When you are in great distress and all these things have happened to you in later times, then you will return to Jehovah your God and listen to his voice.","For Jehovah your God is a merciful God. He will not desert you or bring you to ruin or forget the covenant that he swore to your forefathers.","“Ask, now, about the former days before your time, from the day when God created man on the earth; search from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens. Has anything so great ever happened or has anything like it ever been heard of?","Have any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire the way you have heard it and kept on living?","Or has God ever attempted to take for himself a nation out of the midst of another nation along with judgments,  with signs, with miracles, with war, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with terrifying deeds, as Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?","You yourselves have been shown these things so you will know that Jehovah is the true God; there is no other besides him.","He made you hear his voice from the heavens to correct you, and on the earth he made you see his great fire, and his words you heard from out of the fire.","“Because he loved your forefathers and has chosen their offspring  after them, you were brought out of Egypt in his presence by his great power.","From before you he drove away nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as it is today.","Know, therefore, on this day, and take it to heart that Jehovah is the true God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. There is no other.","You must keep his regulations and his commandments that I am commanding you today, in order that it may go well with you and your sons after you, so that you may long remain in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.”","At that time Moses set apart three cities on the eastern side of the Jordan.","If any manslayer unintentionally kills his fellow man and he did not previously hate him, he must flee to one of these cities and live.","The cities are Beʹzer in the wilderness on the  tableland  for the Reuʹben·ites, Raʹmoth in Gilʹe·ad for the Gadʹites, and Goʹlan in Baʹshan for the Ma·nasʹsites.","Now this is the Law that Moses set before the people of Israel.","These are the reminders, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that Moses gave to the Israelites after they came out of Egypt,","in the region of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peʹor, in the land of King Siʹhon of the Amʹor·ites, who was dwelling in Heshʹbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated after coming out of Egypt.","And they took possession of his land and of the land of King Og of Baʹshan, the two kings of the Amʹor·ites who were in the region east of the Jordan,","from A·roʹer, which is on the rim of the Arʹnon Valley,  up to Mount Siʹon, that is, Herʹmon,","and all the Arʹa·bah in the region east of the Jordan, and as far as the Sea of the Arʹa·bah,  at the base of the slopes of Pisʹgah."],["Moses then summoned all Israel and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am announcing to you today, and you must learn them and carefully observe them.","Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horʹeb.","It was not with our forefathers that Jehovah made this covenant, but with us, all of us alive here today.","Jehovah spoke face-to-face with you in the mountain, out of the fire.","I was standing between Jehovah and you at that time to convey to you the word of Jehovah, for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain.

Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.","Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand on him; and the Israelites began to listen to him, and they did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.","But there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face-to-face.","He performed all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land,","along with the mighty hand and the awesome power that Moses displayed before the eyes of all Israel."]],"Joshua":[["After the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah said to Joshua  the son of Nun, the minister of Moses:","“Moses my servant is dead. Now get up, cross the Jordan, you and all this people, and go into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.","I will give you every place on which you set your foot, just as I promised Moses.","Your territory will extend from the wilderness up to Lebʹa·non and to the great river, the Eu·phraʹtes—all the land of the Hitʹtites—and to the Great Sea  on the west.","No one will be able to take a stand against you as long as you live. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will neither desert you nor abandon you.","Be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their forefathers I would give to them.","“Only be courageous and very strong, and observe carefully the entire Law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not deviate from it either to the right or to the left, so that you may act wisely wherever you go.","This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone  day and night, in order to observe carefully all that is written in it; for then your way will be successful and then you will act wisely.","Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and strong. Do not be struck with terror or fear, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.”","Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:","“Pass throughout the camp and give this command to the people, ‘Get provisions ready, because in three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.’”","And to the Reuʹben·ites, the Gadʹites, and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh, Joshua said:","“Remember what Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you: ‘Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.","Your wives, your children, and your livestock will dwell in the land that Moses has given you on this side  of the Jordan, but all you mighty warriors should cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers. You must help them","until Jehovah gives your brothers rest, just as he has given you, and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving them. Then return to the land you were given to occupy and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on the east side of the Jordan.’”","They answered Joshua: “We will do all that you have commanded, and we will go wherever you send us.","Just as we listened to everything Moses said, so we will listen to you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you just as he was with Moses.","Any man who rebels against your order and does not obey every command you give him will be put to death. Only be courageous and strong.”"],["Then Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out from Shitʹtim as spies. He told them: “Go and inspect the land, especially Jerʹi·cho.” So they went and came to the house of a prostitute named Raʹhab, and they stayed there.","The king of Jerʹi·cho was told: “Look! Israelite men have come in here tonight to spy out the land.”","At that the king of Jerʹi·cho sent word to Raʹhab: “Bring out the men who came and are staying in your house, for they have come to spy out the entire land.”","But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said: “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.","And at dark when the city gate was about to be closed, the men went out. I do not know where the men went, but if you quickly chase after them, you will catch up with them.”","(However, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among stalks of flax laid in rows on the roof.)","So the men chased after them in the direction of the Jordan at the fords, and the city gate was shut once the pursuers had gone out.","Before the men lay down to sleep, she came up to them on the roof.","She said to the men: “I do know that Jehovah will give you the land and that the fear of you has fallen upon us. All the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of you,","for we heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amʹor·ites, Siʹhon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction on the other side  of the Jordan.","When we heard about it, we lost heart,  and no one has any courage  because of you, for Jehovah your God is  God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.","Now, please, swear to me by Jehovah that, because I showed loyal love to you, you will also show loyal love to my father’s household; and you must give me a sign of good faith.","You must spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and you must save us  from death.”","At that the men said to her: “We will give our lives for yours!  If you do not tell about our mission, then we will show loyal love and faithfulness toward you when Jehovah gives us the land.”","After that she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on a side of the city wall. In fact, she was dwelling on the wall.","Then she said to them: “Go to the mountainous region and hide there for three days, so that those pursuing you may not find you. Then, after your pursuers have come back, you can go on your way.”","The men said to her: “We will be free from guilt respecting this oath that you made us swear","unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window by which you let us down. You should gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household with you into the house.","Then if anyone goes out the doors of your house into the open, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be free from guilt. But if harm comes to  anyone who remains with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads.","But if you report our mission, we will be free from guilt respecting your oath that you made us swear.”","She replied: “Let it be according to your words.”","So they left and went to the mountainous region and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had been looking for them on every road but did not find them.","The two men then descended from the mountainous region and crossed the river and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They related to him all the things that had happened to them.","Then they said to Joshua: “Jehovah has handed over the entire land to us. In fact, all the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of us.”"],["Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and he and all the Israelites  departed from Shitʹtim and came to the Jordan. They spent the night there before crossing over.","After three days, the officers passed throughout the camp","and commanded the people: “As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you should depart from your place and follow it.","But keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits  from it; do not come any nearer to it, so that you may know which is the way to go, for you have not traveled on this way before.”","Joshua now said to the people: “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you.”","Then Joshua said to the priests: “Take up the ark of the  covenant and pass ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.","Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “This day I will start to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you just as I was with Moses.","You should give this command to the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you should stand still in the Jordan.’”","And Joshua said to the Israelites: “Come here and listen to the words of Jehovah your God.”","Joshua then said: “By this you will know that a living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive away from before you the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Hiʹvites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Girʹga·shites, the Amʹor·ites, and the Jebʹu·sites.","Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is passing ahead of you into the Jordan.","Now take 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe,","and as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth, touch  the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from upstream will be halted and they will stand still like a dam.”","So when the people departed from their tents just before crossing the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of the people.","As soon as the carriers of the Ark reached the Jordan and the priests carrying the Ark dipped their feet into the edge of the waters (now the Jordan overflows its banks all the days of harvest),","the waters flowing from upstream stood still. They rose up like a dam  very far away at Adam, the city near Zarʹe·than, while the waters descending toward the Sea of the Arʹa·bah, the Salt Sea,  drained away. They were halted, and the people crossed over opposite Jerʹi·cho.","While the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah’s covenant kept standing still on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, all Israel crossed over on dry ground until the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan."],["As soon as the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, Jehovah said to Joshua:","“Take 12 men from the people, one man from each tribe,","and give them this command: ‘Take up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood still, and carry them over with you and set them down in the place where you will spend the night.’”","So Joshua called the 12 men whom he had appointed from the Israelites, one man from each tribe,","and Joshua said to them: “Pass ahead of the Ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each of you should lift up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,","to serve as a sign among you. If your children  should later ask you, ‘Why do you have these stones?’","you must tell them: ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were halted from before the ark of Jehovah’s covenant. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were halted. These stones will serve as a lasting memorial  to the people of Israel.’”","So the Israelites did just as Joshua had commanded. They took up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as Jehovah had instructed Joshua, to correspond to the number of the tribes of the Israelites. They took them over to the place where they would spend the night and set them down there.","Joshua also set up 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood, and the stones are there to this day.","The priests carrying the Ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Jehovah had ordered Joshua to tell the people to do was completed, in harmony with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. All the while, the people hurried across.","As soon as all the people had finished crossing over, the Ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over in the sight of the people.","And the Reuʹben·ites, the Gadʹites, and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh crossed over in battle formation ahead of the other Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them.","About 40,000 soldiers armed for battle crossed over before Jehovah onto the desert plains of Jerʹi·cho.","On that day Jehovah exalted Joshua in the eyes of all Israel, and they deeply respected  him all the days of his life, just as they had deeply respected Moses.","Then Jehovah said to Joshua:","“Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.”","So Joshua commanded the priests: “Come up out of the Jordan.”","When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the middle of the Jordan and the soles of the feet of the priests stepped onto dry ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course and overflowed the banks as before.","The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilʹgal on the eastern border of Jerʹi·cho.","As for the 12 stones that they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set these up at Gilʹgal.","Then he said to the Israelites: “In the future when your children ask their fathers, ‘What do these stones mean?’","you must explain to your children: ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry land","when Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before them until they had crossed it, just as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we crossed it.","He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know how mighty Jehovah’s hand is and so that you may always fear Jehovah your God.’”"],["As soon as all the kings of the Amʹor·ites who were on the west side  of the Jordan and all the kings of the Caʹnaan·ites who were by the sea heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, they lost heart,  and they lost all courage  because of the Israelites.","At that time Jehovah said to Joshua: “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise the men of Israel again, a second time.”","So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of  Israel at Gibʹe·ath-ha·arʹa·loth.","This is why Joshua circumcised them: All the males of the people who left Egypt, all the men of war,  had died in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt.","All the people who left Egypt were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt were not circumcised.","The Israelites had walked for 40 years in the wilderness until the entire nation had died off, that is, the men of war who left Egypt who did not obey the voice of Jehovah. Jehovah swore to them that he would never let them see the land that Jehovah had sworn to their forefathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.","So he raised up their sons instead of them. These Joshua circumcised; they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them during the journey.","When they finished circumcising the entire nation, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered.","Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Today I have rolled away from you the reproach of Egypt.” So that place has been called Gilʹgal  until this day.","The Israelites continued to camp at Gilʹgal, and they observed the Passover on the 14th day of the month, in the evening, on the desert plains of Jerʹi·cho.","And they began to eat the produce of the land the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grains, on this same day.","Then the manna stopped on the day following when they had eaten some of the produce of the land; there was no longer manna for the Israelites, but they began to eat the produce of the land of Caʹnaan in that year.","When Joshua was near Jerʹi·cho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua walked up to him and asked: “Are you on our side or on the side of our adversaries?”","To this he said: “No, but I have come as prince  of Jehovah’s army.” With that Joshua fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and said to him: “What does my lord have to say to his servant?”","The prince of Jehovah’s army replied to Joshua: “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy.” At once Joshua did so."],["Now Jerʹi·cho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites; no one was leaving and no one was entering.","Jehovah then said to Joshua: “See, I have handed over to you Jerʹi·cho and its king and its mighty warriors.","All you fighting men should march around the city, going around the city once. That is what you should do for six days.","Have seven priests carry seven ram’s horns before the Ark. But on the seventh day, you should march around the city seven times and the priests should blow the horns.","When the ram’s horn is sounded—as soon as you hear the sound  of the horn—all the people should shout a great war cry. Then the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people must go up, each one straight ahead.”","So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests together and told them: “Take up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests should carry seven ram’s horns  before the Ark of Jehovah.”","Then he told the people: “Move on and march around the city, and the armed troops should go ahead of the Ark of Jehovah.”","And just as Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying seven ram’s horns before Jehovah went forward and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah was following them.","And the armed troops went ahead of the priests who were blowing the horns, and the rear guard followed the Ark as the horns were blown continuously.","Now Joshua had commanded the people: “Do not shout nor let your voices be heard. Not a word should come out of your mouths until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then shout.”","He had the Ark of Jehovah go around the city, going around it once, after which they returned to the camp and spent the night there.","The next morning Joshua got up early, and the priests took up the Ark of Jehovah,","and seven priests carrying seven ram’s horns walked before the Ark of Jehovah, continuously blowing the horns. The armed troops were walking ahead of them while the rear guard was following the Ark of Jehovah as the horns were blown continuously.","They marched around the city on the second day once, after which they returned to the camp. That was what they did for six days.","On the seventh day they got up early, as soon as the dawn broke, and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.","And on the seventh time, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua told the people: “Shout, for Jehovah has given you the city!","The city and everything in it is to be devoted to destruction; it all belongs to Jehovah. Only Raʹhab the prostitute may keep living, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers we sent out.","But keep away from what is devoted to destruction, so that you do not desire something devoted to destruction and take it, making the camp of Israel something devoted to destruction by bringing disaster  on it.","But all the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron are holy to Jehovah. They should go into the treasury of Jehovah.”","Then the people shouted when the horns were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the horn and shouted a great war cry, the wall fell down flat. After that the people went up into the city, each one straight ahead, and they captured the city.","They devoted all that was in the city to destruction by the sword, man and woman, young and old, bull, sheep, and donkey.","Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land: “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.”","So the young spies went in and brought out Raʹhab, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all who belonged to her; yes, they brought out her whole family, and they brought them safely to a place outside the camp of Israel.","Then they burned the city and everything in it with fire. But the silver, the gold, and the articles of copper and iron,  they gave to the treasury of Jehovah’s house.","Only Raʹhab the prostitute and her father’s household and all who belonged to her were spared by Joshua; and she lives in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent out to spy on Jerʹi·cho.","At that time Joshua pronounced this oath:  “Cursed be the man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city of Jerʹi·cho. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will put up its doors.”","So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread through all the earth."],["But the Israelites were unfaithful with regard to what had been devoted to destruction, for Aʹchan son of Carʹmi, son of Zabʹdi, son of Zeʹrah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was devoted to destruction. At this Jehovah’s anger blazed against the Israelites.","Then Joshua sent men out from Jerʹi·cho to Aʹi, which is close by Beth-aʹven and east of Bethʹel, telling them: “Go up and spy on the land.” So the men went up and spied on Aʹi.","When they returned to Joshua, they told him: “Not all the people need to go up. About two or three thousand men are enough to defeat Aʹi. Do not tire out all the people by making them go, for there are only a few of them.”","So about 3,000 men went up there, but they had to flee from the men of Aʹi.","The men of Aʹi struck down 36 men, and they pursued them from outside the city gate as far as Shebʹa·rim,  and they continued striking them down on the descent. So the courage  of the people melted and flowed away like water.","At this Joshua ripped his garments and fell with his face to the ground before the Ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they kept throwing dust on their heads.","Joshua said: “Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, why did you bring this people all the way across the Jordan just to hand us over to the Amʹor·ites to be destroyed? If only we had been satisfied to remain on the other side  of the Jordan!","Pardon me, O Jehovah, what can I say now that Israel has retreated  before his enemies?","When the Caʹnaan·ites and all the inhabitants of the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe out our very name from the earth, and what will you do about your great name?”","Jehovah replied to Joshua: “Get up! Why are you lying on your face?","Israel has sinned. They have violated my covenant that I commanded them to keep. They took some of what was devoted to destruction, stealing it and secretly putting it among their own possessions.","Therefore, the Israelites will not be able to stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and flee from their enemies, because they have become something devoted to destruction. I will not be with you again unless you annihilate from your midst what was devoted to destruction.","Get up and sanctify the people! Tell them, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: “What is devoted to destruction is among you, O Israel. You will  not be able to stand against your enemies until you remove from your midst the thing devoted to destruction.","You are to present yourselves in the morning, tribe by tribe, and the tribe that Jehovah selects will come near, family by family, and the family that Jehovah selects will come near, household by household, and the household that Jehovah selects will come near, man by man.","And the one who is caught with the thing devoted to destruction will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has violated the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed a disgraceful act in Israel.”’”","So Joshua rose early the next morning and had Israel come near, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.","He had the families of Judah come near and the family of the Zeʹrah·ites was selected, after which he had the family of the Zeʹrah·ites come near, man by man, and Zabʹdi was selected.","Finally he had the household of Zabʹdi come near, man by man, and Aʹchan son of Carʹmi, son of Zabʹdi, son of Zeʹrah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.","Then Joshua said to Aʹchan: “My son, please, honor Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him. Tell me, please, what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”","Aʹchan answered Joshua: “For a fact I am the one who sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.","When I saw among the spoil a good-looking official garment from Shiʹnar and 200 shekels  of silver and one gold bar weighing 50 shekels, I desired them, so I took them. They are now hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the money underneath.”","At once Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there the garment was hidden in his tent, with the money underneath it.","So they took the things out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and placed them before Jehovah.","Joshua and all Israel with him then took Aʹchan the son of Zeʹrah, the silver, the official garment, and the bar of gold, along with his sons, his daughters, his bull, his donkey, his flock, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them up to the Valley  of Aʹchor.","Joshua said: “Why have you brought disaster  upon us? Jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day.” With that all Israel stoned him, after which they burned them with fire. Thus they stoned all of them.","And they raised a huge pile of stones over him that remains to this day. At this Jehovah’s hot anger subsided. That is why the name of that place is Valley of Aʹchor  to this day."],["Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid or be terrified. Take with you all the fighting men and go up against Aʹi. See, I have handed over to you the king of Aʹi, his people, his city, and his land.","Do to Aʹi and to its king just as you did to Jerʹi·cho and its king, except you may plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”","So Joshua and all the fighting men went up against Aʹi. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty warriors and sent them off by night.","He gave them this command: “See, you are to lie in  ambush behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, and all of you be ready.","I and all the people with me will approach the city, and when they come out against us as before, we will retreat from them.","When they come out after us, we will draw them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are retreating from us just as before.’ And we will retreat from them.","Then you should rise up from the ambush and capture the city; Jehovah your God will hand it over to you.","As soon as you have seized the city, you should set it on fire. You should do according to Jehovah’s word. See, I have given you your orders.”","Then Joshua sent them out, and they marched to the place of ambush; they took a position between Bethʹel and Aʹi, to the west of Aʹi, while Joshua spent that night with the people.","After Joshua rose up early in the morning and gathered  the troops, he and the elders of Israel led them to Aʹi.","All the fighting men who were with him marched up and advanced to the front of the city. They camped to the north of Aʹi, with the valley between them and Aʹi.","In the meantime, he had taken about 5,000 men and had set them as an ambush between Bethʹel and Aʹi, to the west of the city.","So the people set the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard west of the city, and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.","And as soon as the king of Aʹi saw this, he and the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush set against him to the rear of the city.","When the men of Aʹi attacked, Joshua and all Israel fled along the road in the direction of the wilderness.","Then all the people who were in the city were summoned to pursue them; and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.","Not a man was remaining in Aʹi and Bethʹel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city wide open and pursued Israel.","Jehovah now said to Joshua: “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Aʹi, for into your hand I will give it.” So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.","The moment he stretched out his hand, the ambush rose up quickly from its place and ran into the city and captured it. They immediately set the city on fire.","When the men of Aʹi turned around, they saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky, and they had no strength to flee in any direction. Then the people who had been fleeing toward the wilderness turned on their pursuers.","When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and saw the smoke of the city rising, they turned around and attacked the men of Aʹi.","And the others came out of the city to meet them, so that the men of Aʹi were trapped in the middle, with some Israelites on this side and some on that side, and they struck them down until there was not one survivor or escapee remaining.","But they caught the king of Aʹi alive and brought him before Joshua.","After Israel finished killing all the inhabitants of Aʹi in the field, in the wilderness where they had pursued them, and every last one of them had fallen by the sword, then all Israel  returned to Aʹi and struck it with the sword.","All those who fell on that day, from man to woman, amounted to 12,000, all the people of Aʹi.","Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he had stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Aʹi to destruction.","However, Israel took the livestock and the spoil of that city for themselves, according to the orders that Jehovah had given to Joshua.","Then Joshua burned Aʹi and reduced it to a permanent mound of ruins, as it remains to this day.","He hung the king of Aʹi on a stake  until the evening, and as the sun was about to set, Joshua gave the order to take his dead body down from the stake. Then they pitched it at the entrance of the city gate and raised up a great pile of stones over him, which is there to this day.","It was then that Joshua built an altar on Mount Eʹbal to Jehovah the God of Israel,","just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the Israelites and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: “An altar of whole stones on which no iron tool has been wielded.” On it they offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah as well as communion sacrifices.","Then he wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law that Moses had written before the Israelites.","All Israel, their elders, the officers, and their judges were standing on both sides of the Ark in front of the Levitical priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. The foreign residents were there as well as the natives. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerʹi·zim, and the other half in front of Mount Eʹbal (just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had previously commanded), to bless the people of Israel.","After this he read aloud all the words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the book of the Law.","There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read aloud in front of all the congregation of Israel, including the women and children and the foreign residents who were living  among them."],["When all the kings who were on the west side of the Jordan heard what had happened, those in the mountainous region, in the She·pheʹlah, along the entire coast of the Great Sea,  and in front of Lebʹa·non—the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites—","they formed an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.","The inhabitants of Gibʹe·on also heard what Joshua had done to Jerʹi·cho and Aʹi.","So they acted shrewdly and put provisions into worn-out sacks on their donkeys, along with worn-out wineskins that had burst and had been mended;","they also had worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and they were wearing worn-out garments. All the bread of their provisions was dry and crumbly.","Then they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilʹgal and said to him and the men of Israel: “We have come from a distant land. Now make a covenant with us.”","But the men of Israel said to the Hiʹvites: “Perhaps you are living near us. So how can we make a covenant with you?”","They replied to Joshua: “We are your servants.”","At this they said to him: “Your servants have come from a very distant land out of regard for the name of Jehovah your God, because we have heard about his fame and about all he did in Egypt","and about all he did to the two kings of the Amʹor·ites who were on the other side  of the Jordan, King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon and King Og of Baʹshan, who was in Ashʹta·roth.","So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey and go to meet them. Tell them: “We will be your servants; now make a covenant with us.”’","This bread that we took as our provisions was still hot on the day we left our houses to come here to you. Now you can see it is dry and crumbly.","And these wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they have burst. And our garments and sandals have worn out because of the great length of the journey.”","At that the men took  some of their provisions, but they did not inquire of Jehovah.","So Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live, and that is what the chieftains of the assembly swore to them in an oath.","At the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that they lived nearby, in their vicinity.","Then the Israelites set out and came to their cities on the third day; their cities were Gibʹe·on, Che·phiʹrah, Be·erʹoth, and Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim.","But the Israelites did not attack them, because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. So all the assembly began to murmur against the chieftains.","At this all the chieftains said to the entire assembly: “Since we swore an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel, we are not allowed to hurt them.","This is what we will do: We will let them live, so that there is no indignation against us because of the oath that we swore to them.”","And the chieftains added: “Let them live, but let them become gatherers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly.” This is what the chieftains promised them.","Joshua now called them and said to them: “Why did you trick us by saying, ‘We are from a place very far away from you,’ when you really live right among us?","From now on you are cursed, and you will always occupy a slave’s position as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”","They answered Joshua: “It was because your servants were plainly told that Jehovah your God had commanded Moses his servant to give you all the land and to annihilate all its inhabitants from before you. So we were afraid for our lives  because of you, and that is why we did this.","Now we are at your mercy.  Do to us whatever you think is good and right.”","And that is what he did with them; he saved them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill them.","But that day Joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar at the place that He should choose, and they remain so to this day."],["As soon as King A·doʹni-zeʹdek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Aʹi and devoted it to destruction, doing to Aʹi and its king just as he had done to Jerʹi·cho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibʹe·on had made peace with Israel and remained among them,","he was greatly alarmed, because Gibʹe·on was a great city, like one of the royal cities. It was greater than Aʹi, and all its men were warriors.","So A·doʹni-zeʹdek king of Jerusalem sent this message to Hoʹham king of Hebʹron, Piʹram king of Jarʹmuth, Ja·phiʹa king of Laʹchish, and Deʹbir king of Egʹlon:","“Come to my aid, and let us attack Gibʹe·on, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”","At this the five kings of the Amʹor·ites—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebʹron, the king of Jarʹmuth, the king of Laʹchish, and the king of Egʹlon—gathered together along with their armies, and they marched on and encamped against Gibʹe·on to fight against it.","Then the men of Gibʹe·on sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilʹgal: “Do not forsake  your slaves.

Not one of them will be able to stand against you.”","Joshua came against them by surprise after marching all night long from Gilʹgal.","Jehovah threw them into confusion before Israel, and they inflicted a great slaughter on them at Gibʹe·on, pursuing them by way of the ascent of Beth-hoʹron and striking them down as far as A·zeʹkah and Mak·keʹdah.","While they were fleeing from Israel and were on the descent of Beth-hoʹron, Jehovah hurled great hailstones from the sky on them as far as A·zeʹkah, and they perished. In fact, more died from the hail than from the sword of the Israelites.","It was then, on the day that Jehovah routed the Amʹor·ites before the eyes of the Israelites, that Joshua said to Jehovah before Israel:","So the sun stood still and the moon did not move until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jaʹshar? The sun stood still in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to set for about a whole day.","There has never been a day like that one, either before it or after it, when Jehovah listened to the voice of a man, for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.","After that Joshua together with all Israel returned to the camp at Gilʹgal.","Meanwhile, the five kings fled and hid in the cave at Mak·keʹdah.","Then it was reported to Joshua: “The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Mak·keʹdah.”","So Joshua said: “Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and assign men to guard them.","But the rest of you should not stop. Pursue your enemies and strike them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities, for Jehovah your  God has given them into your hands.”","After Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great slaughter on them, to the point of wiping them out except for some survivors who escaped and entered into the fortified cities,","all the people returned safely to Joshua at the camp at Mak·keʹdah. Not a man dared to utter a word  against the Israelites.","Then Joshua said: “Open the mouth of the cave and bring the five kings out of the cave to me.”","So they brought to him from the cave these five kings: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebʹron, the king of Jarʹmuth, the king of Laʹchish, and the king of Egʹlon.","When they brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men who had gone with him: “Come forward. Place your feet on the backs of the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on the backs of their necks.","Then Joshua said to them: “Do not be afraid or be terrified. Be courageous and strong, for this is what Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you are fighting.”","Then Joshua struck them and put them to death and hung them on five stakes,  and they remained hanging on the stakes until the evening.","At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down off the stakes and thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves. Then large stones were placed at the mouth of the cave, and these remain to this very day.","Joshua captured Mak·keʹdah on that day and struck it with the sword.

The God of gods, Jehovah! He knows, and Israel will also know. If we were rebellious and unfaithful to Jehovah, do not spare us this day.","If we built ourselves an altar to turn back from following Jehovah and to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, and communion sacrifices on it, Jehovah will exact the penalty.","No, it was because of another concern that we did this, for we said, ‘In the future, your sons will say to our sons: “What do you have to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?","Jehovah has put the Jordan as a boundary between us and you, the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites. You have no share in Jehovah.” And your sons will hinder our sons from worshipping  Jehovah.’","“So we said, ‘Let us by all means take action by building an altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices,","but to be a witness between you and us and our descendants  after us that we will carry out our service to Jehovah before him with our burnt offerings and our sacrifices and our communion sacrifices, so that your sons may not say to our sons in the future: “You have no share in Jehovah.”’","So we said, ‘If they should say that to us and to our descendants  in the future, we will then say: “See the replica of Jehovah’s altar that our forefathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but to be a witness between you and us.”’","It is unthinkable for us to rebel against Jehovah and to turn back today from following Jehovah by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrifices, other than the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle!”","When Phinʹe·has the priest, the chieftains of the assembly, and the heads of the thousands  of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of Reuʹben, Gad, and Ma·nasʹseh spoke, they were satisfied.","So Phinʹe·has the son of El·e·aʹzar the priest said to the descendants of Reuʹben, Gad, and Ma·nasʹseh: “Today we know that Jehovah is among us, because you have not committed this act of unfaithfulness against Jehovah. Now you  have saved the Israelites out of the hand of Jehovah.”","Then Phinʹe·has the son of El·e·aʹzar the priest and the chieftains returned from the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites in the land of Gilʹe·ad to the land of Caʹnaan, and they brought back word to the other Israelites.","And the Israelites were satisfied with the report. The Israelites then praised God, and they said nothing more about going to war against the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites to destroy the land in which they were dwelling.","So the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites named the altar,  because “it is a witness between us that Jehovah is the true God.”"],["Many days after Jehovah had given Israel rest from all its surrounding enemies, when Joshua was old and advanced in years,","Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders, its heads, its judges, and its officers, and he said to them: “I have grown old; I am advanced in years.","And you have seen for yourselves all that Jehovah your God did to all these nations in your behalf because Jehovah your God was the one who was fighting for you.","See, I assigned to you by lot  the land of the nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes, as well as that of all the nations that I destroyed, from the Jordan to the Great Sea  on the west.","And Jehovah your God was the one who kept thrusting them away from before you, and he drove them out  for you, and you took possession of their land, just as Jehovah your God promised you.","“Now you must be very courageous to observe and carry out all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses by never deviating from it to the right or to the left,","by never mingling with these nations that remain with you. You must not even mention the names of their gods nor swear by them, and you must never serve them nor bow down to them.","But you must stick to Jehovah your God, just as you have done down to this day.","Jehovah will drive away great and mighty nations from before you, for not a man has been able to stand before you to this day.","Just one man of you will chase a thousand, because Jehovah your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you.","So be on guard constantly  by loving Jehovah your God.","“But if you should turn back at all and stick to what is left of these nations that remain with you and you form marriage alliances  with them and associate with them and they with you,","you should know for sure that Jehovah your God will not continue to drive out  these nations for you. They will become a trap and a snare and a scourge on your flanks and thorns in your eyes until you have perished from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you.","“Now look! I am about to die,  and you well know with all your heart and with all your soul  that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.","But just as all  the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you have come upon you, so Jehovah will bring upon you all the calamity that he promised  and will annihilate you from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you.","If you violate the covenant of Jehovah your God that he commanded you to keep and if you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you and you will quickly perish from the good land that he has given you.”"],["Joshua then assembled all the tribes of Israel together at Sheʹchem and summoned the elders of Israel, its heads, its judges, and its officers, and they stood before the true God.","Joshua said to all the people: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘It was on the other side of the River  that your forefathers lived a long time ago—Teʹrah the father of Abraham and the father of Naʹhor—and they used to serve other gods.","“‘In time I took your forefather Abraham from the other side of the River  and had him walk through all the land of Caʹnaan and made his offspring  many. I gave him Isaac;","then to Isaac I gave Jacob and Eʹsau. Later to Eʹsau I gave Mount Seʹir as his possession; and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.","I later sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did among them, and then I brought you out.","When I was bringing your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea, the Egyptians were chasing after your fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen as far as the Red Sea.","They began to cry out to Jehovah, so he placed a darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea over them and covered them, and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelled in the wilderness many years.","“‘And I brought you to the land of the Amʹor·ites who were dwelling on the other side  of the Jordan, and they fought against you. But I gave them into your hand so that you could take possession of their land, and I annihilated them from before you.","Then Baʹlak son of Zipʹpor, the king of Moʹab, rose up and fought against Israel. So he summoned Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor to curse you.","But I would not listen to Baʹlaam. So he blessed you repeatedly, and I rescued you from his hand.","“‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jerʹi·cho. And the leaders  of Jerʹi·cho, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Girʹga·shites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites fought against you, but I gave them into your hand.","So I sent the feeling of dejection  ahead of you, and it drove them out from before you—two kings of the Amʹor·ites. It was not by your sword and not by your bow.","Thus I gave you a land for which you had not toiled and cities that you had not built, and you settled in them. You are eating from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’","“Therefore, fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity  and faithfulness,  and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the  River  and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.","Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River  or the gods of the Amʹor·ites in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.”","At this the people answered: “It is unthinkable for us to abandon Jehovah and to serve other gods.","It is Jehovah our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us the entire way in which we walked and among all the peoples through whom we passed.","Jehovah drove out all the peoples, including the Amʹor·ites, who lived in the land before us. Therefore, we too will serve Jehovah, because he is our God.”","Then Joshua said to the people: “You are not able to serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God; he is a God who requires exclusive devotion.

This stone will serve as a witness against us, because it has heard everything Jehovah said to us, and it will serve as a witness against you, so that you may not deny your God.”","With that Joshua sent the people away, each one to his inheritance.","After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of 110.","So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timʹnath-seʹrah, which is in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, north of Mount Gaʹash.","Israel continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all of Jehovah’s deeds in behalf of Israel.","The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Sheʹchem in the portion of the field that Jacob had acquired from the sons of Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father, for 100 pieces of money; and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.","Also, El·e·aʹzar the son of Aaron died.

Look! I am giving  the land into his hand.”","Then Judah said to his brother Simʹe·on: “Come up with me into my assigned territory  to fight against the Caʹnaan·ites. Then I will go with you into your assigned territory.” So Simʹe·on went with him.","When Judah went up, Jehovah gave the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites into their hands, and they defeated 10,000 men in Beʹzek.","They found A·doʹni-beʹzek in Beʹzek, and there they fought against him and defeated the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites.","When A·doʹni-beʹzek fled, they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.","Then A·doʹni-beʹzek said: “There are 70 kings whose thumbs and big toes were cut off and who are picking up food under my table. Just as I have done, so God has repaid me.” After that they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.","Furthermore, the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it; they struck it with the sword and set the city on fire.","Afterward, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the mountainous region and the Negʹeb and the She·pheʹlah.","So Judah marched against the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Hebʹron (the name of Hebʹron was previously Kirʹi·ath-arʹba), and they struck down Sheʹshai, A·hiʹman, and Talʹmai.","They marched from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir. (The name of Deʹbir was previously Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.)","Then Caʹleb said: “To the man who strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achʹsah as a wife.”","And Othʹni·el the son of Keʹnaz, Caʹleb’s younger brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah as a wife.","While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey.  Caʹleb asked her: “What do you want?”","She said to him: “Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south;  give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim.”  So Caʹleb gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth.","And the descendants of the Kenʹite, Moses’ father-in-law, came up from the city of palm trees with the people of Judah to the wilderness of Judah south of Aʹrad. They went there and settled among the people.","But Judah marched on with his brother Simʹe·on, and they attacked the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting Zeʹphath and devoted it to destruction. So they named the city Horʹmah.","Then Judah captured Gazʹa and its territory, Ashʹke·lon and its territory, and Ekʹron and its territory.","Jehovah was with Judah, and they took possession of the mountainous region, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain,  because they had war chariots with iron scythes.","They gave Hebʹron to Caʹleb, just as Moses had promised, and he drove out from there the three sons of Aʹnak.","But the Benʹja·min·ites did not drive out the Jebʹu·sites inhabiting Jerusalem, so the Jebʹu·sites continue dwelling with the Benʹja·min·ites in Jerusalem down to this day.","Meantime, the house of Joseph went up against Bethʹel, and Jehovah was with them.","The house of Joseph was spying on Bethʹel (incidentally, the name of the city was previously Luz),","and the spies saw a man going out of the city. So they said to him: “Show us, please, the way into the city, and we will treat you kindly.”","So the man showed them the way into the city, and they struck the city with the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free.","The man went to the land of the Hitʹtites and built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.","Ma·nasʹseh did not take possession of Beth-sheʹan and its dependent  towns, Taʹa·nach and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Ibʹle·am and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Me·gidʹdo and its dependent towns. The Caʹnaan·ites persisted in dwelling in this land.","When Israel grew stronger, they subjected the Caʹnaan·ites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.","Nor did Eʹphra·im drive out the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Geʹzer. The Caʹnaan·ites continued to dwell among them in Geʹzer.","Zebʹu·lun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitʹron and the inhabitants of Naʹha·lol. The Caʹnaan·ites continued to dwell among them and were subjected to forced labor.","Ashʹer did not drive out the inhabitants of Acʹco and the inhabitants of Siʹdon, Ahʹlab, Achʹzib, Helʹbah, Aʹphik, and Reʹhob.","So the Ashʹer·ites continued to dwell among the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the land, because they did not drive them out.","Naphʹta·li did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh and the inhabitants of Beth-aʹnath, but they continued to dwell among the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the land. The inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh and Beth-aʹnath became forced laborers for them.","The Amʹor·ites confined the Danʹites to the mountainous region, for they would not let them come down into the plain.","So the Amʹor·ites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heʹres, Aiʹja·lon, and Sha·alʹbim.

Furthermore, I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.","For your part, you must not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land and you should pull down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my voice. Why have you done this?","That is why I also said, ‘I will not drive them away from before you, and they will ensnare you, and their gods will lure you away.’”","When Jehovah’s angel spoke these words to all the Israelites,  the people began to weep loudly.","So they named that place Boʹchim,  and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.","When Joshua sent the people away, each of the Israelites went to his inheritance to take possession of the land.","The people continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had seen all of Jehovah’s great deeds in behalf of Israel.","Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of 110.","So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timʹnath-heʹres, in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, north of Mount Gaʹash.","All that generation were gathered to their ancestors,  and another generation arose after them that did not know Jehovah or what he had done for Israel.","So the Israelites did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and served  the Baʹals.","Thus they abandoned Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. And they followed other gods, the gods of the peoples who were all around them, and they bowed down to them and offended Jehovah.","They abandoned Jehovah and served Baʹal and the Ashʹto·reth images.","At this Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel, so he handed them over to plunderers who pillaged them. He sold them into the hand of the enemies around them, and they were no longer able to hold their own against their enemies.","Wherever they went, the hand of Jehovah was against them, bringing disaster on them, just as Jehovah had said and just as Jehovah had sworn to them, and they were in great distress.","So Jehovah would raise up judges who would save them from the hand of their plunderers.","But they refused to listen even to the judges and would prostitute themselves to other gods and bow down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their forefathers had walked, those who had obeyed the commandments of Jehovah. They failed to do that.","Whenever Jehovah did raise up judges for them, Jehovah would be with the judge and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity  over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them and those who were treating them abusively.","But when the judge died, they would again act more corruptly than their fathers by following other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not abandon their practices and their stubborn behavior.","Finally Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel, and he said: “Because this nation has violated my covenant that I commanded their forefathers and they have disobeyed me,","I for my part will not drive out from before them even one of the nations that Joshua left behind when he died.","This is to test whether Israel will keep Jehovah’s way by walking in it as their fathers did.”","So Jehovah allowed these nations to remain. He did not drive them out quickly, and he did not give them into Joshua’s hand."],["These are the nations that Jehovah allowed to remain so that they could test all those of Israel who had not  experienced any of the wars of Caʹnaan","(this was so that succeeding generations of Israelites would experience war, those who had not experienced such things before):","the five lords of the Phi·lisʹtines, and all the Caʹnaan·ites, the Si·doʹni·ans, and the Hiʹvites inhabiting Mount Lebʹa·non from Mount Baʹal-herʹmon as far as Leʹbo-haʹmath.","They served as a means of testing Israel to determine whether Israel would obey Jehovah’s commandments that he had given their fathers through Moses.","So the Israelites lived among the Caʹnaan·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites.","They would take their daughters as wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they began serving their gods.","So the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, and they forgot Jehovah their God and were serving the Baʹals and the sacred poles.","At this Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cuʹshan-rish·a·thaʹim the king of Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a.  The Israelites served Cuʹshan-rish·a·thaʹim for eight years.","When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, Jehovah raised up a savior to rescue the Israelites, Othʹni·el the son of Keʹnaz, the younger brother of Caʹleb.","The spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he became the judge of Israel.

Then Othʹni·el the son of Keʹnaz died.","And once again the Israelites began doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. So Jehovah let Egʹlon the king of Moʹab prevail over Israel, because they did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.","Furthermore, he brought against them the Amʹmon·ites and the A·malʹek·ites. They attacked Israel and captured the city of palm trees.","The Israelites served Egʹlon the king of Moʹab for 18 years.","Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, so Jehovah raised up for them a savior, Eʹhud the son of Geʹra, a Benʹja·min·ite who was left-handed. In time the Israelites sent tribute through him to Egʹlon the king of Moʹab.","Meanwhile, Eʹhud made for himself a two-edged sword, a cubit  long, and he strapped it underneath his garment on his right thigh.","He then presented the tribute to Egʹlon the king of Moʹab. Now Egʹlon was a very fat man.","When Eʹhud finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.","But after reaching the carved images  at Gilʹgal, he himself went back and said: “I have a secret message for you, O king.” So the king said: “Silence!” With that all his attendants left him.","So Eʹhud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. Then Eʹhud said: “I have a message from God for you.” So he rose up from his throne.","Then Eʹhud drew the sword from his right thigh with his left hand and plunged it into his belly.","The handle went in after the blade, and the fat closed in over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and the fecal matter came out.","Eʹhud went out through the porch,  closing the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locking them.","After he left, the servants returned and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said: “He must be relieving himself  in the cool interior room.”","They kept waiting until they were embarrassed, but when they saw that he was still not opening the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them and saw their lord fallen to the floor  dead!","Eʹhud escaped while they were lingering, and he passed by the carved images  and made it safely to Se·iʹrah.","When he arrived, he sounded the horn in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im; and the Israelites went down out of the mountainous region, with him at their head.","Then he said to them: “Follow me, because Jehovah has given your enemies, the Moʹab·ites, into your hand.” So they followed him and captured the fords of the Jordan against the Moʹab·ites, and they did not allow anyone to cross.","At that time they struck down about 10,000 Moʹab·ites, all strong and valiant men; not a single one escaped.","So Moʹab was subdued on that day under Israel’s hand; and the land had rest  for 80 years.","After him was Shamʹgar the son of Aʹnath, who struck down 600 Phi·lisʹtine men with a cattle goad; he too saved Israel."],["But after Eʹhud died, the Israelites again did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.","So Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jaʹbin the king of Caʹnaan, who reigned in Haʹzor. The chief of his army was Sisʹe·ra, who lived in Ha·roʹsheth of the nations.","The Israelites cried out to Jehovah, because Jaʹbin  had 900 war chariots with iron scythes,  and he harshly oppressed the Israelites for 20 years.","Now Debʹo·rah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapʹpi·doth, was judging Israel at that time.","She used to sit under Debʹo·rah’s palm tree between Raʹmah and Bethʹel in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im; the Israelites would go up to her for judgment.","She sent for Baʹrak the son of A·binʹo·am out of Keʹdesh-naphʹta·li and said to him: “Has not Jehovah the God of Israel given the command? ‘Go and march to  Mount Taʹbor, and take 10,000 men of Naphʹta·li and Zebʹu·lun with you.","I will bring to you Sisʹe·ra, the chief of Jaʹbin’s army, along with his war chariots and his troops to the stream  of Kiʹshon, and I will give him into your hand.’”","At this Baʹrak said to her: “If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go.”","To this she said: “I will certainly go with you. However, the campaign you are going on will not bring you glory, for it will be into the hand of a woman that Jehovah will give Sisʹe·ra.” Then Debʹo·rah got up and went with Baʹrak to Keʹdesh.","Baʹrak summoned Zebʹu·lun and Naphʹta·li to Keʹdesh, and 10,000 men followed his steps. Debʹo·rah also went up with him.","Incidentally, Heʹber the Kenʹite had separated from the Kenʹites, the descendants of Hoʹbab, Moses’ father-in-law, and his tent was pitched near the big tree in Za·a·nanʹnim, which is at Keʹdesh.","They reported to Sisʹe·ra that Baʹrak the son of A·binʹo·am had gone up to Mount Taʹbor.","At once Sisʹe·ra assembled all his war chariots—900 chariots with iron scythes —and all the troops that were with him from Ha·roʹsheth of the nations to go to the stream  of Kiʹshon.","Debʹo·rah now said to Baʹrak: “Rise up, for this is the day that Jehovah will give Sisʹe·ra into your hand.

Finally Sisʹe·ra got down from his chariot and fled on foot.","Baʹrak chased after the war chariots and the army as far as Ha·roʹsheth of the nations. So Sisʹe·ra’s whole army fell by the sword; not even one remained.","But Sisʹe·ra fled on foot to the tent of Jaʹel the wife of Heʹber the Kenʹite, for there was peace between Jaʹbin the king of Haʹzor and the house of Heʹber the Kenʹite.","Then Jaʹel came out to meet Sisʹe·ra and said to him: “Come in, my lord, come in here. Do not be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.","Then he said to her: “Give me, please, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin bottle of milk and gave him a drink, after which she again covered him.","He told her: “Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anybody comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No!’”","But Jaʹel the wife of Heʹber took a tent pin and a hammer in her hand.

You must not fear the gods of the Amʹor·ites in whose land you are dwelling.” But you did not obey me.’”","Later Jehovah’s angel came and sat under the big tree that was in Ophʹrah, which belonged to Joʹash the Abi-ezʹrite. His son Gidʹe·on was beating out wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from Midʹi·an.","Jehovah’s angel appeared to him and said: “Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.”","At this Gidʹe·on said to him: “Pardon me, my lord, but if Jehovah is with us, why has all of this come upon us? Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us, saying, ‘Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?’ Now Jehovah has deserted us and given us into Midʹi·an’s hand.”","Jehovah faced him and said: “Go with the strength you have, and you will save Israel out of Midʹi·an’s hand. Is it not I who send you?”","Gidʹe·on answered him: “Pardon me, Jehovah. How can I save Israel? Look! My clan  is the least in Ma·nasʹseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father’s house.”","But Jehovah said to him: “Because I will be with you, you will strike down Midʹi·an as if they were one man.”","Then he said to him: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, show me a sign that you are the one speaking with me.","Please do not depart from here until I return with my gift and set it before you.” So he said: “I will stay here until you return.”","And Gidʹe·on went in and prepared a young goat and made unleavened bread from an eʹphah  of flour. He put the meat in the basket and the broth in the cooking pot; then he brought them out to him and served them under the big tree.","The angel of the true God now said to him: “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on the big rock there, and pour out the broth.” And he did so.","Then Jehovah’s angel stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread, and fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Jehovah’s angel then vanished from his sight.","Gidʹe·on now realized that it was Jehovah’s angel.","But Jehovah said to him: “Peace be with you. Have no fear; you will not die.”","So Gidʹe·on built an altar there to Jehovah, and it is called Je·hoʹvah-shaʹlom  down to this day. It is still in Ophʹrah of the Abi-ezʹrites.","That night Jehovah said to him: “Take the young bull that belongs to your father, the second young bull that is seven years old, and tear down the  altar of Baʹal that belongs to your father, and cut down the sacred pole  next to it.","After you build an altar to Jehovah your God on top of this stronghold with the row of stones, take the second young bull and offer it as a burnt offering on the pieces of wood from the sacred pole  that you cut down.”","So Gidʹe·on took ten men of his servants and did just as Jehovah told him. But he feared the household of his father and the men of the city too much to do it by day, so he did it at night.","When the men of the city got up early the next morning, they saw that the altar of Baʹal had been pulled down and the sacred pole  beside it had been cut down and the second young bull had been offered up on the altar that had been built.","They asked one another: “Who did this?” After they investigated, they said: “Gidʹe·on the son of Joʹash did this.”","So the men of the city said to Joʹash: “Bring your son out that he may die, because he pulled down the altar of Baʹal and cut down the sacred pole  next to it.”","Joʹash then said to all those who confronted him: “Do you have to defend Baʹal? Do you have to save him? Whoever defends him should be put to death this morning. If he is a god, let him defend himself, since someone pulled down his altar.”","And he called Gidʹe·on Jer·ub·baʹal  on that day, saying: “Let Baʹal defend himself, for someone has pulled down his altar.”","All Midʹi·an and Amʹa·lek and the Easterners joined forces; and they crossed over  into the Valley  of Jezʹre·el and camped.","Then Jehovah’s spirit came upon  Gidʹe·on and he sounded the horn, and the Abi-ezʹrites rallied behind him.","He sent out messengers through all of Ma·nasʹseh, and they too rallied behind him. He also sent out messengers through Ashʹer, Zebʹu·lun, and Naphʹta·li, and they came up to meet him.","Then Gidʹe·on said to the true God: “If you are saving Israel by means of me, just as you have promised,","here I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only but all the ground around it is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by means of me, just as you have promised.”","And that is how it happened. When he rose up early the next day and wrung the fleece, he squeezed off enough dew from the fleece to fill a large banquet bowl with water.","However, Gidʹe·on said to the true God: “Do not let your anger burn against me, but let me ask just once more. Let me, please, make just one more test with the fleece. Please let the fleece alone be dry while there is dew all over the ground.”","So that is what God did that night; only the fleece was dry, and there was dew all over the ground."],["Then Jer·ub·baʹal, that is, Gidʹe·on, and all the people with him rose early and encamped at the Spring of Haʹrod, while the camp of Midʹi·an was north of him at the hill of Moʹreh in the valley plain.","Jehovah now said to Gidʹe·on: “There are too many people with you for me to give Midʹi·an into their hand. Otherwise, Israel might  brag about itself against me and say, ‘My own hand saved me.’","Now, please, announce in the presence of the people: ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return home.’” So Gidʹe·on put them to the test. With that, 22,000 of the people returned home, and 10,000 remained.","Still Jehovah said to Gidʹe·on: “There are yet too many people. Have them go down to the water so that I may test them for you there. When I say to you, ‘This one will go with you,’ he will go with you, but when I say to you, ‘This one will not go along with you,’ he will not go along.”","So he took the people down to the water.","The number of those lapping up the water, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men. The rest of the people bent down on their knees to drink.","Jehovah now said to Gidʹe·on: “I will save you with the 300 men who lapped the water, and I will give Midʹi·an into your hand. But let all the other people go back home.”","So after they took the provisions and the horns from the people, he sent all the other men of Israel back home, and he kept only the 300 men. The camp of Midʹi·an was below him in the valley plain.","During that night, Jehovah said to him: “Get up, attack the camp, for I have given it into your hand.","But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Puʹrah your attendant.","Listen to what they say, and afterward you will have the courage  to attack the camp.” At that he and Puʹrah his attendant went down to the edge of the encamped army.","Now Midʹi·an and Amʹa·lek and all the Easterners covered the valley plain like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were without number, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore.","Gidʹe·on now came, and there was a man relating a dream to his companion, and he said: “This is the dream I had. There was a round loaf of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midʹi·an. It came to a tent and struck it so hard that it collapsed. Yes, it turned the tent upside down, and the tent fell flat.”","At this his companion said: “This can only be the sword of Gidʹe·on the son of Joʹash, a man of Israel. God has given Midʹi·an and all the camp into his hand.”","As soon as Gidʹe·on heard him relate the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down to worship. After that he returned to the camp of Israel and said: “Get up, for Jehovah has given the camp of Midʹi·an into your hand.”","Then he divided the 300 men into three bands and gave all of them horns and large empty jars with torches inside the jars.","Then he said to them: “Watch me and do exactly what I do. When I come to the edge of the camp, you should do just as I do.","When I blow the horn, I and all who are with me, you also must blow the horns all around the camp and shout, ‘For Jehovah and for Gidʹe·on!’”","Gidʹe·on and the 100 men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the start of the middle night watch,  just after the sentries were posted. They blew the horns and  smashed the large water jars that were in their hands.","So the three bands blew the horns and shattered the large jars. They held the torches in their left hands and blew the horns in their right hands and they called out: “The sword of Jehovah and of Gidʹe·on!”","All the while each man stood in his place all around the camp, and the whole army ran away, shouting as they fled.","The 300 continued to blow the horns, and Jehovah turned the sword of each one against the other throughout the camp; and the army fled as far as Beth-shitʹtah, on to Zerʹe·rah, as far as the outskirts of Aʹbel-me·hoʹlah by Tabʹbath.","And the men of Israel were called together from Naphʹta·li, Ashʹer, and all of Ma·nasʹseh, and they chased after Midʹi·an.","Gidʹe·on sent messengers into all the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, saying: “Go down to attack Midʹi·an, and capture the access to the waters as far as Beth-barʹah and the Jordan.” So all the men of Eʹphra·im were gathered together, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barʹah and the Jordan.","They also captured the two princes of Midʹi·an, Oʹreb and Zeʹeb; they killed Oʹreb on the rock of Oʹreb, and they killed Zeʹeb at the winepress of Zeʹeb. They kept on pursuing Midʹi·an, and they brought the heads of Oʹreb and Zeʹeb to Gidʹe·on in the region of the Jordan."],["Then the men of Eʹphra·im said to him: “What have you done to us? Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midʹi·an?” And they quarreled bitterly with him.","But he said to them: “What have I done compared with you? Are not the gleanings of Eʹphra·im better than the grape harvest of Abi-eʹzer?","It was into your hand that God gave Midʹi·an’s princes Oʹreb and Zeʹeb, and what have I done compared with you?” When he spoke this way,  they calmed down.","Gidʹe·on then came to the Jordan and crossed it. He and the 300 men with him were tired, but they kept up the pursuit.","So he said to the men of Sucʹcoth: “Please give loaves of bread to the people following me, for they are tired and I am chasing after Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna, the kings of Midʹi·an.”","But the princes of Sucʹcoth said: “Are the palms of Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your army?”","At this Gidʹe·on said: “Just for that, when Jehovah gives Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna into my hand, I will give you a thrashing with the thorns and the briars of the wilderness.”","And he went up from there to Pe·nuʹel and made the same request, but the men of Pe·nuʹel gave him the same answer as the men of Sucʹcoth.","So he said also to the men of Pe·nuʹel: “When I return in peace, I will pull down this tower.”","Now Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna were in Karʹkor with their armies, about 15,000 men. These were all who remained of the entire army of the Easterners, for 120,000 men armed with swords had fallen.","Gidʹe·on continued up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Noʹbah and Jogʹbe·hah and attacked the camp, which was off guard.","When Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna fled, he pursued and captured the two Midʹi·an·ite kings, Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna, throwing the whole camp into a panic.","Gidʹe·on the son of Joʹash then returned from the war by way of the pass that goes up to Heʹres.","En route he captured and interrogated a young man from Sucʹcoth. So the young man wrote out for him the names of the princes and elders of Sucʹcoth, 77 men.","With that he went to the men of Sucʹcoth and said: “Here are Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the palms of Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your exhausted men?’”","Then he took the elders of the city and with thorns and briars of the wilderness, he taught the men of Sucʹcoth a lesson.","And he pulled down the tower of Pe·nuʹel and killed the men of the city.","He asked Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna: “What sort of men did you kill in Taʹbor?” To this they said: “They were like you, each one looked like the son of a king.”","At that he said: “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As surely as Jehovah lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not have to kill you.”","Then he said to Jeʹther his firstborn: “Get up, kill them.” But the young man did not draw his sword; he was afraid, for he was still a young man.","So Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna said: “Get up yourself and slay us, for a man is judged by his mightiness.”  So Gidʹe·on got up and killed Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna and took the crescent-shaped ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.","Later the men of Israel said to Gidʹe·on: “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson as well, for you saved us out of the hand of Midʹi·an.”","But Gidʹe·on said to them: “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. Jehovah is the one who will rule over you.”","Gidʹe·on continued: “Let me make one request of you: that each of you give me a nose ring from his spoil.” (For they had gold nose rings because they were Ishʹma·el·ites.)","They replied: “We will surely give them.” With that they spread out a robe and each man threw a nose ring from his spoil on it.","The weight of the gold nose rings that he had requested amounted to 1,700 gold shekels,  besides the crescent-shaped ornaments, the pendants, the purple wool garments worn by the kings of Midʹi·an, and the necklaces from the camels.","Gidʹe·on made it into an ephʹod and exhibited it in his city Ophʹrah; and all Israel committed spiritual prostitution with it there, and it served as a snare to Gidʹe·on and to his household.","Thus Midʹi·an was subdued before the Israelites, and they did not challenge them  again; and the land had rest  for 40 years in the days of Gidʹe·on.","So Jer·ub·baʹal the son of Joʹash returned to his home and stayed there.","Gidʹe·on became father to 70 sons,  for he had many wives.","His concubine in Sheʹchem also bore him a son, and he named him A·bimʹe·lech.","And Gidʹe·on the son of Joʹash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joʹash his father in Ophʹrah of the Abi-ezʹrites.","As soon as Gidʹe·on died, the Israelites again committed  spiritual prostitution with the Baʹals, and they appointed Baʹal-beʹrith as their god.","The Israelites did not remember Jehovah their God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies around them;","nor did they show loyal love toward the household of Jer·ub·baʹal, that is Gidʹe·on, in return for all the good that he had done for Israel."],["In time A·bimʹe·lech the son of Jer·ub·baʹal went to his mother’s brothers in Sheʹchem, and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather:","“Please ask all the leaders  of Sheʹchem, ‘Which is better for you, for all 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you? And remember that I am your own bone and flesh.’”","So his mother’s brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of Sheʹchem, and their hearts were inclined to follow A·bimʹe·lech, for they said: “He is our own brother.”","Then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house  of Baʹal-beʹrith, and A·bimʹe·lech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him.","After that he went to his father’s house at Ophʹrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jer·ub·baʹal, 70 men, on one stone. The only survivor was Joʹtham, the youngest son of Jer·ub·baʹal, because he hid.","Then all the leaders of Sheʹchem and all Beth-milʹlo gathered together and made A·bimʹe·lech king, close by the big tree, by the pillar that was in Sheʹchem.","When they reported it to Joʹtham, he at once went and stood on the top of Mount Gerʹi·zim and called out in a loud voice to them: “Listen to me, you leaders of Sheʹchem, and then God will listen to you.","“Once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘Rule over us.’","But the olive tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my oil,  which they use to glorify God and men, to go and wave over the other trees?’","Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and rule over us.’","But the fig tree said to them, ‘Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees?’","Next the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and rule over us.’","The vine replied to them, ‘Must I give up my new wine that makes God and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees?’","Finally all the other trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and rule over us.’","At this the bramble said to the trees, ‘If you are really anointing me as king over you, come and seek refuge under my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebʹa·non.’","“Now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making A·bimʹe·lech king, and have you shown goodness toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household, and have you treated him as he deserves?","When my father fought for you, he risked his life  to save you from Midʹi·an’s hand.","But today you have risen up against my father’s household and killed his sons, 70 men, on one stone. Then you made A·bimʹe·lech, the son of his slave girl, king over the leaders of Sheʹchem just because he is your brother.","Yes, if you are acting sincerely and honorably  toward Jer·ub·baʹal and his household this day, rejoice over A·bimʹe·lech and let him also rejoice over you.","But if not, may fire come out of A·bimʹe·lech and consume the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo, and may fire come out of the leaders of Sheʹchem and Beth-milʹlo and consume A·bimʹe·lech.”","Then Joʹtham fled and escaped to Beʹer, and he lived there because of his brother A·bimʹe·lech.","A·bimʹe·lech ruled  over Israel for three years.","Then God let hostility develop  between A·bimʹe·lech and the leaders of Sheʹchem, and they dealt treacherously with A·bimʹe·lech.","This was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of Jer·ub·baʹal might be avenged, so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother A·bimʹe·lech for killing them and on the leaders of Sheʹchem for helping him to kill his brothers.","So the leaders of Sheʹchem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops, and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road. In time it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech.","Then Gaʹal son of Eʹbed and his brothers crossed over into Sheʹchem, and the leaders of Sheʹchem put their trust in him.","They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them out, and held a festival, after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed A·bimʹe·lech.","Then Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed said: “Who is A·bimʹe·lech, and who is Sheʹchem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jer·ub·baʹal, and is not Zeʹbul his commissioner? Serve the men of Haʹmor, Sheʹchem’s father! But why should we serve him?","If only this people were under my command, I would depose A·bimʹe·lech.” Then he said to A·bimʹe·lech: “Increase your army and come out.”","When Zeʹbul the prince of the city heard the words of Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed, his anger blazed.","So he secretly  sent messengers to A·bimʹe·lech, saying: “Look! Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed and his brothers are now in Sheʹchem, and here they are inciting the city against you.","Now come up by night, you and your men, and lie in wait in the field.","As soon as the sun rises in the morning, you should get up early and attack the city; and when he and his men come out against you, do whatever you can to defeat him.”","So A·bimʹe·lech and all the people with him rose up by night, and in four bands they lay in wait against Sheʹchem.","When Gaʹal the son of Eʹbed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, A·bimʹe·lech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.","When Gaʹal saw the people, he said to Zeʹbul: “Look! There are people coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zeʹbul said to him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”","Gaʹal later said: “Look! People are coming down from the center of the land, and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of Me·onʹe·nim.”","Zeʹbul replied to him: “Where now is your boast, ‘Who is A·bimʹe·lech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you rejected? Go out now and fight against them.”","So Gaʹal went out at the head of the leaders of Sheʹchem  and fought against A·bimʹe·lech.","A·bimʹe·lech pursued him, and Gaʹal fled from him, and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate.","And A·bimʹe·lech continued to dwell in A·ruʹmah, and Zeʹbul drove Gaʹal and his brothers out of Sheʹchem.","The next day the people went out into the field, and A·bimʹe·lech was told about it.","So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field. When he saw the people going out of the city, he attacked them and struck them down.","A·bimʹe·lech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate, while two bands attacked all who were in the field, and they struck them down.","A·bimʹe·lech fought against the city all that day and captured it. He killed the people in it, and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt.","When all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem heard about this, they immediately went to the vault  of the house  of El-beʹrith.","As soon as it was reported to A·bimʹe·lech that all the leaders of the tower of Sheʹchem had gathered together,","A·bimʹe·lech and all the men with him went up Mount Zalʹmon. A·bimʹe·lech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him: “What you saw me do, hurry and do the same!”","So all the people also cut off branches and followed A·bimʹe·lech. Then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire. So all the people of the tower of Sheʹchem also died, about 1,000 men and women.","A·bimʹe·lech then went to Theʹbez; he camped against Theʹbez and captured it.","There was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there. They shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower.","A·bimʹe·lech made his way to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire.","Then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on A·bimʹe·lech’s head and crushed his skull.","He quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him: “Draw your sword and put me to death, so that they may not say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his attendant ran him through, and he died.","When the men of Israel saw that A·bimʹe·lech was dead, they all went back home.","Thus God repaid A·bimʹe·lech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers.","God also made all the evil of the men of Sheʹchem come back on their own heads. So the curse of Joʹtham the son of Jer·ub·baʹal came upon them."],["After A·bimʹe·lech, Toʹla the son of Puʹah, the son of Doʹdo, a man of Isʹsa·char, rose up to save Israel. He lived in Shaʹmir in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im.","He judged Israel for 23 years. Then he died and was buried in Shaʹmir.","After him Jaʹir the Gilʹe·ad·ite rose up and judged Israel for 22 years.","He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys, and they had 30 cities, which to this day are called Havʹvoth-jaʹir; they are in the land of Gilʹe·ad.","After that Jaʹir died and was buried in Kaʹmon.","Again the Israelites did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and they began to serve the Baʹals, the Ashʹto·reth images, the gods of Aʹram,  the gods of Siʹdon, the gods of Moʹab, the gods of the Amʹmon·ites, and the gods of the Phi·lisʹtines. They abandoned Jehovah and did not serve him.","Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Phi·lisʹtines and the Amʹmon·ites.","So they crushed and greatly oppressed the Israelites in that year—for 18 years they oppressed all the Israelites on the side of the Jordan that had been the land of the Amʹor·ites in Gilʹe·ad.","The Amʹmon·ites would also cross the Jordan to fight against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Eʹphra·im; and Israel was greatly distressed.","Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, saying: “We have sinned against you, for we abandoned our God and served the Baʹals.”","But Jehovah said to the Israelites: “Did I not save you from Egypt and from the Amʹor·ites, the Amʹmon·ites, the Phi·lisʹtines,","the Si·doʹni·ans, Amʹa·lek, and Midʹi·an when they oppressed you? When you cried out to me, I saved you out of their hand.","But you abandoned me and served other gods. That is why I will not save you again.","Go to the gods whom you have chosen and call for help. Let them save you in your time of distress.”","But the Israelites said to Jehovah: “We have sinned. Do to us whatever is good in your eyes. Only save us, please, this day.”","And they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Jehovah, so that he could no longer tolerate  Israel’s suffering.","In time the Amʹmon·ites were called together, and they pitched camp in Gilʹe·ad. So the Israelites gathered together and pitched camp in Mizʹpah.","The people and the princes of Gilʹe·ad said to one another: “Who will take the lead in fighting against the Amʹmon·ites? Let him become the chief over all the inhabitants of Gilʹe·ad.”"],["Now Jephʹthah the Gilʹe·ad·ite was a mighty warrior; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilʹe·ad was Jephʹthah’s father.","But Gilʹe·ad’s wife also bore him sons. When the sons of his wife grew up, they drove Jephʹthah out and said to him: “You will have no inheritance in our father’s household, for you are the son of another woman.”","So Jephʹthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob. And idle men joined company with Jephʹthah, and they followed him.","After a while, the Amʹmon·ites fought against Israel.","And when the Amʹmon·ites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilʹe·ad immediately went to bring Jephʹthah back from the land of Tob.","They said to Jephʹthah: “Come and serve as our commander, so that we can fight against the Amʹmon·ites.”","But Jephʹthah said to the elders of Gilʹe·ad: “Was it not you who hated me so much that you drove me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”","At this the elders of Gilʹe·ad said to Jephʹthah: “That is why now we have returned to you. If you go with us and fight against the Amʹmon·ites, you will become our leader over all the inhabitants of Gilʹe·ad.”","So Jephʹthah said to the elders of Gilʹe·ad: “If you bring me back to fight against the Amʹmon·ites and Jehovah defeats them for  me, then I will indeed become your leader!”","The elders of Gilʹe·ad said to Jephʹthah: “Let Jehovah be the witness  between us if we do not do as you say.”","So Jephʹthah went with the elders of Gilʹe·ad, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephʹthah repeated all his words before Jehovah in Mizʹpah.","Jephʹthah then sent messengers to the king of the Amʹmon·ites, saying: “What do you have against me  that you have come to attack my land?”","So the king of the Amʹmon·ites said to the messengers of Jephʹthah: “It is because Israel took my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arʹnon to the Jabʹbok and as far as the Jordan. Now return it peaceably.”","But Jephʹthah sent messengers back to the king of the Amʹmon·ites","to say to him:","for when they came up out of Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kaʹdesh.","Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Eʹdom, saying: “Please let us pass through your land,” but the king of Eʹdom did not listen. Also to the king of Moʹab they sent word, but he did not consent. So Israel kept dwelling in Kaʹdesh.","When they walked through the wilderness, they bypassed the land of Eʹdom and the land of Moʹab. They traveled east of the land of Moʹab and camped in the region of the Arʹnon; they did not come within the boundary of Moʹab, for the Arʹnon was the boundary of Moʹab.","“‘After that Israel sent messengers to Siʹhon king of the Amʹor·ites, king of Heshʹbon, and Israel said to him: “Please let us pass through your land to our own place.”","But Siʹhon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory, so Siʹhon gathered all his people together and encamped in Jaʹhaz and fought against Israel.","At this Jehovah the God of Israel gave Siʹhon and all his people into Israel’s hand, so that they defeated them and Israel took possession of all the land of the Amʹor·ites, the inhabitants of that land.","Thus they took possession of all the territory of the Amʹor·ites from the Arʹnon to the Jabʹbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.","“‘It was Jehovah the God of Israel who drove out the Amʹor·ites from before his people Israel, and now would you drive them out?","Do you not possess whatever your god Cheʹmosh gives you to possess? So everyone whom Jehovah our God has driven out from before us is the one we will drive out.","Now are you any better than Baʹlak the son of Zipʹpor, the king of Moʹab? Did he ever contend with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?","While Israel was dwelling in Heshʹbon and its dependent  towns and in A·roʹer and its dependent towns and in all the cities that are by the banks of the Arʹnon for 300 years, why did you never try to take them back during that time?","I have not sinned against you, but you are wrong to attack me. Let Jehovah the Judge be judge today between the people of Israel and the people of Amʹmon.’”","But the king of the Amʹmon·ites would not listen to the  message that Jephʹthah sent to him.","Jehovah’s spirit came upon Jephʹthah, and he passed through Gilʹe·ad and Ma·nasʹseh to go to Mizʹpeh of Gilʹe·ad, and from Mizʹpeh of Gilʹe·ad he continued on to the Amʹmon·ites.","Then Jephʹthah made a vow to Jehovah and said: “If you give the Amʹmon·ites into my hand,","then whoever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Amʹmon·ites will become Jehovah’s, and I will offer that one up as a burnt offering.”","So Jephʹthah went to fight against the Amʹmon·ites, and Jehovah gave them into his hand.","He struck them down with a very great slaughter from A·roʹer all the way to Minʹnith—20 cities—and as far as Aʹbel-kerʹa·mim. Thus the Amʹmon·ites were subdued before the Israelites.","Finally Jephʹthah came to his home in Mizʹpah, and look! his daughter was coming out to meet him, playing the tambourine and dancing! Now she was his one and only child. Besides her, he had neither son nor daughter.","When he saw her, he ripped his garments and said: “Oh no, my daughter! You have broken my heart,  for you have become the one I have banished. Now I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I am unable to turn back.”","But she said to him: “My father, if you have opened your mouth to Jehovah, do to me as you have promised, since Jehovah has executed vengeance for you upon your enemies, the Amʹmon·ites.”","She then said to her father: “Let this be done for me: Let me be alone for two months, and let me go away into the mountains, and let me weep over my virginity with my female companions.”","At this he said: “Go!” So he sent her away for two months, and she went to the mountains with her companions to weep over her virginity.","At the end of two months, she returned to her father, after which he carried out the vow he had made regarding her. She never had relations with a man. And it became a custom  in Israel:","From year to year, the young women of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jephʹthah the Gilʹe·ad·ite four days in the year."],["Then the men of Eʹphra·im were summoned, and they crossed over to Zaʹphon  and said to Jephʹthah: “Why did you not call us to go with you when you crossed over to fight against the Amʹmon·ites? We will burn your house down with you in it.”","But Jephʹthah said to them: “Along with my people, I was engaged in a great conflict with the Amʹmon·ites. I did call to you for help, but you did not save me from their hand.","When I saw that you would not save me, then I decided to risk my life  and go against the Amʹmon·ites, and Jehovah handed them over to me. So why have you come today to fight against me?”","Jephʹthah then gathered all the men of Gilʹe·ad, and they fought Eʹphra·im; the men of Gilʹe·ad defeated Eʹphra·im, who had said: “You are only fugitives from Eʹphra·im, you Gilʹe·ad·ites in Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh.”","Gilʹe·ad captured the fords of the Jordan ahead of Eʹphra·im; and when the men of Eʹphra·im  were trying to escape, they would say, “Let me cross over”; then the men of Gilʹe·ad would ask each one, “Are you an Eʹphra·im·ite?” When he would reply, “No!”","they would say to him, “Please say Shibʹbo·leth.” But he would say, “Sibʹbo·leth,” as he was unable to say the word correctly. Then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. So 42,000 Eʹphra·im·ites fell at that time.","Jephʹthah judged Israel for six years, after which Jephʹthah the Gilʹe·ad·ite died and was buried in his city in Gilʹe·ad.","Ibʹzan from Bethʹle·hem judged Israel after him.","He had 30 sons and 30 daughters. He sent his daughters to marry men outside his clan, and he brought in 30 women to marry his sons. He judged Israel for seven years.","Then Ibʹzan died and was buried in Bethʹle·hem.","After him Eʹlon the Zebʹu·lun·ite judged Israel; he judged Israel for ten years.","Then Eʹlon the Zebʹu·lun·ite died and was buried in Aiʹja·lon in the land of Zebʹu·lun.","After him Abʹdon the son of Hilʹlel the Pirʹa·thon·ite judged Israel.","He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years.","Then Abʹdon the son of Hilʹlel the Pirʹa·thon·ite died and was buried in Pirʹa·thon in the land of Eʹphra·im in the mountain of the A·malʹek·ite."],["Again the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines for 40 years.","Meanwhile, there was a man of Zoʹrah of the family of the Danʹites, whose name was Ma·noʹah. His wife was barren and childless.","In time Jehovah’s angel appeared to the woman and said to her: “Look, you are barren and childless. But you will conceive and give birth to a son.","Now be careful not to drink wine or anything alcoholic, and do not eat anything unclean.","Look! You will conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor should touch his head, because the child will be a Nazʹi·rite of God from birth,  and he will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","Then the woman went and told her husband: “A man of the true God came to me, and his appearance was like an angel of the true God, very awe-inspiring. I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name.","But he said to me, ‘Look! You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now do not drink wine or anything alcoholic, and do not eat anything unclean, because the child will be a Nazʹi·rite of God from birth  until the day of his death.’”","Ma·noʹah pleaded with Jehovah and said: “Pardon me, Jehovah. Please let the man of the true God whom you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with the child who will be born.”","So the true God listened to Ma·noʹah, and the angel of the true God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field; her husband Ma·noʹah was not with her.","The woman quickly ran and told her husband: “Look! The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”","Then Ma·noʹah got up and went with his wife. He came to the man and said to him: “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” He said: “I am.”","Then Ma·noʹah said: “May your words come true! What will be the  child’s manner of life, and what will be his work?”","So Jehovah’s angel said to Ma·noʹah: “Your wife should keep herself from everything that I mentioned to her.","She should not eat anything that the grapevine produces, she should not drink wine or anything alcoholic, and she should not eat anything unclean. Everything that I commanded her, let her observe.”","Ma·noʹah now said to Jehovah’s angel: “Please stay, and let us prepare a young goat for you.”","But Jehovah’s angel said to Ma·noʹah: “If I stay, I will not eat your food; but if you wish to present a burnt offering to Jehovah, you may offer it up.” Ma·noʹah did not know that he was Jehovah’s angel.","Then Ma·noʹah said to Jehovah’s angel: “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?”","However, Jehovah’s angel said to him: “Why are you asking about my name, seeing that it is a wonderful one?”","Then Ma·noʹah took the young goat and the grain offering and offered them on the rock to Jehovah. And He was doing something amazing while Ma·noʹah and his wife were looking on.","As the flame ascended from the altar heavenward, Jehovah’s angel ascended in the flame from the altar while Ma·noʹah and his wife were looking on. At once they fell with their faces to the ground.","Jehovah’s angel did not appear again to Ma·noʹah and his wife. Then Ma·noʹah realized that he was Jehovah’s angel.","Ma·noʹah then said to his wife: “We are sure to die, because it is God whom we have seen.”","But his wife said to him: “If Jehovah wanted to put us to death, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hand, he would not have shown us all these things, and he would not have told us any of these things.”","The woman later gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and as the boy grew, Jehovah continued to bless him.","In time Jehovah’s spirit started to impel him in Maʹha·neh-dan, between Zoʹrah and Eshʹta·ol."],["Then Samson went down to Timʹnah, and in Timʹnah he saw a Phi·lisʹtine woman.","So he went up and told his father and mother: “In Timʹnah a Phi·lisʹtine woman caught my eye, and I want you to get her for me as a wife.”","But his father and mother said to him: “Can you not find a woman among your relatives and among all our people? Must you go and take a wife from among the uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtines?” But Samson said to his father: “Get her for me, because she is the right one for me.”","His father and mother did not realize that this was from Jehovah, for He was looking for an opportunity against the Phi·lisʹtines, as the Phi·lisʹtines were ruling over Israel at that time.","So Samson went down with his father and mother to Timʹnah. When he reached the vineyards of Timʹnah, why look! a lion  came roaring at him.","Then Jehovah’s spirit empowered him, and he tore it in two, just as someone tears a young goat in two with his bare hands. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.","Then he went down and spoke to the woman, and she was still the right one in Samson’s eyes.","Later when he was going back to take her home, he turned aside to look at the dead body of the lion, and there in the lion’s carcass was a swarm of bees and honey.","So he scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he rejoined his father and mother, he gave them some to eat. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the carcass of a lion.","His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a banquet there, for that was what the young men used to do.","When they saw him, they brought 30 groomsmen to accompany him.","Then Samson said to them: “Please let me tell you a riddle. If during the seven days of the banquet you solve it and tell me the answer, I will have to give you 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing.","But if you are unable to tell me the answer, you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing.” They said: “Tell us your riddle; we want to hear it.”","So he said to them:","On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s wife: “Trick your husband so that he will tell us the answer to the riddle. Otherwise, we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Did you invite us here to take our possessions?”","So Samson’s wife wept over him and said: “You must hate me; you do not love me. You told a riddle to my people, but you have not told the answer to me.” At this he said to her: “Why, I have not told it even to my own father and mother! Should I tell it to you?”","But she kept weeping over him the rest of the seven-day banquet. He finally told her on the seventh day, because she had pressured him. Then she told her people the answer to the riddle.","So on the seventh day before the sun set,  the men of the city said to him:","Then Jehovah’s spirit empowered him, and he went down to Ashʹke·lon and struck down 30 of their men and took their clothing and gave the outfits to those who had answered the riddle. He was furious as he went back up to his father’s house.","Samson’s wife was then given to one of his groomsmen who had accompanied him."],["After a while, in the days of the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing a young goat. He said: “I wish to go in to my wife in the bedroom.”  But her father did not allow him to go in.","Her father said: “I thought, ‘You must surely hate her.’ So I gave her to your groomsman. Is not her younger sister more attractive than she is? Please, take her instead.”","However, Samson said to them: “This time I cannot be blamed by the Phi·lisʹtines for harming them.”","So Samson went and caught 300 foxes. Then he took torches, turned the foxes tail to  tail, and put one torch between each pair of tails.","Then he set fire to the torches and sent the foxes out into the fields of standing grain of the Phi·lisʹtines. He set on fire everything from sheaf to standing grain, as well as the vineyards and the olive groves.","The Phi·lisʹtines asked: “Who did this?” They were told: “It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timʹnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his groomsman.” At that the Phi·lisʹtines went up and burned her and her father with fire.","Then Samson said to them: “If this is how you act, I will not quit until I take revenge on you.”","Then he struck them down one after the other  with a great slaughter, after which he went down and stayed in a cave  of the crag Eʹtam.","Later the Phi·lisʹtines came up and camped in Judah and were tramping about in Leʹhi.","Then the men of Judah said: “Why have you come up against us?” to which they answered: “We have come up to capture  Samson, to do to him just as he did to us.”","So 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cave  of the crag Eʹtam and said to Samson: “Do you not know that the Phi·lisʹtines are ruling over us? So why have you done this to us?” He said to them: “As they did to me, so I did to them.”","But they said to him: “We have come to capture  you and to hand you over to the Phi·lisʹtines.” Then Samson said: “Swear to me that you yourselves will not assault me.”","They said to him: “No, we will only tie you and hand you over to them, but we will not put you to death.”","When he came to Leʹhi, the Phi·lisʹtines shouted triumphantly at meeting him. Then Jehovah’s spirit empowered him, and the ropes on his arms became like linen threads that were scorched with fire, and his fetters melted off his hands.","He now found a fresh jawbone of a male donkey; he reached out and grabbed it and struck down 1,000 men with it.","Then Samson said:","When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone away and called that place Raʹmath-leʹhi.","Then he became very thirsty, and he called on Jehovah and said: “It was you who gave this great salvation into the hand of your servant. But now am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”","So God split open a hollow that was in Leʹhi, and water flowed from it. When he drank, his spirit  returned and he revived. That is why he named the place En-hak·korʹe,  which is in Leʹhi to this day.","And he judged Israel in the days of the Phi·lisʹtines for 20 years."],["One time Samson went to Gazʹa and saw a prostitute there, and he went in to her.","The Gazʹites were told: “Samson has come here.” So they surrounded him and lay in ambush for him all night long in the city gate. They stayed quiet the whole night, saying  to themselves: “When daylight comes, we will kill him.”","However, Samson kept lying there until midnight. Then he got up at midnight and grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two side posts and pulled them out along with the bar. He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that faces Hebʹron.","After that he fell in love with a woman in the Valley  of Soʹrek whose name was De·liʹlah.","So the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines approached her and said: “Trick  him and find out what gives him such great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him and subdue him. For this we will each give you 1,100 silver pieces.”","De·liʹlah later said to Samson: “Please tell me where your great power comes from and what can be used to tie you and subdue you.”","Samson said to her: “If they tie me with seven fresh bowstrings  that have not been dried out, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.”","So the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried out, and she tied him with them.","Now they set an ambush in the inner room, and she called out to him: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” At that he tore apart the bowstrings, just as easily as a thread of flax  comes apart when it touches fire. The secret of his power did not become known.","Then De·liʹlah said to Samson: “Look! You have fooled me  and told me lies. Now tell me, please, what can be used to tie you.”","So he said to her: “If they tie me up with new ropes that have not been used for work, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.”","So De·liʹlah took new ropes and tied him with them and called out: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” (All the while the ambush was set in the inner room.) At that he tore them off his arms like threads.","After that De·liʹlah said to Samson: “Up until now you have fooled me and told me lies. Tell me what can be used to tie you.” Then he said to her: “If you weave the seven braids of my head with the warp thread.”","So she fixed them with a pin and called out to him: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” So he woke up from his sleep and pulled out the loom pin and the warp thread.","She now said to him: “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? These three times you have fooled me and have not told me the source of your great power.”","Because day after day she kept nagging him and pressuring him, he  was weary to the point of dying.","So he finally opened his heart to her, saying: “A razor has never touched my head, because I am a Nazʹi·rite of God from birth.  If I am shaved, my power will leave me and I will grow weak and become like all other men.”","When De·liʹlah saw that he had opened his heart to her, she immediately summoned the Phi·lisʹtine lords, saying: “Come up this time, for he has opened his heart to me.” So the Phi·lisʹtine lords came up to her, bringing the money with them.","She made him fall asleep on her knees; then she called the man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head. After that  she began to have control over him, for his power was leaving him.","Now she called out: “The Phi·lisʹtines are upon you, Samson!” He woke up from his sleep and said: “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that Jehovah had left him.","So the Phi·lisʹtines seized him and bored his eyes out. Then they brought him down to Gazʹa and bound him with two copper fetters, and he became a grinder of grain in the prison.","But the hair of his head started to grow back again after he had been shaved.","The Phi·lisʹtine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Daʹgon their god and to celebrate, for they were saying: “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand!”","When the people saw him, they praised their god and said: “Our god has given into our hand our enemy, the one who devastated our land and killed so many of us.”","Because their heart was cheerful, they said: “Call Samson to provide us some amusement.” So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them; they made him stand between the pillars.","Then Samson said to the boy holding him by the hand: “Let me feel the pillars that support the house, so that I can lean against them.”","(Incidentally, the house was full of men and women. All the Phi·lisʹtine lords were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women who were looking on while Samson provided amusement.)","Samson now called out to Jehovah: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, just this once, O God, and let me take revenge on the Phi·lisʹtines for one of my two eyes.”","Then Samson braced himself against the two middle pillars that supported the house, and he leaned on them with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other.","Samson called out: “Let me  die with the Phi·lisʹtines!” Then he pushed with all his might, and the house fell on the lords and all the people in it. So he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life.","Later his brothers and all his father’s family came down to take him back. They brought him up and buried him between Zoʹrah and Eshʹta·ol in the tomb of Ma·noʹah his father. He had judged Israel for 20 years."],["There was a man of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im named Miʹcah.","He said to his mother: “The 1,100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse, which I heard—look! the silver is with me. I was the one who took it.” At that his mother said: “May Jehovah bless my son.”","So he gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother, but his mother said: “I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue.  Now I give it back to you.”","After he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith. He made a carved image and a metal statue;  and they were put in Miʹcah’s house.","This man Miʹcah had a house of gods, and he made an ephʹod and teraphim statues  and installed  one of  his sons to serve as priest for him.","In those days, there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.","Now there was a young man of Bethʹle·hem in Judah who was of the family of Judah. He was a Levite who had been living there for a time.","The man left the city of Bethʹle·hem in Judah to find a place to live. While on his journey, he came to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to the house of Miʹcah.","Then Miʹcah said to him: “Where do you come from?” He replied: “I am a Levite from Bethʹle·hem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to live.”","So Miʹcah said to him: “Stay with me and serve as a father  and a priest for me. I will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food.” So the Levite went in.","Thus the Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.","Furthermore, Miʹcah installed  the Levite to serve as a priest for him, and he lived in the house of Miʹcah.","Then Miʹcah said: “Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, for the Levite has become my priest.”"],["In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danʹites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in, because until then they had not received an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.","The Danʹites sent five men from among their family, capable men from Zoʹrah and Eshʹta·ol, to spy out the land and to explore it. They said to them: “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to the house of Miʹcah, they spent the night there.","While they were near the house of Miʹcah, they recognized the voice  of the young Levite man, so they went over to him and asked: “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is keeping you here?”","He replied to them: “Thus and so Miʹcah did for me, and he hired me to serve as priest for him.”","Then they said to him: “Please ask God whether our journey will be successful.”","The priest said to them: “Go in peace. Jehovah is with you on your journey.”","So the five men went on and came to Laʹish. They saw how the people in it were dwelling in self-reliance in the manner of the Si·doʹni·ans. They were quiet and unsuspecting, and no oppressive conqueror was in the land to disturb them. They were far away from the Si·doʹni·ans, and they had no dealings with anyone else.","When they returned to their brothers at Zoʹrah and Eshʹta·ol, their brothers said to them: “How did it go?”","They replied: “Let us go up against them, for we have seen that the land is very good. Why are you hesitant? Do not delay to go in to take possession of the land.","When you arrive, you will find an unsuspecting people, and the land is spacious. God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.”","Then 600 men armed for battle from the family of the Danʹites departed from Zoʹrah and Eshʹta·ol.","They went up and camped at Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim in Judah. That is why  that place, which is west of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, is called Maʹha·neh-dan  to this day.","They went from there to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im and came to the house of Miʹcah.","Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laʹish said to their brothers: “Did you know that there are in these houses an ephʹod, teraphim statues,  a carved image, and a metal statue?  Think about what you should do.”","So they stopped there and came to the house of the young Levite man at the house of Miʹcah and asked how he was.","All the while the 600 men of Dan, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.","The five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside to take the carved image, the ephʹod, the teraphim statues,  and the metal image.  (The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed for battle.)","They went into the house of Miʹcah and took the carved image, the ephʹod, the teraphim statues,  and the metal image.  The priest said to them: “What are you doing?”","But they said to him: “Be quiet. Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us to be a father  and a priest for us. Which is better—for you to be a priest to the house of one man or to become a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?”","So the priest was satisfied, and he took the ephʹod, the teraphim statues,  and the carved image and went off with the people.","Then they turned to go on their way, putting the children, the livestock, and the valuable things ahead of them.","They had gone some distance away from the house of Miʹcah when the men who lived in the houses near the house of Miʹcah gathered together and caught up with the Danʹites.","When they cried out to the Danʹites, they turned to face them and said to Miʹcah: “What is the matter? Why have you been gathered together?”","So he said: “You have taken my gods that I made, and you have gone off with the priest too. What do I have left? How, then, can you ask me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”","The Danʹites replied: “Do not raise your voice against us; otherwise, angry men  may assault you, and that would cost you your life  and the lives  of your household.”","So the Danʹites went on their way; and Miʹcah, seeing that they were stronger than he was, turned and went back to his house.","After they took what Miʹcah had made, as well as his priest, they went to Laʹish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting. They struck them down with the sword and burned the city with fire.","There was no one to rescue it, for it was far from Siʹdon and they had no dealings with anyone else and it was in the valley plain  that belonged to Beth-reʹhob. Then they rebuilt the city and settled in it.","Furthermore, they named the city Dan after the name of their father, Dan, who was born to Israel. But Laʹish was the city’s former name.","After that the Danʹites set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonʹa·than the son of Gerʹshom, the son of Moses, and his sons became priests to the tribe of the Danʹites until the day that  the inhabitants of the land went into exile.","And they set up the carved image that Miʹcah had made, and it remained there all the days that the house of the true God was in Shiʹloh."],["In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite who was then living in a remote part of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im took a concubine from Bethʹle·hem in Judah as his wife.","But his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she left him to go to her father’s house at Bethʹle·hem in Judah. She remained there for four months.","Then her husband went after her to persuade her to come back; he had his male attendant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house. When her father saw him, he was glad to meet him.","So his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, convinced him to stay with him three days; and they would eat and drink, and he would spend the night there.","On the fourth day, when they got up early in the morning to go, the father of the young woman said to his son-in-law: “Eat something to give you strength,  and then you may go.”","So they sat down, and they both ate and drank together; after that the father of the young woman said to the man: “Please, stay overnight and enjoy yourself.”","When the man rose to go, his father-in-law kept begging him, so he stayed overnight again.","When he got up early in the morning on the fifth day to go, the father of the young woman said: “Please, eat something to give you strength.”  And they lingered until it was late in the day, and they both kept eating.","When the man rose to go with his concubine and his attendant, his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him: “Look, now! It is almost evening. Please, stay overnight. Here the day is coming to an end. Stay here overnight and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early for your journey and go to your home.”","However, the man did not want to stay another night, so he got up and traveled as far as Jeʹbus, that is, Jerusalem. He had with him the two saddled donkeys, his concubine, and his attendant.","When they were close to Jeʹbus, the daylight was nearly gone. So the attendant said to his master: “Should we stop at this city of the Jebʹu·sites and stay overnight here?”","But his master said to him: “We should not stop at a city of foreigners who are not Israelites. We will go on as far as Gibʹe·ah.”","Then he said to his attendant: “Come and let us try to reach one of those places; we will stay overnight either in Gibʹe·ah or in Raʹmah.”","So they went on their way, and the sun began to set when they were near Gibʹe·ah, which belongs to Benjamin.","So they stopped there and went in to stay overnight in Gibʹe·ah. Once inside, they sat down in the public square of the city, but nobody took them into his house to stay overnight.","Eventually that evening, an old man came in from his work in the field. He was from the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and he was living for a time in Gibʹe·ah; but the residents of the city were Benʹja·min·ites.","When he looked up and saw the traveler in the public square of the city, the old  man said: “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”","He replied: “We are traveling from Bethʹle·hem in Judah to a remote area of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, where I am from. I went to Bethʹle·hem in Judah, and I am going to the house of Jehovah,  but nobody is taking me into his house.","We have enough straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, the woman, and our attendant. There is nothing lacking.”","However, the old man said: “May you have peace! Let me take care of anything you need. Just do not stay overnight in the public square.”","So he brought him into his house and gave feed  to the donkeys. Then they washed their feet and ate and drank.","While they were enjoying themselves, some worthless men of the city surrounded the house and were pounding on the door, and they kept saying to the old man who owned the house: “Bring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have sex with him.”","At that the owner of the house went out and said to them: “No, my brothers, do not act wickedly. Please, this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this disgraceful act.","Here are my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. Let me bring them out, and you can humiliate them if you must.  But you must not commit this disgraceful act toward this man.”","But the men refused to listen to him, so the man grabbed hold of his concubine and brought her outside to them. They raped her and abused her all night long until the morning. Then they sent her away at the break of dawn.","Early in the morning, the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the man’s house where her master was and lay there until it was light.","When her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house to go out to resume his journey, he saw the woman, his concubine, lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold.","So he said to her: “Get up; let us go.” But there was no answer. The man then put her on the donkey and set out for his home.","When he reached his house, he took the slaughtering knife and took hold of his concubine and cut her up limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent one piece into each territory of Israel.","All who saw it said: “Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt down to this day. Consider it,  take counsel, and tell us what to do.”"],["Consequently, all the Israelites came out from Dan down to Beʹer-sheʹba and from the land of Gilʹe·ad, and the entire assembly gathered unitedly  before Jehovah at Mizʹpah.","So the chiefs of the people and all the tribes of Israel took their places in the congregation of God’s people—400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords.","The Benʹja·min·ites heard that the men of Israel had gone up to Mizʹpah.","At this the Levite man, the husband of the murdered woman, said in  answer: “I came to Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin with my concubine to stay overnight.","And the inhabitants  of Gibʹe·ah rose up against me and surrounded the house by night. They meant to kill me, but they raped my concubine instead, and she died.","So I took my concubine’s body and cut it up and sent the pieces into every part of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a shameful and disgraceful act in Israel.","Now all you people of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.”","Then all the people rose up in unison  and said: “Not one of us will go to his tent or return to his house.","Now this is what we will do to Gibʹe·ah: We will go up against it by lot.","We will take 10 men out of 100 from all the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000 and 1,000 out of 10,000 to collect provisions for the army, so that they may take action against Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin, in view of the disgraceful act that they committed in Israel.”","Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city united  as allies.","Then the tribes of Israel sent men to all the tribesmen of Benjamin, saying: “What is this terrible thing that has happened among you?","Now hand over the worthless men from Gibʹe·ah, so that we may put them to death and clear out what is bad from Israel.” But the Benʹja·min·ites refused to listen to their Israelite brothers.","Then the Benʹja·min·ites gathered together out of the cities to Gibʹe·ah to go out to battle against the men of Israel.","That day the Benʹja·min·ites mustered from their cities 26,000 men armed with swords, apart from the 700 chosen men of Gibʹe·ah.","In this army were 700 chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of these men could sling a stone to within a hairbreadth and would not miss.","The men of Israel apart from Benjamin mustered 400,000 men armed with swords, and each one was an experienced warrior.","They rose up and went up to Bethʹel to inquire of God. Then the people of Israel said: “Who of us should go up in the lead to the battle against the Benʹja·min·ites?” Jehovah replied: “Judah is to take the lead.”","After that the Israelites rose up in the morning and camped against Gibʹe·ah.","The men of Israel now went out to battle against Benjamin; they drew up in battle formation against them at Gibʹe·ah.","So the Benʹja·min·ites came out from Gibʹe·ah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on that day.","However, the army of the men of Israel showed themselves courageous and again drew up in battle formation in the same place as on the first day.","Then the Israelites went up and wept before Jehovah until the evening and inquired of Jehovah: “Should we again go into battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?” To this Jehovah said: “Go up against them.”","So the Israelites drew near to the Benʹja·min·ites on the second day.","In turn Benjamin came out from Gibʹe·ah to meet them on the second day and struck down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords.","At that all the men of Israel went up to Bethʹel. They wept and sat there before Jehovah, and they fasted on that day until the evening and offered up burnt offerings and  communion offerings before Jehovah.","After that the men of Israel inquired of Jehovah, for the ark of the covenant of the true God was there in those days.","Now Phinʹe·has the son of El·e·aʹzar, the son of Aaron, was ministering  before it in those days. They asked: “Should we go out yet again to battle against our brothers, the men of Benjamin, or should we stop?” Jehovah replied: “Go up, because tomorrow I will give them into your hand.”","Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibʹe·ah.","The Israelites went up against the Benʹja·min·ites on the third day, and they drew up in formation against Gibʹe·ah the same as at the other times.","When the Benʹja·min·ites went out to meet the army, they were drawn away from the city. Then, as at the other times, they started to attack and kill some of the men on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethʹel and the other to Gibʹe·ah, leaving about 30 men of Israel dead in the open field.","So the Benʹja·min·ites said: “They are suffering defeat before us the same as before.” But the Israelites said: “We will retreat and draw them away from the city onto the highways.”","So all the men of Israel rose up from their places and drew up in formation at Baʹal-taʹmar while the Israelite ambush charged out of their places in the vicinity of Gibʹe·ah.","Thus 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel came in front of Gibʹe·ah, and the fighting was heavy. But the Benʹja·min·ites did not know that disaster was near at hand.","Jehovah defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 men in Benjamin, all of them armed with swords.","However, the Benʹja·min·ites imagined that the men of Israel would be defeated when they retreated from Benjamin, but they retreated because they trusted in the ambush that was set against Gibʹe·ah.","The ambush acted quickly and charged toward Gibʹe·ah. Then the ambush spread out and struck down the whole city with the sword.","Now the men of Israel had arranged that the men who ambushed the city would make a smoke signal go up from there.","When the Israelites turned around in the battle, the men of Benjamin started by attacking and killing about 30 men of Israel, and they said: “They are clearly suffering another defeat before us, just as in the previous battle.”","But the signal started to go up from the city as a pillar of smoke. When the men of Benjamin turned to look, they saw the whole city going up in flames to the sky.","Then the men of Israel made an about-face, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster had overtaken them.","So they retreated from the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle followed them; the men coming out of the cities joined in striking them down.","They surrounded the Benʹja·min·ites and pursued them relentlessly. They trampled them down directly in front of Gibʹe·ah toward the east.","Finally 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all mighty warriors.","The men of Benjamin turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of Rimʹmon,  and the Israelites killed  5,000 of them on the highways, and they kept pursuing them as far as Giʹdom; so they struck down 2,000 more men.","All those of Benjamin who fell on that day amounted to 25,000 men armed with swords, all mighty warriors.","But 600 retreated into the wilderness to the crag of Rimʹmon, and they stayed on the crag of Rimʹmon for four months.","And the men of Israel turned back against the Benʹja·min·ites and struck those of the city with the sword, from men to livestock, all that remained. Also, they set all the cities in their path on fire."],["Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizʹpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife.”","Consequently, the people came to Bethʹel and sat there before the true God until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly.","And they were saying: “Why, O Jehovah the God of Israel, has this happened in Israel? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel?”","And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings.","Then the people of Israel said: “Who of all the tribes of Israel did not come up to assemble before Jehovah?” for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah would be put to death without fail.","So the people of Israel felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin their brother. They said: “Today one tribe has been chopped off from Israel.","What should we do to provide wives for those who are left, now that we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”","They asked: “Who among the tribes of Israel did not come up to Jehovah at Mizʹpah?” It so happened that no one had come from Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad into the camp where the congregation was.","When the people were counted, they saw that none of the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad were there.","So the assembly sent there 12,000 of the mightiest men. They commanded them: “Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad with the sword, even the women and the children.","This is what you should do: Every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male, you should devote to destruction.”","Among the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, they found 400 girls who were virgins, who had never had sexual relations with a man. So they brought them to the camp at Shiʹloh, which is in the land of Caʹnaan.","Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benʹja·min·ites on the crag of Rimʹmon and offered them peace.","So Benjamin came back at that time. They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, but they did not find enough for them.","And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel.","The elders of the assembly said: “What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men, since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin?”","They replied: “There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel.","But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters, because the people  of Israel have sworn: ‘Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”","Then they said: “Look! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiʹloh, which is north of Bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethʹel to Sheʹchem and south of Le·boʹnah.”","So they commanded the men of Benjamin: “Go and set an ambush in the vineyards.","And when you see the young women  of Shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances, each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiʹloh, and you should return to the land of Benjamin.","And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us, we will then tell them, ‘Show us favor for their sakes, because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty.’”","So the men of Benjamin did just that, and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing. After that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them.","And the Israelites dispersed from there at that time, each one to his tribe and his family, and they departed from there, each one to his inheritance.","In those days there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes."]],"Ruth":[["Now in the days when the judges administered justice,  a famine occurred in the land; and a man went from Bethʹle·hem in Judah to reside as a foreigner in the fields  of Moʹab, he along with his wife and his two sons.","The man’s name was E·limʹe·lech,  his wife’s  name was Na·oʹmi,  and the names of his two sons were Mahʹlon  and Chilʹi·on.  They were Ephʹrath·ites from Bethʹle·hem in Judah. And they came to the fields of Moʹab and remained there.","After some time E·limʹe·lech, Na·oʹmi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.","The men later married Moʹab·ite women; one was named Orʹpah, and the other was named Ruth. They remained there for about ten years.","Then the two sons, Mahʹlon and Chilʹi·on, also died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband.","So she started out with her daughters-in-law to return from the fields of Moʹab, for she had heard in Moʹab that Jehovah had turned his attention to his people by giving them food.","She left the place where she had been living with both of her daughters-in-law. As they were walking on the road to return to the land of Judah,","Na·oʹmi said to both of her daughters-in-law: “Go, return, each of you to your mother’s home. May Jehovah show loyal love to you, just as you have shown it to the men who have died and to me.","May Jehovah grant  that each of you finds security  in the home of your husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept loudly.","They kept saying to her: “No, but we will go with you to your people.”","But Na·oʹmi said: “Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still give birth to sons who could become your husbands?","Return, my daughters. Go, for I have grown too old to marry. Even if I could hope to find a husband tonight and could also bear sons,","would you keep waiting for them until they could grow up? Would you refrain from getting remarried for their sakes? No, my daughters, I feel very bitter for you, because the hand of Jehovah has turned against me.”","Again they wept loudly, after which Orʹpah kissed her mother-in-law and departed. But Ruth stuck with her.","So Na·oʹmi said: “Look! Your widowed sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods. Return with your sister-in-law.”","But Ruth said: “Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you; for where you go I will go, and where you spend the night, I will spend the night. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.","Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you.”","When Na·oʹmi saw that Ruth insisted on going with her, she stopped trying to convince her.","And they both continued on their way until they came to Bethʹle·hem. As soon as they arrived in Bethʹle·hem, the whole city became stirred up over them, and women were saying: “Is this Na·oʹmi?”","She would say to the women: “Do not call me Na·oʹmi.  Call me Maʹra,  for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me.","I was full when I went, but Jehovah made me return empty-handed. Why should you call me Na·oʹmi, when it is Jehovah who opposed me and the Almighty who caused me calamity?”","This is how Na·oʹmi returned from the fields of Moʹab, along with her Moʹab·ite daughter-in-law Ruth. They came to Bethʹle·hem at the beginning of the barley harvest."],["Now Na·oʹmi had a relative on her husband’s side who was very wealthy; his name was Boʹaz, and he was of the family of E·limʹe·lech.","Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess said to Na·oʹmi: “Let me go out, please, to the fields and glean among the ears of grain behind whoever looks on me with favor.” So Na·oʹmi said to her: “Go, my daughter.”","At that she went out and began to glean in the field behind the harvesters. By chance she came upon a plot of land belonging to Boʹaz, who was of the family of E·limʹe·lech.","Just then Boʹaz arrived from Bethʹle·hem and said to the harvesters: “Jehovah be with you.” And they replied: “Jehovah bless you.”","Boʹaz then asked the young man in charge of the harvesters: “To whom does this young woman belong?”","The young man in charge of the harvesters answered: “The young woman is a Moʹab·i·tess who returned with Na·oʹmi from the fields of Moʹab.","She asked, ‘Please, may I glean and gather among the cut-off ears  of grain left behind by the harvesters?’ And she has been on her feet since she came this morning until just now, when she sat in the shelter for a short rest.”","Then Boʹaz said to Ruth: “Listen, my daughter. Do not go away to glean in another field, and do not go anywhere else; stay close by my young women.","Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest, and go with them. I have commanded the young men not to touch  you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn.”","At that she fell facedown and bowed down to the ground and said to him: “How have I found favor in your eyes, and why have you taken notice of me, when I am a foreigner?”","Boʹaz answered her: “A full report was made to me of all you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a people whom you had not known before.","May Jehovah reward you for what you have done, and may there be a perfect wage  for you from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.”","To this she said: “Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, because you have comforted me and spoken reassuringly to  your servant, although I am not even one of your servants.”","Boʹaz said to her at mealtime: “Come here, eat some of the bread, and dip your piece in the vinegar.” So she sat down beside the harvesters. He then handed her some roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied, and she had something left over.","When she got up to glean, Boʹaz commanded his young men: “Let her glean even among the cut-off ears  of grain, and do not mistreat her.","You should also be sure to pull out some ears of grain from the bundles for her and leave them behind for her to glean, and do not say anything to stop her.”","So she continued to glean in the field until evening. When  she beat out what she had gleaned, it came to about an eʹphah  of barley.","Then she took it and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also took out and gave to her the food that was left over after she had eaten her fill.","Her mother-in-law then said to her: “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? May the one who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law about whom she had worked with, saying: “The name of the man I worked with today is Boʹaz.”","At that Na·oʹmi said to her daughter-in-law: “May he be blessed by Jehovah, who has not failed in his loyal love toward the living and the dead.” Na·oʹmi continued: “The man is related to us. He is one of our repurchasers.”","Then Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess said: “He also told me, ‘Stay close by my young people until they have finished my entire harvest.’”","Na·oʹmi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth: “It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his young women than to be harassed in another field.”","So she stayed close to the young women of Boʹaz and gleaned until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest came to an end. And she kept dwelling with her mother-in-law."],["Na·oʹmi, her mother-in-law, now said to her: “My daughter, should I not look for a home  for you, so that it may go well with you?","Is not Boʹaz our relative? He is the one whose young women you were with. Tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor.","So wash yourself and rub on some perfumed oil; then dress up  and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make your presence known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.","When he lies down, take note of the place where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what you should do.”","At that she replied: “All that you say to me I will do.”","So she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.","Meanwhile, Boʹaz ate and drank and was feeling good at heart. Then he went to lie down at the end of the grain heap. After that she quietly came and uncovered his feet and lay down.","At midnight the man began to shiver, and he leaned forward and saw a woman lying at his feet.","He said: “Who are you?” She replied: “I am Ruth, your servant. Spread out your garment  over your servant, for you are a repurchaser.”","At that he said: “May Jehovah bless you, my daughter. You have shown your loyal love more in this last instance than in the first instance, by not going after the young men, whether poor or rich.","And now, my daughter, have no fear. I will do for you everything that you say, for everyone in the city  knows that you are an excellent woman.","While it is true that I am a repurchaser, there is a repurchaser more closely related than I am.","Stay here tonight, and if he will repurchase you in the morning, fine! Let him repurchase you. But if he does not want to repurchase you, I will then repurchase you myself, as  surely as Jehovah lives. Lie down here until the morning.”","So she lay at his feet until the morning and then got up before it was light enough for anyone to be recognized. He then said: “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”","He also said: “Bring the cloak that you are wearing, and hold it out.” So she held it out, and he put six measures  of barley in it and put it on her, after which he went into the city.","She went her way to her mother-in-law, who now said: “How did it go for you,  my daughter?” She told her everything that the man had done for her.","She added: “He gave me these six measures of barley and said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’”","At that she said: “Sit here, my daughter, until you learn how the matter will turn out, for the man will not rest until he settles the matter today.”"],["Now Boʹaz went up to the city gate and sat there. And look! the repurchaser whom Boʹaz had mentioned passed by. At that Boʹaz said: “Come here and sit down, So-and-so.” And he went over and sat down.","Then Boʹaz took ten of the city elders and said: “Sit down here.” So they sat down.","Boʹaz now said to the repurchaser: “Na·oʹmi, who has returned from the fields of Moʹab, must sell the plot of land that belonged to our brother E·limʹe·lech.","So I thought I should disclose it to you and say, ‘Buy it in front of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will repurchase it, repurchase it. But if you will not repurchase it, tell me so that I will know, for you have the claim to repurchase it, and I am next in line after you.’” He replied: “I am willing to repurchase it.”","Then Boʹaz said: “On the day you buy the field from Na·oʹmi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess, the wife of the dead man, in order to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance.”","To this the repurchaser said: “I am unable to repurchase it, for I may ruin my own inheritance. Repurchase it for yourself with my right of repurchase, because I am not able to repurchase it.”","Now this was the custom of former times in Israel concerning the right of repurchase and exchange to validate every sort of transaction: A man had to remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was the manner of confirming an agreement  in Israel.","So when the repurchaser said to Boʹaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he removed his sandal.","Then Boʹaz said to the elders and all the people: “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Na·oʹmi all that belonged to E·limʹe·lech and all that belonged to Chilʹi·on and Mahʹlon.","I am also acquiring Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess, the wife of Mahʹlon, as a wife to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance, so that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home. You are witnesses today.”","At this all the people who were in the city gate and the elders said: “We are witnesses! May Jehovah grant the wife who is entering your house to be like Rachel and like Leʹah, both of whom built the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephʹra·thah and make a good name  in Bethʹle·hem.","May your house become like the house of Peʹrez, whom Taʹmar bore to Judah, through the offspring that Jehovah will give you by this young woman.”","So Boʹaz took Ruth and she became his wife. He had relations with her, and Jehovah let her conceive and she gave birth to a son.","Then the women said to Na·oʹmi: “Praised be Jehovah, who has not left you without a repurchaser today. May his name be proclaimed in Israel!","He  has restored  your life  and will sustain you in your old age, because he has been born to your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons.”","Na·oʹmi took the child and held him to her bosom, and she cared for him.","Then the neighbor women gave him a name. They said, “A son has been born to Na·oʹmi,” and they named him Oʹbed. He is the father of Jesʹse, David’s father.","Now this is the family line  of Peʹrez: Peʹrez became father to Hezʹron;","Hezʹron became father to Ram; Ram became father to Am·minʹa·dab;","Am·minʹa·dab became father to Nahʹshon; Nahʹshon became father to Salʹmon;","Salʹmon became father to Boʹaz; Boʹaz became father to Oʹbed;","Oʹbed became father to Jesʹse; and Jesʹse became father to David."]],"1 Samuel":[["Now there was a man of Ra·math·aʹim-zoʹphim  of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im whose name was El·kaʹnah, the son of Je·roʹham, the son of E·liʹhu, the son of Toʹhu, the son of Zuph, an Eʹphra·im·ite.","He had two wives; one was named Hanʹnah, and the other was named Pe·ninʹnah.

That is where the two sons of Eʹli, Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, served as priests to Jehovah.","One day when El·kaʹnah offered a sacrifice, he gave portions to his wife Pe·ninʹnah as well as to all her sons and  her daughters,","but to Hanʹnah he gave a special portion, because Hanʹnah was the one he loved; but Jehovah had not given her children.","Moreover, her rival wife taunted her relentlessly in order to upset her because Jehovah had not given her children.","That is what she would do year after year; whenever Hanʹnah went up to the house of Jehovah, her rival would taunt her so much that she would weep and not eat.","But her husband El·kaʹnah said to her: “Hanʹnah, why do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why are you so sad?  Am I not better to you than ten sons?”","Then Hanʹnah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiʹloh. At the time, Eʹli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple  of Jehovah.","Hanʹnah was extremely bitter,  and she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably.","And she made this vow: “O Jehovah of armies, if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me and you do not forget your servant and give to your servant a male child, I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will touch his head.”","While she prayed for a long time before Jehovah, Eʹli was watching her mouth.","Hanʹnah was speaking in her heart, only her lips were trembling, but her voice was not heard. So Eʹli thought she was drunk.","Eʹli said to her: “How long will you stay drunk? Stop drinking your wine.”","At this Hanʹnah answered: “No, my lord! I am a woman under great stress;  I have not drunk wine or anything alcoholic, but I am pouring out my soul  before Jehovah.","Do not take your servant for a worthless woman, for I have been speaking until now out of my great anguish and distress.”","Then Eʹli answered: “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.”","To this she said: “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” And the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast.","Then they got up early in the morning and bowed before Jehovah, after which they returned to their house in Raʹmah. El·kaʹnah had sexual relations with his wife Hanʹnah, and Jehovah gave attention to  her.","Within a year  Hanʹnah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him Samuel,  because, as she said, “it is from Jehovah that I have asked him.”","In time El·kaʹnah went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Jehovah and to present his vow offering.","But Hanʹnah did not go up, for she said to her husband: “As soon as the boy is weaned, I will bring him; then he will appear before Jehovah and remain there from then on.”","El·kaʹnah her husband then said to her: “Do what you think is best.  Stay at home until you wean him. May Jehovah carry out what you have said.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him.","As soon as she had weaned him, she took him  up to Shiʹloh, along with a three-year-old bull, one eʹphah  of flour, and a large jar of wine, and she came to the house of Jehovah in Shiʹloh and brought the young boy with her.","Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eʹli.","With that she said: “Pardon me, my lord! As surely as you live,  my lord, I am the woman who was standing with you in this place to pray to Jehovah.","It was for this boy that I prayed, and Jehovah granted my petition that I asked of him.","I, in turn, now lend him to Jehovah. For all his days, he is lent to Jehovah.”"],["Then Hanʹnah said in prayer:","2  There is no one holy like Jehovah,","3  Do not keep speaking with haughtiness;","4  The bows of mighty men are shattered,","5  The well-fed must hire themselves out for bread,","6  Jehovah kills, and he preserves life;","7  Jehovah impoverishes, and he enriches;","8  He raises the lowly one from the dust;","9  He guards the steps of his loyal ones,","Jehovah will shatter those fighting against him;","Then El·kaʹnah went to his house in Raʹmah, but the boy  became a minister of  Jehovah before Eʹli the priest.","Now the sons of Eʹli were wicked men; they had no regard for Jehovah.","This is what they did with the due right of the priests from the people: Whenever any man was offering a sacrifice, an attendant of the priest came with a three-pronged fork in his hand when the meat was boiling,","and he would thrust it into the basin, the two-handled cooking pot, the cauldron, or the one-handled cooking pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. That is what they would do in Shiʹloh to all the Israelites coming there.","Also, even before the man sacrificing could make the fat smoke, an attendant of the priest would come and say to him: “Give the priest meat to roast. He will not take boiled meat from you, only raw meat.”","When the man would say to him: “Let them first be sure to make the fat smoke, then take for yourself whatever you desire,”  he would say: “No, give it to me now; if not, I will take it by force!”","Thus the sin of the attendants came to be very great before Jehovah, for the men treated the offering of Jehovah with disrespect.","Now Samuel was ministering before Jehovah, wearing  a linen ephʹod, though he was just a boy.","Also, his mother would make for him a little sleeveless coat, and she brought it up to him year after year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","And Eʹli blessed El·kaʹnah and his wife and said: “May Jehovah grant you a child from this wife in place of the one who was lent to Jehovah.” And they went back home.","Jehovah turned his attention to Hanʹnah, so that she could conceive; and she gave birth to three more sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel continued growing up before Jehovah.","Now Eʹli was very old, but he had heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel and how they would lie down with the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.","He used to say to them: “Why do you keep doing things like these? For the things I am hearing about you from all the people are bad.","No, my sons, the report that I hear circulating among the people of Jehovah is not good.","If a man should sin against another man, someone may appeal to Jehovah for him;  but if a man should sin against Jehovah, who can pray for him?” But they refused to listen to their father, for Jehovah had determined to put them to death.","Meanwhile, the boy Samuel kept growing in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with the people.","A man of God came to Eʹli and said to him: “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Did I not plainly reveal myself to your father’s house while they were in Egypt as slaves to the house of Pharʹaoh?","And he was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to serve as my priest and to go up on my altar to make sacrifices, to offer incense,  and to bear an ephʹod before me; and I gave to the house of your forefather all the offerings made by fire of the Israelites.","Why do you men scorn  my sacrifice  and my offering that I have commanded in my place of dwelling? Why do you keep honoring your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the best portions of every offering of my people Israel?","“‘That is why the word of Jehovah the God of Israel is: “I did indeed say that your house and the house of your forefather would always walk before me.” But now Jehovah declares: “It is unthinkable, on my part, because those honoring me I will honor, but those despising me will be treated with contempt.”","Look! Days are coming when I will cut off your strength  and that of your father’s house, so that no man in your house will live to old age.","And you will look upon a rival in my dwelling amid all the good that is done to Israel, and never again will there be an old man in your house.","The man of yours whom I do not cut off from serving at my altar will cause your eyes to fail and will bring you grief,  but the greater number of your house will die by the sword of men.","And what happens to your two sons, Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, will be the sign for you: On one day both of them will die.","Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will act in harmony with what is my heart’s desire;  and I will build for him a lasting house, and he will walk before my anointed one always.","Anyone who remains in your house will come and bow down to him for the payment of money and a loaf of bread, and will say: “Assign me, please, to one of the priestly offices to eat a piece of bread.”’”"],["Meanwhile, the boy Samuel was ministering to Jehovah before Eʹli, but word from Jehovah had become rare in those days; visions were not widespread.","One day Eʹli was lying down in his usual place, and his eyes had grown dim; he was not able to see.","The lamp of God had not yet been extinguished, and Samuel was lying in the temple  of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was.","Jehovah then called Samuel. He answered: “Here I am.”","He ran to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call. Lie down again.” So he went and lay down.","Jehovah called once again: “Samuel!” At this Samuel got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said: “I did not call, my son. Lie down again.”","(Now Samuel had not yet come to know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.)","So Jehovah called again, a third time: “Samuel!” At that he got up and went to Eʹli and said: “Here I am, for you called me.”","So Eʹli said to Samuel: “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you should say, ‘Speak, Jehovah, for your servant is listening.’” And Samuel went and lay down in his place.","Jehovah came and stood there, and he called as at the other times: “Samuel, Samuel!” At this Samuel said: “Speak, for your servant is listening.”","Jehovah said to Samuel: “Look! I am doing something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle.","On that day I will carry out toward Eʹli all that I said  about his house, from start to finish.","You must tell him that I am bringing a lasting judgment on his house for the error that he has known about, for his sons are cursing God, but he has not rebuked them.","That is why I have sworn to the house of Eʹli that the error of the house of Eʹli will never be atoned for by sacrifices or by offerings.”","Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of Jehovah’s house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eʹli of the vision.","But Eʹli called for Samuel: “Samuel, my son!” At this he said: “Here I am.”","He asked: “What message did he speak to you? Please, do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and add to it if you hide from me a single word of all that he said to you.”","So Samuel told him everything, and he did not hide anything from him. Eʹli said: “It is Jehovah. Let him do what is good in his eyes.”","Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah himself was with him and did not let any of all his words go unfulfilled.","All Israel from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba became aware that Samuel had been confirmed as Jehovah’s prophet.","And Jehovah continued to appear in Shiʹloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiʹloh by the word of Jehovah."],["And the word of Samuel went out to all Israel.","The Phi·lisʹtines drew up in battle formation to meet Israel, but the battle went badly and Israel was defeated by the Phi·lisʹtines, who struck down about 4,000 men from the battle line in the field.","When the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said: “Why did Jehovah allow us to be defeated  today by the Phi·lisʹtines? Let us take the ark of Jehovah’s covenant with us from Shiʹloh, so that it may be with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.”","So the people sent men to Shiʹloh, and they carried from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies, who sits enthroned above  the cherubs. The two sons of Eʹli, Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, were also there with the ark of the covenant of the true God.","As soon as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all the Israelites broke out into loud shouting, so that the earth shook.","When the Phi·lisʹtines heard the sound of the shouting, they said: “Why is there such loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” Finally they learned that the Ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.","The Phi·lisʹtines became afraid, for they said: “God has come into the camp!” So they said: “Too bad for us, for nothing like this has ever happened before!","Too bad for us! Who will save us from the hand of this majestic God? This is the God who struck Egypt with every sort of slaughter in the wilderness.","Be courageous and act like men, you Phi·lisʹtines, so that you may not serve the Hebrews just as they have served you. Act like men and fight!”","So the Phi·lisʹtines fought and Israel was defeated, and each one fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; on Israel’s side, 30,000 foot soldiers fell.","Moreover,  the Ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eʹli, Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, died.","A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and arrived at Shiʹloh on that day with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head.","When the man arrived, Eʹli was sitting on the seat by the roadside watching, because his heart was trembling over the Ark of the true God. The man went into the city to report the news, and the whole city began crying out.","When Eʹli heard the sound of the outcry, he asked: “What does the sound of this turmoil mean?” The same man hurried in and reported the news to Eʹli.","(Now Eʹli was 98 years old, and his eyes stared straight ahead, and he could not see.)","Then the man said to Eʹli: “I am the one who came from the battle line! Just today I fled from the battle line.” At this he asked: “What happened, my son?”","So the bearer of the news related: “Israel has fled from the Phi·lisʹtines, and there was a great defeat among the people; also your own two sons, Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, have died, and the Ark of the true God has been captured.”","At the moment he mentioned the Ark of the true God, Eʹli fell backward from his seat beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for 40 years.","His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinʹe·has, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard the report that the Ark of the true God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she doubled over and unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth.","As she was dying, the women standing by her said: “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” She did not answer and did not pay attention to it.","But she named the boy Ichʹa·bod,  saying: “Glory has gone away from Israel into exile,” referring to the capture of the Ark of the true God and what happened to her father-in-law and her husband.","She said: “Glory has gone away from Israel into exile, because the Ark of the true God has been captured.”"],["When the Phi·lisʹtines captured the Ark of the true God, they brought it from Eb·en·eʹzer to Ashʹdod.","The Phi·lisʹtines took the Ark of the true God and brought it into the house  of Daʹgon and set it beside Daʹgon.","When the Ashʹdod·ites got up early the next day, there was Daʹgon fallen facedown on the ground before the Ark of Jehovah. So they took Daʹgon and returned him to his place.","When they got up early in the morning on the following day, there was Daʹgon fallen facedown on the ground before the Ark of Jehovah. The head of Daʹgon and the palms of both his hands were cut off and were lying on the threshold. Only the fish part  had been left intact.","That is why to this day, the priests of Daʹgon and all those who enter the house of Daʹgon do not walk on the threshold of Daʹgon in Ashʹdod.","The hand of Jehovah was heavy against the Ashʹdod·ites, and he devastated them by striking Ashʹdod and its territories with piles.","When the men of Ashʹdod saw what was happening, they said: “Do not let the  Ark of the God of Israel remain with us, for his hand has dealt harshly with us and our god Daʹgon.”","So they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines and asked them: “What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?” They replied: “Let the Ark of the God of Israel be moved to Gath.” So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel there.","After they moved it there, the hand of Jehovah came against the city, bringing great panic. He struck the men of the city, from small to great, and piles broke out on them.","So they sent the Ark of the true God to Ekʹron, but as soon as the Ark of the true God came to Ekʹron, the Ekʹron·ites began to cry out: “They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us to put us and our people to death!”","Then they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines and said: “Send the Ark of the God of Israel away; let it return to its place so that we and our people may not be put to death.” For the terror of death had spread through the whole city; the hand of the true God had been very heavy there,","and the men who did not die had been struck with piles. And the city’s cry for help ascended to the heavens."],["The Ark of Jehovah was in Phi·lisʹtine territory for seven months.","The Phi·lisʹtines called the priests and the diviners and asked: “What should we do with the Ark of Jehovah? Let us know how we should send it back to its place.”","They replied: “If you send the ark of the covenant of Jehovah the God of Israel away, do not send it back without an offering. You should by all means return to him a guilt offering. Only then will you be healed, and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned away from you.”","So they asked: “What guilt offering should we send to him?” They said: “According to the number of the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines, send five golden piles  and five golden mice, for the same scourge has afflicted every one of you and your lords.","You should make images of your piles and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin, and you should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten the weight of his hand that is on you and your god and your land.","Why should you harden your heart as Egypt and Pharʹaoh hardened their hearts? When He dealt harshly with them, they had to send Israel away, and they departed.","Now prepare a new wagon and two cows that have calves and have never been under a yoke. Then hitch the cows to the wagon, but take their calves back home, away from them.","Take the Ark of Jehovah and place it on the wagon, and put the golden articles that you are sending to him as a guilt offering in a box next to it. Then send it on its way","and watch: If it goes up the road to Beth-sheʹmesh, to its own territory, then he is the one who has done this great evil to us. But if not, we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.”","The men did accordingly. They took two cows that had calves and hitched them to the wagon, and the calves they penned up at home.","Then they put the Ark of Jehovah on the wagon, as well as the box containing the golden mice and the images of their piles.","And the cows went straight ahead on the road to  Beth-sheʹmesh. They stayed on the one highway, mooing as they went; they did not turn either to the right or to the left. All the while the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines were walking behind them as far as the boundary of Beth-sheʹmesh.","The people of Beth-sheʹmesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley plain.  When they raised their eyes and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed at seeing it.","The wagon came into the field of Joshua the Beth-sheʹmite and stopped there near a large stone. So they chopped up the wood of the wagon, and they offered the cows as a burnt offering to Jehovah.","The Levites took down the Ark of Jehovah and the box that was with it, which contained the golden articles, and they put them on the large stone. The men of Beth-sheʹmesh offered up burnt offerings and made sacrifices on that day to Jehovah.","When the five lords of the Phi·lisʹtines saw it, they returned to Ekʹron on that day.","Now these are the golden piles that the Phi·lisʹtines sent as a guilt offering to Jehovah: one for Ashʹdod, one for Gazʹa, one for Ashʹke·lon, one for Gath, one for Ekʹron.","And the number of the golden mice corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Phi·lisʹtines that belonged to the five lords—both the fortified cities and the villages in the open country.","But God struck down the men of Beth-sheʹmesh, because they had looked upon the Ark of Jehovah. He struck down 50,070  among the people, and the people began mourning because Jehovah had struck them down with a great slaughter.","So the men of Beth-sheʹmesh asked: “Who will be able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God, and to whom will he go away from us?”","So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, saying: “The Phi·lisʹtines have returned the Ark of Jehovah. Come down and take it up with you.”"],["So the men of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim came and took the Ark of Jehovah up into the house of A·binʹa·dab on the hill, and they sanctified his son El·e·aʹzar to guard the Ark of Jehovah.","A long time elapsed, 20 years in all, from the day of the Ark’s coming to Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, and all the house of Israel began to seek  after Jehovah.","Samuel then said to all the house of Israel: “If you are returning to Jehovah with all your heart, put away the foreign gods and the Ashʹto·reth images from among you, and direct your heart unswervingly to Jehovah and serve only him, and he will rescue you from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","At that the Israelites got rid of the Baʹals and the Ashʹto·reth images and served only Jehovah.","Then Samuel said: “Gather all Israel together at Mizʹpah, and I will pray to Jehovah in your behalf.”","So they gathered together at Mizʹpah, and they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah and kept a fast on that day. There they said: “We have sinned against Jehovah.” And Samuel began serving as judge over the Israelites in Mizʹpah.","When the Phi·lisʹtines heard that the Israelites had gathered together at Mizʹpah, the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Phi·lisʹtines.","So the Israelites said to Samuel: “Do not stop calling to Jehovah our God to help us and to save us from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah; and Samuel called to Jehovah for help in behalf of Israel, and Jehovah answered him.","As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Phi·lisʹtines advanced for battle against Israel. Jehovah now caused it to thunder loudly on that day against the Phi·lisʹtines, and He threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.","At that the men of Israel went out from Mizʹpah and pursued the Phi·lisʹtines, striking them down as far as south of Beth-car.","Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizʹpah and Jeshʹa·nah and named it Eb·en·eʹzer,  for he said: “Until now Jehovah has helped us.”","Thus the Phi·lisʹtines were subdued, and they did not come again into the territory of Israel; and the hand of Jehovah continued against the Phi·lisʹtines all the days of Samuel.","Also, the cities that the Phi·lisʹtines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekʹron to Gath, and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.","Samuel kept on judging Israel throughout his life.","Each year he traveled in a circuit to Bethʹel, Gilʹgal, and Mizʹpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.","But he would return to Raʹmah, because his house was there, and there he also judged Israel. He built an altar there to Jehovah."],["When Samuel had grown old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel.","The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, A·biʹjah; they were judges in Beʹer-sheʹba.","But his sons did not walk in his ways; they were inclined to pursue dishonest profit, they accepted bribes, and they perverted justice.","In time all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Raʹmah.","They said to him: “Look! You have grown old, but your sons are not walking in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the other nations.”","But it displeased  Samuel when they said: “Give us a king to judge us.” Then Samuel prayed to Jehovah,","and Jehovah said to Samuel: “Listen to everything the people say to you; for it is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected as their king.","They are doing just as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day; they keep forsaking me and serving other gods, and that is what they are doing to you.","Now listen to them. However, you should solemnly warn them; tell them what the king who rules over them will have the right to demand.”","So Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king all the words of Jehovah.","He said: “This is what the king who rules over you will have the right to demand: He will take your sons and put  them in his chariots and make them his horsemen, and some will have to run before his chariots.","And he will appoint for himself chiefs over thousands and chiefs over fifties, and some will do his plowing, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.","He will take your daughters to be ointment mixers,  cooks, and bakers.","He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and he will give them to his servants.","He will take the tenth of your grainfields and your vineyards, and he will give it to his court officials and his servants.","And he will take your male and female servants, your best herds, and your donkeys, and he will use them for his work.","He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you will become his servants.","The day will come when you will cry out because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but Jehovah will not answer you in that day.”","However, the people refused to listen to what Samuel told them, and they said: “No, we are determined to have a king over us.","Then we will be like all the other nations, and our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles.”","After Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the hearing of Jehovah.","Jehovah said to Samuel: “Listen to them, and appoint a king to reign over them.” Samuel then said to the men of Israel: “Each of you should return to his city.”"],["There was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of A·biʹel, the son of Zeʹror son of Be·coʹrath son of A·phiʹah, a Benʹja·min·ite and a very wealthy man.","He had a son named Saul, who was young and handsome—there was no man among the Israelites more handsome than he—and he stood head and shoulders taller than all the people.","When the donkeys  belonging to Saul’s father Kish got lost, Kish said to his son Saul: “Please take with you one of the attendants and go look for the donkeys.”","They passed through the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im and through the land of Shalʹi·shah, and they did not find them. They traveled through the land of Shaʹa·lim, but the donkeys were not there. They passed through the entire land of the Benʹja·min·ites, and they did not find them.","They came into the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his attendant who was with him: “Come, let us return, so that my father does not start worrying about us rather than the donkeys.”","But the attendant replied: “Look, there is a man of God in this city, a man who is held in honor. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.”","At this Saul said to his attendant: “If we go, what can we take to the man? There is no bread in our bags; there is nothing to take as a gift to the man of the true God. What do we have?”","So the attendant answered Saul again: “Look! There is a quarter of a shekel  of silver in my hand. I will give it to the man of the true God, and he will tell us which way to go.”","(In former times in Israel, this was what a man would say when going to  seek God: “Come, and let us go to the seer.” For the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times.)","Then Saul said to his attendant: “What you said is good. Let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of the true God was.","While they were going up the ascent to the city, they met girls going out to draw water. So they said to them: “Is the seer in this place?”","They answered: “He is. Look, he is just ahead of you. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, because the people are making a sacrifice today on the high place.","As soon as you come into the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, for he is the one who blesses the sacrifice. Once that is done, those who are invited may eat. So now go up right away, and you will find him.”","So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the middle of the city, there was Samuel coming out to meet them to go up to the high place.","The day before Saul came, Jehovah had told  Samuel:","“Tomorrow about this time, I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must anoint him as leader over my people Israel, and he will save my people from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines. For I have seen the affliction of my people, and their outcry has reached me.”","When Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah told him: “Here is the man of whom I said to you, ‘This is the one who will govern my people.’”","Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said: “Tell me, please, where is the house of the seer?”","Samuel answered Saul: “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, and you will eat with me today. I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that you want to know.","As for the donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And to whom does all that is desirable of Israel belong? Is it not to you and to the whole house of your father?”","At this Saul answered: “Am I not a Benʹja·min·ite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? So why have you spoken to me in this way?”","Then Samuel took Saul and his attendant and brought them to the dining hall and gave them a place at the head of those invited; there were about 30 men.","Samuel said to the cook: “Bring the portion that I gave you and told you, ‘Set it aside.’”","At that the cook lifted up the leg and what was on it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: “What has been reserved has been set before you. Eat, because they have reserved it for you for this occasion. For I told them, ‘I invited guests.’” So Saul ate with Samuel on that day.","Then they went down from the high place to the city, and he continued to speak with Saul on the housetop.","They rose early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: “Get ready, so that I may send you away.” So Saul got ready and both he and Samuel went outside.","While they were descending toward the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul: “Tell the attendant to go  on ahead of us,” so he went on ahead. “But you, stand still now, so that I may let you hear the word of God.”"],["Samuel then took the flask of oil and poured it out on Saul’s head. He kissed him and said: “Has not Jehovah anointed you as a leader over his inheritance?","When you leave me today, you will find two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelʹzah, and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys that you went to look for have been found, but now your father has forgotten about the donkeys and is worried about you. He is saying: “What should I do about my son?”’","Go on from there until you come to the big tree of Taʹbor, where you will meet three men going up to the true God at Bethʹel, one carrying three young goats, one carrying three loaves of bread, and one carrying a large jar of wine.","They will ask about your welfare and give you two loaves, and you must accept the loaves from them.","After that you will come to the hill of the true God, where there is a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines. When you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, and a stringed instrument and tambourine and flute and harp will be played ahead of them while they are prophesying.","The spirit of Jehovah will empower you, and you will prophesy along with them and be changed into a different person.","When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds possible, because the true God is with you.","Then go down ahead of me to Gilʹgal, and I will go down to you there to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices. You should wait for seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do.”","As soon as Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God began changing his heart to be like that of someone else, and all these signs came true on that day.","So they went from there to the hill, and a group of prophets met him. At once the spirit of God empowered him, and he began to prophesy among them.","When all those who previously knew him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they said to one another: “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”","Then a man from there said: “But who is their father?” So it became a saying:  “Is Saul also among the prophets?”","When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place.","The brother of Saul’s father later said to him and to his attendant: “Where did you go?” At that he said: “To look for the donkeys, but we saw that they were not there, so we went to Samuel.”","Saul’s uncle asked: “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?”","Saul replied to his uncle: “He told us that the donkeys had already been found.” But Saul did not tell him what Samuel said about the matter of the kingship.","Samuel then called the people together to Jehovah at Mizʹpah","and said to the Israelites: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘It was I who brought Israel up out of Egypt and who rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.","But today you have rejected your God who was your Savior out  of all your evils and distresses, and you said: “No, you should appoint a king over us.” Now take your stand before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.’”","So Samuel had all the tribes of Israel draw near, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected.","Then he had the tribe of Benjamin draw near by its families, and the family of the Matʹrites was selected. Finally Saul the son of Kish was selected. But when they went to look for him, he was nowhere to be found.","So they inquired of Jehovah: “Has the man come here yet?” Jehovah answered: “There he is hiding himself among the luggage.”","So they ran and brought him from there. When he stood in the middle of the people, he was head and shoulders taller than all the other people.","Samuel said to all the people: “Do you see the one whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?” And all the people began to shout: “Long live the king!”","Samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of kings and wrote it in a book and deposited it before Jehovah. Then Samuel sent all the people away, everyone to his house.","Saul also went to his home in Gibʹe·ah, accompanied by the warriors whose hearts Jehovah had touched.","But some worthless men said: “How will this one save us?” So they despised him, and they did not bring any gift to him. But he said nothing about it."],["Then Naʹhash the Amʹmon·ite came up and camped against Jaʹbesh in Gilʹe·ad. All the men of Jaʹbesh said to Naʹhash: “Make a covenant  with us, and we will serve you.”","Naʹhash the Amʹmon·ite said to them: “I will make it with you on this condition: that all your right eyes be bored out. I will do this to humiliate all Israel.”","The elders of Jaʹbesh replied to him: “Give us seven days’ time so that we can send messengers into all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to rescue us, we will surrender to you.”","In time the messengers came to Gibʹe·ah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept at the top of their voice.","But Saul was coming from the field behind the herd, and Saul said: “What is the matter with the people? Why are they weeping?” So they related to him the words of the men of Jaʹbesh.","The spirit of God empowered Saul when he heard these words, and he burned with anger.","So he took a pair of bulls and cut them into pieces, and he sent these into all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, who said: “Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel should expect this to be done to his cattle!” And the fear of Jehovah fell upon the people, so that they came out with one accord.","Then he counted them in Beʹzek, and there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah.","They now said to the messengers who had come: “This is what you should say to the men of Jaʹbesh in Gilʹe·ad, ‘Tomorrow when the sun gets hot, you will be saved.’” With that the messengers came and told the men of Jaʹbesh, and they were overjoyed.","So the men of Jaʹbesh said: “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you may  do to us whatever seems good to you.”","On the next day, Saul divided the people into three bands, and they made their way into the middle of the camp during the morning watch  and struck down the Amʹmon·ites until the day grew hot. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.","Then the people said to Samuel: “Who was saying, ‘Is Saul to be king over us?’ Hand the men over, and we will put them to death.”","However, Saul said: “Not a man should be put to death on this day, for today Jehovah has rescued Israel.”","Samuel later said to the people: “Come and let us go to Gilʹgal to reconfirm the kingship.”","So all the people went to Gilʹgal, and in Gilʹgal they made Saul king before Jehovah. Then they offered communion sacrifices there before Jehovah, and Saul and all the men of Israel celebrated with great joy."],["Finally Samuel said to all Israel: “Here I have done  all that you asked of me, and I appointed a king to reign over you.","Now here is the king who is leading  you! As for me, I have grown old and gray, and my sons are here with you, and I have led you from my youth until this day.","Here I am. Testify against me before Jehovah and before his anointed one: Whose bull or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded or crushed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe  to make me look the other way? If I have, I will restore it to you.”","To this they said: “You have not defrauded us or crushed us or accepted anything at all from anyone’s hand.”","So he said to them: “Jehovah is a witness against you, and his anointed one is a witness this day that you have found nothing to accuse me of.”  To this they said: “He is a witness.”","So Samuel said to the people: “Jehovah, who used Moses and Aaron and who brought your forefathers up out of the land of Egypt, is a witness.","And now take your positions, and I will judge you before Jehovah in view of all the righteous acts that Jehovah has done for you and for your forefathers.","“As soon as Jacob had come into Egypt and your forefathers began calling to Jehovah for help, Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to lead your forefathers out of Egypt and to cause them to dwell in this place.","But they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisʹe·ra the chief of the army of Haʹzor and into the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines and into the hand of the king of Moʹab, and they fought against them.","And they called to Jehovah for help and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have left Jehovah to serve the Baʹals and the Ashʹto·reth images; now rescue us out of the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you.’","Then Jehovah sent Jer·ub·baʹal and Beʹdan and Jephʹthah and Samuel and rescued you from the hand of the enemies all around you, so that you could live in security.","When you saw that Naʹhash, the king of the Amʹmon·ites, had come against you, you kept saying to me, ‘No, we are  determined to have a king over us!’ even though Jehovah your God is your King.","Now here is the king whom you have chosen, the one you asked for. Look! Jehovah has appointed a king over you.","If you fear Jehovah and serve him and obey his voice and you do not rebel against the order of Jehovah, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow Jehovah your God, fine.","But if you do not obey the voice of Jehovah and you rebel against the order of Jehovah, the hand of Jehovah will be against you and your fathers.","Now take your positions and see this great thing that Jehovah is doing before your eyes.","Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on Jehovah to make it thunder and rain; then know and understand what an evil thing you have done in the eyes of Jehovah in asking for a king for yourselves.”","At that Samuel called to Jehovah, and Jehovah made it thunder and rain on that day, so that all the people were greatly in fear of Jehovah and of Samuel.","And all the people said to Samuel: “Pray to Jehovah your God for your servants, as we do not want to die, for we have added to all our sins another evil by asking for a king.”","So Samuel said to the people: “Do not be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil. Only do not turn away from following Jehovah, and serve Jehovah with all your heart.","Do not turn away to follow the empty things,  which are of no benefit and cannot rescue, because they are empty.","For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people, for Jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people.","As for me, it is unthinkable for me to sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray in your behalf, and I will continue to instruct you in the good and right way.","Only fear Jehovah, and serve him faithfully  with all your heart, for see what great things he has done for you.","But if you flagrantly do what is bad, you will be swept away, both you and your king.”"],["Saul was . . .  years old when he became king, and for two years he reigned over Israel.","Saul chose 3,000 men out of Israel; 2,000 of these were with Saul at Michʹmash and in the mountainous region of Bethʹel and 1,000 were with Jonʹa·than at Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people away, each one to his tent.","Then Jonʹa·than struck down the garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines that was in Geʹba, and the Phi·lisʹtines heard about it. And Saul had the horn blown throughout all the land, saying: “Let the Hebrews hear!”","All Israel heard the news: “Saul has struck down a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines, and now Israel has become a stench among the Phi·lisʹtines.” So the people were summoned to follow Saul at Gilʹgal.","The Phi·lisʹtines also gathered together to fight against Israel, with 30,000 war chariots and 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; and they went up and camped in Michʹmash to the east of Beth-aʹven.","And the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because they were hard-pressed; so the people hid in the caves, the hollows,  the crags, the cellars,  and the cisterns.","Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilʹe·ad. But Saul was still in Gilʹgal, and all the people following him were trembling.","He continued waiting for seven days until the designated  time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilʹgal, and the people were scattering from him.","Finally Saul said: “Bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices.” And he offered up the burnt sacrifice.","But as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to meet him and bless him.","Then Samuel said: “What have you done?” Saul replied: “I saw that the people were deserting me, and you did not come within the designated time, and the Phi·lisʹtines were gathering together at Michʹmash.","So I said to myself, ‘Now the Phi·lisʹtines will come down against me at Gilʹgal, and I have not sought the favor  of Jehovah.’ So I felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice.”","At this Samuel said to Saul: “You have acted foolishly. You have not obeyed the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you. If you had, Jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over Israel forever.","But now your kingdom will not last. Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart, and Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people, because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you.”","Then Samuel rose and went his way up from Gilʹgal to Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin, and Saul took the count of the people; those still with him were about 600 men.","Saul, his son Jonʹa·than, and the people still with them were dwelling in Geʹba of Benjamin, and the Phi·lisʹtines had encamped at Michʹmash.","And the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines in three bands. One band would turn toward the road to Ophʹrah, to the land of Shuʹal;","another band would turn toward the road of Beth-hoʹron; and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of Ze·boʹim, toward the wilderness.","Now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Phi·lisʹtines had said: “So that the Hebrews may not make a sword or a spear.”","And all the Israelites had to go down to the Phi·lisʹtines to get their plowshares, mattocks, axes, or sickles sharpened.","The price for sharpening was a pim  for the plowshares, for the mattocks, for the three-toothed instruments, for the axes, and for fixing fast the oxgoad.","And on the day of battle, not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonʹa·than; only Saul and his son Jonʹa·than had weapons.","Now a garrison  of the Phi·lisʹtines had gone out to the ravine pass of Michʹmash."],["One day Jonʹa·than the son of Saul said to the attendant carrying his weapons: “Come and let us cross over to the Phi·lisʹtine outpost on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.","Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibʹe·ah under the pomegranate tree in  Migʹron, and there were about 600 men with him.","(And A·hiʹjah the son of A·hiʹtub, the brother of Ichʹa·bod, the son of Phinʹe·has, the son of Eʹli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiʹloh, was carrying the ephʹod.) And the people did not know that Jonʹa·than had gone.","Now between the passages that Jonʹa·than was trying to cross over to reach the outpost of the Phi·lisʹtines, there was a toothlike crag on one side and a toothlike crag on the other side; the name of the one was Boʹzez, and the name of the other was Seʹneh.","The one crag was a pillar on the north facing Michʹmash, and the other was on the south facing Geʹba.","So Jonʹa·than said to his armor-bearer: “Come and let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf, for nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few.”","At this his armor-bearer said to him: “Do whatever your heart impels you to do. Turn wherever you wish, and I will follow you wherever your heart impels you.”","Then Jonʹa·than said: “We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them.","If they say to us, ‘Stand still until we come to you!’ we will stand where we are and not go up to them.","But if they say, ‘Come up against us!’ we will go up, because Jehovah will give them into our hand. This will be our sign.”","Then both of them revealed their presence to the outpost of the Phi·lisʹtines. The Phi·lisʹtines said: “Look! The Hebrews are coming out from the holes where they have been hiding.”","So the men of the outpost said to Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer: “Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson!” At once Jonʹa·than said to his armor-bearer: “Follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.”","And Jonʹa·than climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer was behind him; and the Phi·lisʹtines began to fall before Jonʹa·than, and his armor-bearer was putting them to death behind him.","In the first attack that Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer made, they struck down about 20 men within about half the plowing line in an acre of field.","Then terror spread in the field camp and among all the people of the outpost, and even the raiding parties were terrified. The earth began quaking, and a terror from God ensued.","Saul’s watchmen in Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin saw that the turmoil was spreading in every direction.","Saul said to the people with him: “Take a count, please, and see who has left us.” When they took the count, they saw that Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer were not there.","Saul now said to A·hiʹjah: “Bring the Ark of the true God near!” (For the Ark of the true God was with the Israelites at that time. )","And while Saul was speaking to the priest, the turmoil in the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines was growing greater and greater. Then Saul said to the priest: “Stop what you are doing.”","So Saul and all the people with him assembled and went into the battle, where they found that the Phi·lisʹtines had turned their swords against one another, and the confusion was  very great.","Also, the Hebrews who had previously sided with the Phi·lisʹtines and who had come up with them into the camp were going over to Israel under Saul and Jonʹa·than.","All the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im heard that the Phi·lisʹtines had fled, and they too joined in pursuing them in the battle.","So Jehovah saved Israel on that day, and the battle extended as far as Beth-aʹven.","But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under this oath: “Cursed is the man who eats any food  before the evening and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies!” So none of the people ate any food.","And all the people  came into the forest, and there was honey on the ground.","When the people came into the forest, they saw the honey dripping, but no one would put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.","But Jonʹa·than had not heard his father put the people under an oath, so he stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. When he drew his hand back to his mouth, his eyes brightened.","At this one of the people said: “Your father put the people under a strict oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today!’ That is why the people are so tired.”","However, Jonʹa·than said: “My father has brought great trouble  on the land. Look at how my eyes brightened because I tasted this little bit of honey.","How much better if the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies that they found! For then the slaughter of the Phi·lisʹtines would have been even greater.”","On that day they kept striking down the Phi·lisʹtines from Michʹmash to Aiʹja·lon, and the people became very tired.","So the people began rushing greedily at the spoil, and they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and they ate the meat along with the blood.","So it was reported to Saul: “Look! The people are sinning against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood.” At this he said: “You have acted faithlessly. Roll a large stone to me immediately.”","Saul then said: “Spread out among the people and say to them, ‘Each of you must bring his bull and his sheep and slaughter them here and then eat them. Do not sin against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood.’” So each of them brought his bull with him that night and slaughtered it there.","And Saul built an altar to Jehovah. This was the first altar he built to Jehovah.","Saul later said: “Let us go down after the Phi·lisʹtines by night and plunder them until the morning light. We will not leave a single survivor.” To this they said: “Do whatever seems good in your eyes.” Then the priest said: “Let us approach the true God here.”","And Saul inquired of God: “Should I go down after the Phi·lisʹtines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But God did not answer him on that day.","So Saul said: “Come here, all you chiefs of the people, and find out what sin has been committed today.","For as surely as Jehovah is alive, who rescued Israel, even if it turns out to be Jonʹa·than my  son, he must die.” But none of the people would answer him.","Then he said to all Israel: “You will be on one side, and my son Jonʹa·than and I will be on the other side.” At this the people said to Saul: “Do whatever seems good in your eyes.”","Saul then said to Jehovah: “O God of Israel, answer with the Thumʹmim!” Then Jonʹa·than and Saul were selected, and the people went free.","Saul now said: “Cast lots to decide between me and my son Jonʹa·than.” And Jonʹa·than was selected.","Then Saul said to Jonʹa·than: “Tell me, what have you done?” So Jonʹa·than told him: “I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand. Here I am! I am ready to die!”","At this Saul said: “Thus may God do and may he add to it if you do not die, Jonʹa·than.”","But the people said to Saul: “Should Jonʹa·than die—the one who brought this great victory  to Israel? It is unthinkable! As surely as Jehovah is alive, not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground, for it was with God that he acted this day.” With that the people rescued  Jonʹa·than, and he did not die.","So Saul stopped pursuing the Phi·lisʹtines, and the Phi·lisʹtines went to their own territory.","Saul secured the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side, against the Moʹab·ites, the Amʹmon·ites, the Eʹdom·ites, the kings of Zoʹbah, and the Phi·lisʹtines; and wherever he went he defeated them.","And he fought bravely and conquered the A·malʹek·ites and rescued Israel from the hand of their plunderers.","The sons of Saul were Jonʹa·than, Ishʹvi, and Malʹchi-shuʹa. And he had two daughters; the name of the older one was Meʹrab, and the name of the younger one, Miʹchal.","The name of Saul’s wife was A·hinʹo·am the daughter of A·himʹa·az. The name of the chief of his army was Abʹner the son of Ner, the uncle of Saul.","Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abʹner was the son of A·biʹel.","There was fierce warfare with the Phi·lisʹtines all the days of Saul. When Saul saw any strong or courageous man, he would recruit him into his service."],["Then Samuel said to Saul: “Jehovah sent me to anoint you as king over his people Israel; now listen to what Jehovah has to say.","This is what Jehovah of armies says: ‘I will call to account the A·malʹek·ites for what they did to Israel when they opposed them along their way coming up from Egypt.","Now go, and strike down the A·malʹek·ites, and devote them to destruction along with all that they have. You must not spare  them; you are to put them to death, man as well as woman, child as well as infant, bull as well as sheep, camel as well as donkey.’”","Saul summoned the people and counted them in Te·laʹim: There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.","Saul advanced as far as the city of Amʹa·lek and set an ambush by the valley.","Saul then said to the Kenʹites: “Go, depart from among the A·malʹek·ites, so that I do not sweep you away with them. For you showed loyal love to all the people  of Israel at the time they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenʹites departed from the midst of Amʹa·lek.","After that Saul struck down the A·malʹek·ites from Havʹi·lah as far as Shur, which is next to Egypt.","He caught Aʹgag the king of Amʹa·lek alive, but all the other people he devoted to destruction with the sword.","However, Saul and the people spared  Aʹgag and the best of the flock, the herd, the fattened animals, the rams, and all that was good. They did not want to devote them to destruction. But all the goods that were worthless and unwanted, these they devoted to destruction.","Then the word of Jehovah came to Samuel:","“I regret  that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following me and he has not carried out my words.” Samuel became very upset, and he kept crying out to Jehovah all night long.","When Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul, Samuel was told: “Saul went to Carʹmel, and there he erected a monument for himself. Then he turned around and went down to Gilʹgal.”","When Samuel finally came to him, Saul said to him: “May Jehovah bless you. I have carried out the word of Jehovah.”","But Samuel said: “Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears and the sound of the cattle that I hear?”","To this Saul said: “They were brought from the A·malʹek·ites, because the people spared  the best of the flock and the herd for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God; but what was left we devoted to destruction.”","At this Samuel said to Saul: “Stop! Let me tell you what Jehovah said to me last night.” So he said to him: “Speak!”","Samuel continued: “Were you not insignificant in your own eyes when you were made head of the tribes of Israel and when Jehovah anointed you as king over Israel?","Jehovah later sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, and devote the sinful A·malʹek·ites to destruction. Fight against them until you have exterminated them.’","So why did you not obey the voice of Jehovah? Instead, you rushed greedily toward the spoil and did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah!”","However, Saul said to Samuel: “But I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah! I went on the mission to which Jehovah sent me, and I brought back Aʹgag the king of Amʹa·lek, and I devoted the A·malʹek·ites to destruction.","But the people took sheep and cattle from the spoil, the best of what was devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Jehovah your God at Gilʹgal.”","Samuel then said: “Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, and to pay attention than the fat of rams;","for rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination, and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using magical power and idolatry.  Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, he has rejected you from being king.”","Then Saul said to Samuel: “I have sinned, for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and listened to what they said.","And now,  please, pardon my sin, and return with me so that I may bow down to Jehovah.”","But Samuel said to Saul: “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from continuing as king over Israel.”","As Samuel was turning to go, Saul grabbed hold of the hem of his sleeveless coat, but it ripped away.","At this Samuel said to him: “Jehovah has ripped away the royal rule of Israel from you today, and he will give it to one of your fellow men who is better than you.","Moreover, the Excellency of Israel will not prove false or change his mind,  for He is not a mere man that he should change his mind.”","At this he said: “I have sinned. But honor me, please, in front of the elders of my people and in front of Israel. Return with me, and I will bow down to Jehovah your God.”","So Samuel returned behind Saul, and Saul bowed down to Jehovah.","And Samuel said: “Bring Aʹgag the king of Amʹa·lek near to me.” Then Aʹgag went to him reluctantly,  for Aʹgag had been saying to himself: ‘Surely the threat  of death is past.’","However, Samuel said: “Just as your sword has bereaved women of children, so your mother will be most bereaved among women.” With that Samuel hacked Aʹgag to pieces before Jehovah at Gilʹgal.","Samuel now went to Raʹmah, and Saul went up to his own house at Gibʹe·ah of Saul.","Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel went into mourning for Saul. And Jehovah regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."],["Jehovah eventually said to Samuel: “How long will you mourn for Saul now that I have rejected him from ruling as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesʹse the Bethʹle·hem·ite, because I have selected from among his sons a king for myself.”","But Samuel said: “How can I go? When Saul hears about it, he will kill me.” Jehovah replied: “Take a young cow with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.’","Invite Jesʹse to the sacrifice; then I will make known to you what to do. You must anoint for me the one whom I designate to you.”","Samuel did what Jehovah said. When he came to Bethʹle·hem, the elders of the city were trembling at meeting him, and they said: “Does your coming mean peace?”","To this he said: “It means peace. I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he sanctified Jesʹse and his sons, after which he summoned them to the sacrifice.","As they came in and he saw E·liʹab, he said: “Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.”","But Jehovah said to Samuel: “Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is, for I have rejected him. For the way man sees is not the way God sees, because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.”","Then Jesʹse called A·binʹa·dab and had him pass before Samuel, but he said: “Jehovah has not chosen this one either.”","Next Jesʹse presented Shamʹmah, but he said: “Jehovah has not chosen this one either.”","So Jesʹse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesʹse: “Jehovah has not chosen any of these.”","Finally Samuel said to Jesʹse: “Are these all of your boys?” To this he said: “The youngest has been left out until now; he is pasturing the sheep.” Then Samuel said to Jesʹse: “Send for him, because we will not sit down for the meal until he comes here.”","So he sent for him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and handsome in appearance. Then Jehovah said: “Get up, anoint him, for this is the one!”","So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David from that day forward. Samuel later rose and went his way to Raʹmah.","Now the spirit of Jehovah had departed from Saul, and a bad spirit from Jehovah terrorized him.","The servants of Saul said to him: “You see that a bad spirit from God is terrorizing you.","Let our lord, please, command your servants before you to look for a man who is skilled at playing the harp. Whenever a bad spirit from God comes upon you, he will play it, and you will feel better.”","So Saul said to his servants: “Find me, please, a man who plays well, and bring him to me.”","One of the attendants said: “Look! I have seen how a son of Jesʹse the Bethʹle·hem·ite plays skillfully, and he is a courageous, mighty warrior. He can speak well, and he is handsome, and Jehovah is with him.”","Saul then sent messengers to Jesʹse and said: “Send to me your son David, who is with the flock.”","So Jesʹse loaded a donkey with bread, a skin bottle of wine, and a young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David.","Thus David came to Saul and began serving him. Saul grew to love him very much, and he became his armor-bearer.","Saul sent a message to Jesʹse: “Please let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my eyes.”","Whenever a bad spirit from God came upon Saul, David took the harp and played it, and Saul found relief and felt better, and the bad spirit would depart from him."],["And the Phi·lisʹtines assembled their armies  for war. They assembled at Soʹcoh, which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Soʹcoh and A·zeʹkah, in Eʹphes-damʹmim.","Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley  of Eʹlah, and they drew up in battle formation to meet the Phi·lisʹtines.","The Phi·lisʹtines occupied the mountain on one side, and the Israelites occupied the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.","Then a champion came out from the camps of the Phi·lisʹtines; his name was Go·liʹath, from Gath, and his height was six cubits and a span.","He had a helmet of copper on his head, and he was wearing a coat of mail of overlapping scales. The weight of the copper coat of mail was 5,000 shekels.","He had shin guards of copper on his legs and a javelin of copper slung between his shoulders.","The wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels;  and his shield-bearer was marching ahead of him.","Then he stood and called out to the battle line  of Israel and said to them: “Why have you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Phi·lisʹtine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.","If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will then become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and serve us.”","The Phi·lisʹtine then said: “I do taunt  the battle line of Israel this day. Give me a man, and let us fight it out!”","When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Phi·lisʹtine, they became terrified and greatly afraid.","Now David was the son of the Ephʹrath·ite from Bethʹle·hem of Judah named Jesʹse, who had eight sons and who in the days of Saul was already an old man.","The three oldest sons of Jesʹse had followed Saul to the war. The names of his three sons who went to war were E·liʹab the firstborn, his second son A·binʹa·dab, and the third Shamʹmah.","David was the youngest, and the three oldest followed Saul.","David was going back and forth from Saul to tend the sheep of his father at Bethʹle·hem.","Meanwhile, the Phi·lisʹtine would come forward and take his position each morning and each evening for 40 days.","Then Jesʹse said to his son David: “Take, please, this eʹphah  of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers in the camp.","And take these ten portions of cheese  to the chief of the thousand; also, you should check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them.”","They were with Saul and all the other men of Israel in the Valley  of Eʹlah, fighting against the Phi·lisʹtines.","So David got up early in the morning and left someone in charge of the sheep; then he packed up and went just as Jesʹse had commanded him. When he came to the camp enclosure, the army was going out to the battle line, shouting a battle cry.","Israel and the Phi·lisʹtines drew up so that one battle line faced the other battle line.","David immediately left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he began asking about the welfare of his brothers.","While he was speaking with them, there came the champion named Go·liʹath, the Phi·lisʹtine from Gath. He came out from the battle line of the Phi·lisʹtines, and he spoke the same words as before, and David heard him.","When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him, terrified.","The men of Israel were saying: “Have you seen this man who is coming out? He comes to taunt  Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who strikes him down, he will give him his own daughter, and he will give the house of his father exemption in Israel.”","David began to say to the men who were standing near him: “What will be done for the man who strikes down that Phi·lisʹtine over there and takes away reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtine that he should taunt  the battle line of the living God?”","Then the people told  him the same thing as before: “This is what will be done for the man who strikes him down.”","When his oldest brother E·liʹab heard him speak to the men, he became angry with David and said: “Why have you come down? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I well know your presumptuousness and the bad intentions of your heart; you came down just to see the battle.”","To this David said: “What have I done now? I was only asking a question!”","So he turned from him toward someone else and asked the same thing as before, and the people gave him the same reply as before.","The words that David had spoken were overheard and reported to Saul. So he sent for him.","David said to Saul: “Let no one lose heart  because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Phi·lisʹtine.”","But Saul said to David: “You are not able to go fight against this Phi·lisʹtine, for you are but a boy, and he has been a soldier  from his youth.”","David then said to Saul: “Your servant became a shepherd of his father’s flock, and a lion came, also a bear, and each carried off a sheep from the flock.","I went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth. When it rose up against me, I grabbed it by its fur  and struck it down and put it to death.","Your servant struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtine will become like one of them, for he has taunted  the battle lines of the living God.”","Then David added: “Jehovah, who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear, he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of this Phi·lisʹtine.” At this Saul said to David: “Go, and may Jehovah be with you.”","Saul now clothed David with his garments. He put a copper helmet on his head, after which he clothed him with a coat of mail.","Then David strapped on his sword over his garments and tried to go but could not, for he was not used to them. David said to Saul: “I am unable to go in these things, for I am not used to them.” So David took them off.","He then took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the streambed  and placed them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag, and his sling was in his hand. And he began approaching the Phi·lisʹtine.","The Phi·lisʹtine came closer and closer to David, and his shield-bearer was ahead of him.","When the Phi·lisʹtine looked and saw David, he sneered at him in contempt because he was just a ruddy and handsome boy.","So the Phi·lisʹtine said to David: “Am I a dog, so that you are coming against me with sticks?” With that the Phi·lisʹtine cursed David by his gods.","The Phi·lisʹtine said to David: “Just come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.”","David replied to the Phi·lisʹtine: “You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I am coming against you in the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the battle line of Israel, whom you have taunted.","This very day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand, and I will strike you down  and cut off your head; and on this day I will give the corpses of the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth; and people of all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel.","And all those gathered here  will know that it is not with the sword or the spear that Jehovah saves, for the battle belongs to Jehovah, and he will give all of you into our hand.”","Then the Phi·lisʹtine rose and drew steadily closer to meet David, but David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Phi·lisʹtine.","David thrust his hand into his bag and took a stone from there and slung it. He struck the Phi·lisʹtine in the forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell facedown on the ground.","So David prevailed over the Phi·lisʹtine with a sling and a stone; he struck down the Phi·lisʹtine and put him to death, though there was no sword in David’s hand.","David continued running and stood over him. Then he took hold of the Phi·lisʹtine’s sword and pulled it out of its sheath and made sure that he was dead by cutting off his head with it. When the Phi·lisʹtines saw that their mighty one had died, they fled.","At that the men of Israel and of Judah rose and broke into shouting and pursued the Phi·lisʹtines all the way from the valley to the gates of Ekʹron, and the slain of the Phi·lisʹtines lay fallen along the road from Shaʹa·raʹim, as far as Gath and Ekʹron.","After the Israelites returned from hotly pursuing the Phi·lisʹtines, they pillaged their camps.","Then David took the head of the Phi·lisʹtine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put the Phi·lisʹtine’s weapons in his own tent.","At the moment that Saul saw David go out to meet the Phi·lisʹtine, he said to Abʹner, the chief of the army: “Whose son is this boy, Abʹner?” Abʹner replied: “As surely as you live,  O king, I do not know!”","The king said: “Find out whose son the young man is.”","So as soon as David returned from striking down the Phi·lisʹtine, Abʹner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Phi·lisʹtine in his hand.","Saul now said to him: “Whose son are you, boy?” to which David said: “The son of your servant Jesʹse the Bethʹle·hem·ite.”"],["As soon as David had finished speaking to Saul, Jonʹa·than and David became bound together in close friendship,  and Jonʹa·than began to love him as himself.","From that day, Saul kept David with him, and he did not allow him to return to his father’s house.","And Jonʹa·than and David made a covenant, because he loved him as himself.","Jonʹa·than took off the sleeveless coat that he wore and gave it to David, along with his gear, his sword, his bow, and his belt.","David began going out and was successful  wherever Saul would send him. So Saul put him in charge of the fighting men, and this pleased all the people and the servants of Saul.","When David and the others would return from striking down the Phi·lisʹtines, the women would come out from all the cities of Israel with song and dances  to meet King Saul with tambourines, with rejoicing, and with lutes.","The women who were celebrating would sing:","Saul became very angry, and this song displeased him, for he said: “They have credited David with tens of thousands, but to me they have credited thousands. The only thing left to give him is the kingship!”","From that day on, Saul was always looking at David suspiciously.","The next day a bad spirit from God gripped Saul, and he started to act strangely  inside the house, while David was playing music on the harp as on other occasions. Saul had a spear in his hand,","and he hurled the spear, saying to himself: ‘I will pin David to the wall!’ But David escaped from him twice.","Then Saul was afraid of David because Jehovah was with him but had departed from Saul.","So Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as chief of a thousand, and David would lead the army into battle.","David continued to have success  in all he did, and Jehovah was with him.","And when Saul saw that he was very successful, he became afraid of him.","But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he would lead them in their campaigns.","Saul later said to David: “Here is my oldest daughter Meʹrab. I will give her to you as a wife. However, you should continue to display your courage for me and fight the wars of Jehovah.” For Saul said to himself: ‘Do not let my hand come against him. Let the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines strike him.’","At this David said to Saul: “Who am I and who are my relatives, my father’s family in Israel, for me to become son-in-law to the king?”","However, when the time came to give Saul’s daughter Meʹrab to David, she had already been given to be the wife of Aʹdri·el the Me·holʹath·ite.","Now Saul’s daughter Miʹchal was in love with David, and it was reported to Saul, and this pleased him.","So Saul said: “I will give her to him to serve as a snare to him, so that the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines may come upon him.” Saul then said to David a second time: “You will form a marriage alliance with me  today.”","Further, Saul ordered his servants: “Speak to David secretly and say, ‘Look! The king is pleased with you, and all his servants are fond of you. So now form a marriage alliance with the king.’”","When Saul’s servants told David these things, David said: “Is it a trivial matter to you to form a marriage alliance with the king when I am a man poor and lightly esteemed?”","Then Saul’s servants reported to him: “These are the words that David spoke.”","At that Saul said: “This is what you should say to David, ‘The king does not want any bride price except 100 foreskins of the Phi·lisʹtines, to take revenge on the enemies of the king.’” For Saul was scheming to have David fall by the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.","So his servants reported these words to David, and it was pleasing to David to form a marriage alliance with the king. Before the allotted time,","David  went with his men and struck down 200 Phi·lisʹtine men, and David brought the full number of their foreskins to the king, to form a marriage alliance with the king. Therefore, Saul gave him his daughter Miʹchal as a wife.","Saul realized that Jehovah was with David and that his daughter Miʹchal loved him.","This made Saul even more afraid of David, and Saul became an enemy of David for the rest of his life.","The princes of the Phi·lisʹtines would go out to battle, but as often as they went out, David was more successful  than all the servants of Saul; and his name was highly esteemed."],["Saul later spoke to Jonʹa·than his son and to all his servants about putting David to death.","Since Saul’s son Jonʹa·than was very fond of David, Jonʹa·than told David: “My father Saul wants to have you put to death. Please be on your guard in the morning, and go to a secret place and remain hidden.","I will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you will be. I will talk about you to my father, and if I learn anything, I will be sure to tell you.”","So Jonʹa·than spoke well of David to his father Saul. He said to him: “The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you and what he has done for you has benefited you.","He risked his life  to strike down the Phi·lisʹtine, so that Jehovah brought about a great victory  for all Israel. You saw it, and you were overjoyed. So why should you sin against innocent blood in having David put to death for no reason?”","Saul listened to Jonʹa·than, and Saul swore: “As surely as Jehovah is living, he will not be put to death.”","Afterward Jonʹa·than called David and told him all these things. So Jonʹa·than brought David to Saul, and he continued to serve him as before.","In time war broke out again, and David went out and fought against the Phi·lisʹtines and struck them down with a great slaughter, and they fled from before him.","And a bad spirit from Jehovah came upon Saul when he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing music on the harp.","Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, who drove the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped during that night.","Saul later sent messengers to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning, but David’s wife Miʹchal told him: “If you do not escape  tonight, tomorrow you will be a dead man.”","Immediately Miʹchal let David down through the window, so that he could run away and escape.","Miʹchal took the teraphim statue  and placed it on the bed, and she put a net of goat hair at the place of his head, and she covered it with a garment.","Saul now sent messengers to take David, but she said: “He is sick.”","So Saul sent the messengers to see David and told them: “Bring him to me on his bed to have him put to death.”","When the messengers came in, there was the teraphim statue  on the bed and a net of goat hair where his head would have been.","Saul said to Miʹchal: “Why did you trick  me like this and send my enemy away so that he could escape?” Miʹchal replied to Saul: “He said to me, ‘Send me away, or I will kill you!’”","Now David had run away and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Raʹmah. He told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went away, and they stayed in Naiʹoth.","In time it was reported to Saul: “Look! David is in Naiʹoth in Raʹmah.”","At once Saul sent messengers to seize David. When they saw the elderly ones of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the spirit of God came to be upon Saul’s messengers, and they began behaving as prophets as well.","When they told it to Saul, he immediately sent other messengers, and they too began behaving as prophets. So Saul sent messengers again, a third group, and they too began behaving as prophets.","Finally he also went to Raʹmah. When he reached the great cistern that is in Seʹcu, he asked: “Where are Samuel and David?” They replied: “There in Naiʹoth in Raʹmah.”","While Saul was on his way from there to Naiʹoth in Raʹmah, the spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along behaving as a prophet until he came into Naiʹoth in Raʹmah.","He also stripped off his garments, and he too behaved as a prophet before Samuel, and he lay there naked  all that day and all that night. That is why they say: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”"],["Then David ran away from Naiʹoth in Raʹmah. However, he came to Jonʹa·than and said: “What have I done? What is my offense, and how have I sinned against your father for him to seek my life?”","At this Jonʹa·than said to him: “It is unthinkable! You will not die. Look! My father will not do anything, great or small, without disclosing it to me. Why should my father hide this matter from me? This will not happen.”","But David swore further and said: “Your father surely knows that I have found favor in your eyes and would say, ‘Do not let Jonʹa·than know this or he will be upset.’ But as surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as you are  living, there is only a step between me and death!”","Then Jonʹa·than said to David: “Whatever you say,  I will do for you.”","David said to Jonʹa·than: “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to sit with the king to eat; you must send me away, and I will hide in the field until the evening on the third day.","If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David begged me for permission to go quickly to his city Bethʹle·hem, because there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’","If his response is, ‘That is fine,’ it means peace to your servant. But if he becomes angry, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.","Show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into Jehovah’s covenant with you. But if I am guilty, put me to death yourself. Why turn me over to your father?”","To this Jonʹa·than said: “It is unthinkable to suggest that about you! If I learn that my father is determined to harm you, would I not tell you?”","Then David said to Jonʹa·than: “Who will tell me whether your father  gives you a harsh answer?”","Jonʹa·than said to David: “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field.","And Jonʹa·than said to David: “Let Jehovah the God of Israel be a witness that I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow or by the third day. If he is favorably disposed toward David, will I not then send you word and disclose it to you?","But if my father intends to harm you, may Jehovah do that and more to Jonʹa·than if I do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace. May Jehovah be with you, just as he was with my father.","And will you not show me the loyal love of Jehovah while I am alive and even when I die?","Never withdraw your loyal love from my household, even when Jehovah wipes out all the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”","So Jonʹa·than made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “Jehovah will require it and call David’s enemies to account.”","So Jonʹa·than had David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved himself.","Jonʹa·than then said to him: “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be vacant.","By the third day, you will be missed even more, and you must go to the place where you hid the other day  and stay near the stone here.","I will then shoot three arrows to one side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.","When I send the attendant, I will say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the attendant, ‘Look! The arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then you may come back, for as surely as Jehovah is living, it means everything is peaceful for you and there is no danger.","But if I should say to the boy, ‘Look! The arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for Jehovah has sent you away.","As for the promise that we have made, you and I, may Jehovah be between us forever.”","So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king took his seat at the meal to eat.","The king was sitting in his usual seat by the wall. Jonʹa·than was facing him, and Abʹner was sitting at Saul’s side, but David’s place was vacant.","Saul did not say anything that day, for he said to himself: ‘Something has happened so that he is not clean. Yes, he must be unclean.’","And the day after the new moon, on the second day, David’s place continued vacant. Saul then said to Jonʹa·than his son: “Why has the son of Jesʹse not come to the meal either yesterday or today?”","Jonʹa·than answered Saul: “David begged me for permission to go to Bethʹle·hem.","He said, ‘Please permit me to go, because we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my own brother summoned me. So if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”","Then Saul became enraged with Jonʹa·than, and he said to him: “You son of a rebellious woman, do you think I do not know that you are choosing to side with the son of Jesʹse, to your own shame and to the shame of your mother?","As long as the son of Jesʹse is alive on the earth, you and your kingship will not be firmly established. So now send someone  to bring him to me, for he must die.”","However, Jonʹa·than said to Saul his father: “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”","At that Saul hurled the spear at him to strike him, so Jonʹa·than knew that his father was determined to put David to death.","Jonʹa·than immediately rose up from the table in the heat of anger, and he did not eat any food on the second day after the new moon, for he was upset over David and his own father had humiliated him.","In the morning Jonʹa·than went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a young attendant was with him.","And he said to his attendant: “Please run and find the arrows that I shoot.” The attendant ran, and Jonʹa·than shot the arrow beyond him.","When the attendant reached the place where Jonʹa·than had shot the arrow, Jonʹa·than called out to the attendant: “Is not the arrow beyond you?”","Jonʹa·than called out to the attendant: “Hurry! Go quickly! Do not delay!” And Jonʹa·than’s attendant picked up the arrows and came back to his master.","The attendant did not understand anything about the matter; only Jonʹa·than and David knew what was meant.","Then Jonʹa·than gave his weapons to his attendant and told him: “Go, take them to the city.”","When the attendant left, David rose up from a place nearby that was to the south. Then he fell with his face to the ground and bowed three times, and they kissed each other and wept for each other, but David wept the most.","Jonʹa·than said to David: “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying, ‘May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring  and my offspring  forever.’”"],["David later came to Nob to A·himʹe·lech the priest. A·himʹe·lech began to tremble when he met David, and he said to him: “Why are you by yourself and no one is with you?”","David replied to A·himʹe·lech the priest: “The king instructed me to do something, but he said, ‘Do not let anyone know anything about the mission on which I am sending you and about the instructions I have given you.’ I made an appointment with my young men to meet at a certain place.","Now if there are five loaves of bread at your disposal, just give them to me, or whatever is available.”","But the priest answered David: “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is holy bread—provided that the young men have kept away from women.”","David answered the priest: “Women have certainly been kept away from us as on previous occasions when I went out on a campaign. If the bodies of the young men are holy even when the mission is ordinary, how much more so today should they be holy!”","So the priest gave him the holy bread, because there was no bread there except the showbread, which had been removed from Jehovah’s presence to be replaced by fresh bread on the day it was taken away.","Now one of Saul’s servants was there on that day, detained before Jehovah. His name was Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.","David then said to A·himʹe·lech: “Is there a spear or a sword here at your disposal? I did not take my own sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s mission was urgent.”","To this the priest said: “The sword of Go·liʹath the Phi·lisʹtine, whom you struck down in the Valley  of Eʹlah, is here, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephʹod. If you want to take it for yourself, take it, because it is the only one here.” David said: “There is none like it. Give it to me.”","That day David rose up and continued his flight from Saul, and he eventually came to King Aʹchish of Gath.","The servants of Aʹchish said to him: “Is this not David, the king of the land? Is he not the one they sang about when they danced, saying,","David took these words to heart, and he became very much afraid of King Aʹchish of Gath.","So he disguised his sanity in their presence and acted insane while among them.  He was making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard.","Finally Aʹchish said to his servants: “You see that this man is crazy! Why bring him to me?","Do I have a shortage of crazy men that I need to have this one acting crazy before me? Should this man enter my house?”"],["So David went from there, escaping to the cave of A·dulʹlam. When his brothers and his father’s entire house heard of it, they went down there to him.","And all those who were in trouble and in debt and who had a grievance  gathered to him, and he became their chief. There were about 400 men with him.","David later went from there to Mizʹpeh in Moʹab and said to the king of Moʹab: “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.”","So he left them with the king of Moʹab, and they stayed with him the whole time that David was in the stronghold.","In time Gad the prophet said to David: “Do not stay in the stronghold. Go from there into the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Heʹreth.","Saul heard that David and the men with him had been found. Saul was then sitting in Gibʹe·ah under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were stationed around him.","Then Saul said to his servants stationed around him: “Listen, please, you Benʹja·min·ites. Will the son of Jesʹse also give fields and vineyards to all of you? Will he appoint all of you as chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds?","All of you have conspired against me! No one informed me when my own son made a covenant with the son of Jesʹse! Not one of you has sympathy for me and informs me that my own son has incited my own servant against me to ambush me, as is now the case.”","Then Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite, who was stationed there over the servants of Saul, answered: “I saw the son of Jesʹse come to Nob to A·himʹe·lech the son of A·hiʹtub.","And he inquired of Jehovah for him and gave him provisions. He even gave him the sword of Go·liʹath the Phi·lisʹtine.”","At once the king sent for A·himʹe·lech son of A·hiʹtub the priest and all the priests of his father’s house, who were in Nob. So all of them came to the king.","Saul now said: “Listen, please, you son of A·hiʹtub!” to which he replied: “Here I am, my lord.”","Saul said to him: “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesʹse, by giving him bread and a sword and by making an inquiry of God for him? He opposes me and waits in ambush, as is now the case.”","At this A·himʹe·lech answered the king: “Who among all your servants is as trustworthy  as David? He is the king’s son-in-law and a chief over your bodyguard and honored in your house.","Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? What you are saying is unthinkable on my part! Do not let the king hold anything against his servant and against my father’s entire house, for your servant did not know a single thing about any of this.”","But the king said: “You will surely die, A·himʹe·lech, you along with all your father’s house.”","With that the king said to the guards  stationed around him: “Turn and kill the priests of Jehovah, because they have sided with David! They knew that he was a runaway, and they did not inform me!” But the king’s servants did not want to lift their hands to assault the priests of Jehovah.","Then the king said to Doʹeg: “You turn and assault the priests!” Immediately Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite went and assaulted the priests himself. He killed on that day 85 men wearing the linen ephʹod.","He also struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword; man as well as woman, child as well as infant, bull, donkey, and sheep, he put to the sword.","However, one son of A·himʹe·lech the son of A·hiʹtub, whose name was A·biʹa·thar, escaped and ran away to follow David.","A·biʹa·thar told David: “Saul has killed the priests of Jehovah.”","At this David said to A·biʹa·thar: “I knew on that day, when Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite was there, that he would be sure to tell Saul. I am personally responsible for the death of everyone  in your father’s house.","Stay with me. Do not be afraid, for whoever seeks your life  seeks my life;  you are under my protection.”"],["In time David was told: “The Phi·lisʹtines are fighting against Keiʹlah, and they are raiding the threshing floors.”","So David inquired of Jehovah: “Should I go and strike down these Phi·lisʹtines?” Jehovah said to David: “Go, strike down the Phi·lisʹtines and rescue Keiʹlah.”","But the men of David said to him: “Look! We are afraid while here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Keiʹlah against the battle line of the Phi·lisʹtines!”","So David inquired once again of Jehovah. Jehovah now answered him: “Rise up; go down to Keiʹlah because I will give the Phi·lisʹtines into your hand.”","So David went with his men to Keiʹlah and fought against the Phi·lisʹtines; he carried off their livestock and struck them down with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keiʹlah.","Now when A·biʹa·thar the son of A·himʹe·lech ran away to David at Keiʹlah, he had an ephʹod with him.","Saul was told:  “David has come to Keiʹlah.” Then Saul said: “God has handed him over to me,  for he has trapped himself by entering a city with gates and bars.”","So Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keiʹlah and besiege David and his men.","When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to A·biʹa·thar the priest: “Bring the ephʹod here.”","Then David said: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, your servant has indeed heard that Saul intends to come to Keiʹlah to destroy the city because of me.","Will the leaders  of Keiʹlah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Jehovah the God of Israel, please tell your servant.” To this Jehovah said: “He will come down.”","David asked: “Will the leaders of Keiʹlah surrender me and my men into Saul’s hand?” Jehovah replied: “They will surrender you.”","At once David rose up with his men, about 600 in number, and they left Keiʹlah and moved about wherever they could. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keiʹlah, he did not go out after him.","David stayed in the wilderness in places difficult to approach, in the mountainous region of the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him constantly, but Jehovah did not give him into his hand.","David was aware that  Saul had gone out to seek his life  while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Hoʹresh.","Jonʹa·than the son of Saul now went out to David at Hoʹresh, and he helped him find strength  in Jehovah.","He said to him: “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will not find you; you will be king over Israel, and I will become second to you; and my father Saul also knows that.”","Then the two of them made a covenant before Jehovah, and David stayed in Hoʹresh, and Jonʹa·than went to his home.","The men of Ziph later went up to Saul at Gibʹe·ah and said: “Is not David hiding near us in the places difficult to approach at Hoʹresh, on the hill of Hach·iʹlah, which is south  of Je·shiʹmon?","Whenever it pleases you  to come down, O king, come, and we will surrender him into the hand of the king.”","At this Saul said: “May you be blessed by Jehovah, for you have shown compassion to me.","Please go and try to find out exactly where he is and who saw him there, for I have been told that he is very cunning.","Carefully ascertain where all his hiding places are and return to me with the evidence. I will then go with you, and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands  of Judah.”","So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul, while David and his men were in the wilderness of Maʹon, in the Arʹa·bah to the south of Je·shiʹmon.","Then Saul came with his men to look for him. When David was told, he at once went down to the crag and stayed in the wilderness of Maʹon. When Saul heard this, he chased after David into the wilderness of Maʹon.","As Saul came to one side  of the mountain, David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.","But a messenger came to Saul, saying: “Come quickly, for the Phi·lisʹtines have made a raid on the land!”","At that Saul stopped chasing after David and went to confront the Phi·lisʹtines. That is why that place was named the Crag of the Divisions.","Then David made his way up from there and stayed in the places difficult to approach at En-gedʹi."],["As soon as Saul returned from pursuing the Phi·lisʹtines, they told him: “Look! David is in the wilderness of En-gedʹi.”","So Saul took 3,000 men chosen from all Israel and went to look for David and his men on the rocky cliffs of the mountain goats.","Saul came to the stone sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself  while David and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of the cave.","David’s men said to him: “This is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you, ‘Look! I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.’” So David rose up and quietly cut off the edge of Saul’s sleeveless coat.","But afterward David’s heart  kept striking him because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s sleeveless coat.","He said to his men: “It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint that I should do such a thing to my lord, the anointed of Jehovah, by lifting my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.”","So David restrained  his men with these words, and he did not allow them to attack Saul. As for Saul, he rose up from the cave and went on his way.","Then David got up and went out from the cave and called out after Saul: “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.","David said to Saul: “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look! David is seeking to harm you’?","This very day your own eyes have seen how Jehovah gave you into my hand in the cave. But when someone said to kill you, I had pity on you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.’","And look, my father, yes, see the edge of your sleeveless coat in my hand; for when I cut off the edge of your sleeveless coat, I did not kill you. You can now see and understand that I do not intend to harm you or to rebel, and I have not sinned against you, whereas you are hunting me down to take my life.","May Jehovah judge between you and me, and may Jehovah take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will not come against you.","Just as the ancient proverb says, ‘From the wicked comes wickedness,’ but my hand will not come against you.","After whom has the king of Israel gone out? Whom are you chasing? A dead dog? A single flea?","May Jehovah be the judge, and he will judge between you and me, and he will see and will plead my case and judge me and rescue me from your hand.”","At the moment that David finished speaking these words to him, Saul said: “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul began to weep loudly.","He said to David: “You are more righteous than I am, for you have treated me well and I have repaid you with evil.","Yes, today you have told me of the good you did by not killing me when Jehovah surrendered me into your hand.","For what man finds his enemy and sends him on his way unharmed? Jehovah will reward you with good because of what you have done for me today.","And now look! I know that you will surely rule as king and that in your hand the kingdom of Israel will endure.","Now swear to me by Jehovah that you will not wipe out my descendants  after me and that you will not annihilate my name out of my father’s house.”","So David swore to Saul, after which Saul went home. But David and his men went up to the stronghold."],["In time Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together to mourn for him and to bury him at his house in Raʹmah. Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paʹran.","Now there was a man in Maʹon whose work was in Carʹmel.  The man was very wealthy; he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and he was then shearing his sheep at Carʹmel.","The man’s name was Naʹbal, and his wife’s name was Abʹi·gail. The wife was discerning and beautiful, but the husband, a Caʹleb·ite, was harsh, and he behaved badly.","David heard in the wilderness that Naʹbal was shearing his sheep.","So David sent ten young men to him, and David told the young men: “Go up to Carʹmel, and when you come to Naʹbal, ask him in my name about his welfare.","Then say, ‘May you live long and may you be well  and may your household be well and may all that you have be well.","Now I hear that you are doing your shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harm them, and they found nothing missing the whole time they were in Carʹmel.","Ask your young men, and they will tell you. May my young men find favor in your eyes, because we have come at a joyous time.  Please give to your servants and to your son David whatever you can spare.’”","So David’s young men went and told all of this to Naʹbal in David’s name. When they finished,","Naʹbal answered David’s servants: “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesʹse? Nowadays many servants are breaking away from their masters.","Do I have to take my bread and my water and the meat that I butchered for my shearers and give it to men who come from who knows where?”","At that David’s young men returned and reported all these words to him.","David immediately said to his men: “Everyone strap on your sword!” So they all strapped on their swords, and David also strapped on his own sword, and about 400 men went up with David, while 200 men stayed with the baggage.","Meanwhile, one of the servants reported to Abʹi·gail, Naʹbal’s wife: “Look! David sent messengers from the wilderness to wish our master well, but he screamed insults at them.","Those men were  very good to us. They never harmed us, and we did not miss a single thing the whole time we were together with them in the fields.","They were like a protective wall around us, both by night and by day, the whole time we were with them shepherding the flock.","Now decide what you are going to do, for disaster has been determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless  man that no one can speak to him.”","So Abʹi·gail quickly took 200 loaves of bread, two large jars of wine, five dressed sheep, five seah measures  of roasted grain, 100 cakes of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs and put all of it on the donkeys.","Then she said to her servants: “Go on ahead of me; I will follow you.” But she said nothing to her husband Naʹbal.","While she was riding on the donkey and going down under cover of the mountain, just then David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.","Now David had been saying: “It was for nothing that I guarded everything that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness. Not a single thing belonging to him went missing, and yet he repays me evil for good.","May God do the same and more to the enemies of David  if I allow a single male  of his to survive until the morning.”","When Abʹi·gail caught sight of David, she hurried down off the donkey and threw herself facedown before David, bowing to the ground.","She then fell at his feet and said: “My lord, let the blame be on me; let your servant girl speak to you, and listen to the words of your servant girl.","Please, do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless Naʹbal, for he is just like his name. Naʹbal  is his name, and senselessness is with him. But I, your servant girl, did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent.","And now, my lord, as surely as Jehovah is living and as you are  living, it is Jehovah who has held you back from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge  with your own hand. May your enemies and those seeking injury to my lord become like Naʹbal.","Now let this gift  that your servant girl has brought to my lord be given to the young men who are following my lord.","Pardon, please, the transgression of your servant girl, for Jehovah will without fail make for my lord a lasting house, because my lord is fighting the wars of Jehovah, and no evil has been found in you all your days.","When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life,  the life  of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of life with Jehovah your God, but the lives  of your enemies he will hurl away like stones from a sling.","And when Jehovah has done for my lord all the good things he has promised and he appoints you as leader over Israel,","you will have no remorse or regret  in your heart for shedding blood without cause and for letting the hand of my lord take revenge.  When Jehovah confers  good upon my lord, remember your servant girl.”","At this David said to Abʹi·gail: “Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!","And blessed be your good sense! May you be blessed for restraining me this day from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge  with my own hands.","Otherwise, as surely as Jehovah the God of Israel who held me back from harming you is living, if you had not come quickly to meet me, by morning there would not have remained a single male  belonging to Naʹbal.”","With that David accepted from her what she had brought him and said to her: “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to you, and I will grant your request.”","Abʹi·gail later went back to Naʹbal, who was feasting like a king in his house, and Naʹbal  was in a good mood and was as drunk as could be. She did not tell him a single thing until the morning light.","In the morning, when Naʹbal was sober, his wife told him these things. And his heart became like a dead man’s, and he lay paralyzed like a stone.","About ten days later, Jehovah struck Naʹbal, and he died.","When David heard that Naʹbal had died, he said: “Praise Jehovah, who has pleaded my case of reproach from Naʹbal and has kept his servant from doing anything bad, and Jehovah has brought the badness of Naʹbal back on his own head!” Then David sent word to propose to Abʹi·gail to take her as his wife.","So David’s servants came to Abʹi·gail at Carʹmel and said to her: “David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.”","She immediately rose up and bowed with her face to the ground and said: “Here is your slave as a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”","Then Abʹi·gail quickly rose up and rode on her donkey with five of her female servants walking behind her; she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife.","David had also married A·hinʹo·am from Jezʹre·el, and both women became his wives.","But Saul had given his daughter Miʹchal, David’s wife, to Palʹti the son of Laʹish, who was from Galʹlim."],["In time the men of Ziph came to Saul at Gibʹe·ah, saying: “Is David not hiding on the hill of Hach·iʹlah facing Je·shiʹmon?”","So Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with 3,000 chosen men of Israel to look for David in the wilderness of Ziph.","Saul camped on the hill of Hach·iʹlah, which faces Je·shiʹmon, by the road. David was then living in the wilderness, and he learned that Saul had come into the wilderness after him.","So David sent spies to verify that Saul had indeed come.","David later went to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul and Abʹner the son of Ner, the chief of his army, were lying asleep; Saul lay asleep in the camp enclosure with the troops camping all around him.","Then David said to A·himʹe·lech the Hitʹtite and A·bishʹai the son of Ze·ruʹiah, the brother of Joʹab: “Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” A·bishʹai replied: “I will  go down with you.”","So David and A·bishʹai made their way to the troops by night, and they found Saul lying asleep in the camp enclosure with his spear stuck into the ground next to his head; Abʹner and the troops were lying all around him.","A·bishʹai now said to David: “Today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand. And now, please, let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once, and I will not need to do it twice.”","However, David said to A·bishʹai: “Do not harm him, for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent?”","David continued: “As surely as Jehovah is living, Jehovah himself will strike him down, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and perish.","It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah! So now take, please, the spear next to his head and the water jug, and let us be on our way.”","So David took the spear and the water jug from next to Saul’s head, and they went away. No one saw or noticed them or woke up, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.","Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain some distance away, with a considerable space between them.","David called out to the troops and to Abʹner the son of Ner, saying: “Abʹner, will you not answer?” Abʹner answered: “Who are you who calls to the king?”","David said to Abʹner: “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? So why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the soldiers came in to do away with your lord the king.","What you have done is not good. As surely as Jehovah is living, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the anointed of Jehovah. Now look around! Where are the king’s spear and the water jug that were next to his head?”","Then Saul recognized the voice of David and said: “Is this your voice, my son David?” David replied: “It is my voice, my lord the king.”","He added: “Why is my lord chasing after his servant, for what have I done, and what am I guilty of?","My lord the king, please, listen to the words of his servant: If it is Jehovah who incited you against me, let him accept  my grain offering. But if men have incited you, they are cursed before Jehovah, because they have driven me away today from being united with Jehovah’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’","And now do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of Jehovah, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a single flea, as if he were chasing a partridge on the mountains.”","In turn Saul said: “I have sinned. Come back, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because you regarded my life  as precious this day. Yes, I have acted foolishly and have made a terrible mistake.”","David answered: “Here is the spear of the king. Let one of the young men come over and take it.","It is Jehovah who will repay each one for his own righteousness and his own faithfulness, for today Jehovah gave you into my hand, but I was unwilling to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah.","Look! Just as your life  was  precious to me this day, so may my life  be precious in the eyes of Jehovah, and may he rescue me out of all distress.”","Saul replied to David: “May you be blessed, my son David. You will surely do great things, and you will surely prevail.” Then David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."],["However, David said in his heart: “One day I will perish by Saul’s hand. The best thing for me is to escape to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines; then Saul will give up looking for me in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.”","So David rose up with the 600 men who were with him and went over to Aʹchish the son of Maʹoch, the king of Gath.","David stayed with Aʹchish in Gath, he and his men, each man with his household. With David were his two wives, A·hinʹo·am of Jezʹre·el and Abʹi·gail the Carʹmel·ite, Naʹbal’s widow.","When report was made to Saul that David had run away to Gath, he stopped searching for him.","Then David said to Aʹchish: “If I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities of the countryside, so that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”","So Aʹchish gave him Zikʹlag on that day. That is why Zikʹlag belongs to the kings of Judah down to this day.","The length of time  that David lived in the countryside of the Phi·lisʹtines was a year and four months.","David would go up with his men to raid the Geshʹur·ites, the Girʹzites, and the A·malʹek·ites, for they were inhabiting the land that extended from Teʹlam as far as Shur and down to the land of Egypt.","When David would attack the land, he preserved neither man nor woman alive, but he took the flocks, herds, donkeys, camels, and clothing, after which he would return to Aʹchish.","Then Aʹchish would ask: “Where did you make a raid today?” David would reply: “Against the south  of Judah” or “Against the south of the Je·rahʹme·el·ites” or “Against the south of the Kenʹites.”","David did not spare alive any man or woman to be brought to Gath, saying: “That they may not tell them about us and say, ‘This is what David did.’” (And that was his practice the whole time he lived in the countryside of the Phi·lisʹtines.)","So Aʹchish believed David, saying to himself: ‘He has certainly become a stench among his people Israel, so he will always be my servant.’"],["In those days the Phi·lisʹtines assembled their armies for war against Israel. So Aʹchish said to David: “You know, of course, that you and your men will go out into battle with me.”","At that David said to Aʹchish: “You surely know what your servant will do.” Aʹchish said to David: “That is why I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard.”","Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned him and had buried him in Raʹmah, his own city. And Saul had removed the spirit mediums and the fortune-tellers from the land.","The Phi·lisʹtines assembled and went and set up camp in Shuʹnem. So Saul assembled all Israel, and they set up camp in Gil·boʹa.","When Saul saw the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines, he  was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.","Although Saul would inquire of Jehovah, Jehovah never answered him, either in dreams or by the Uʹrim or through the prophets.","Finally Saul said to his servants: “Find me a woman who is a spirit medium, and I will go and consult her.” His servants replied: “Look! There is a woman who is a spirit medium in En-dor.”","So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went to the woman by night with two of his men. He said: “Use divination, please, by acting as a spirit medium, and bring up for me the one whom I designate to you.”","However, the woman said to him: “You must know what Saul did, how he removed the spirit mediums and the fortune-tellers from the land. Why, then, are you trying to trap me  to have me put to death?”","Saul then swore to her by Jehovah, saying: “As surely as Jehovah is alive, you will not incur any guilt in this matter!”","At this the woman said: “Whom should I bring up for you?” He replied: “Bring up Samuel for me.”","When the woman saw “Samuel,”  she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul: “Why did you trick me? You are Saul!”","The king said to her: “Do not be afraid, but what do you see?” The woman replied to Saul: “I see one like a god coming up out of the earth.”","At once he asked her: “What does he look like?” to which she said: “It is an old man coming up, and he is clothed in a sleeveless coat.” At that Saul realized that it was “Samuel,” and he bowed low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.","Then “Samuel” said to Saul: “Why have you disturbed me by having me brought up?” Saul replied: “I am in great trouble. The Phi·lisʹtines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me and no longer answers me, either through the prophets or in dreams; so that is why I am calling on you to let me know what I should do.”","And “Samuel” said: “Why do you inquire of me now that Jehovah has departed from you and has become your adversary?","Jehovah will do for himself what he foretold through me: Jehovah will rip the kingdom out of your hands and give it to one of your fellow men, David.","Because you did not obey the voice of Jehovah and you did not execute his burning anger against the A·malʹek·ites, that is why Jehovah is doing this to you this day.","Jehovah will also give both Israel and you into the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Jehovah will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","At once Saul fell full length on the ground and became very much afraid because of “Samuel’s” words. And there was no strength left in him, because he had not eaten food all day and all night.","When the woman came to Saul and saw that he had been greatly disturbed, she said to him: “Here your servant has obeyed what you said, and I risked my life  and did what you told me to do.","Now, please, listen to what your servant has to say. Let me set before you a piece of bread; then eat so that you will have some strength to go on your way.”","But he refused and said: “I am not going to  eat.” However, his servants and also the woman kept urging him. Finally he listened to them and got up from the ground and sat on the bed.","The woman had a fattened calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered  it and took flour and kneaded dough and baked it into unleavened bread.","She served them to Saul and his servants, and they ate. After that they rose up and left during the night."],["The Phi·lisʹtines assembled all their armies at Aʹphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezʹre·el.","And the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines were passing by with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men were marching at the rear with Aʹchish.","But the princes of the Phi·lisʹtines said: “Why are these Hebrews here?” Aʹchish replied to the princes of the Phi·lisʹtines: “This is David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for a year or more. I have not found any fault in him from the day he deserted to me until today.”","But the princes of the Phi·lisʹtines became indignant at him, and they said to him: “Make the man go back. Let him return to the place where you assigned him. Do not let him go down with us into the battle, so that he will not turn against us during the battle. For what better way to put himself in favor with his lord than with the heads of our men?","Is this not the David about whom they sang when they danced, saying:","So Aʹchish summoned David and said to him: “As surely as Jehovah is living, you are upright, and I am pleased to have you go on the campaign with my army, for I have not found any fault with you from the day you came to me until today. But the lords do not trust you.","So return in peace, and do not do anything to displease the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","However, David said to Aʹchish: “Why, what have I done? What fault have you found in your servant from the day that I came to you until today? Why should I not come with you and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”","Aʹchish answered David: “From my standpoint, you have been as good as an angel of God. But the princes of the Phi·lisʹtines have said, ‘Do not let him go up with us into the battle.’","Now get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you; rise up and leave early in the morning as soon as it is light.”","So David and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines, and the Phi·lisʹtines went up to Jezʹre·el."],["When David and his men came to Zikʹlag on the third day, the A·malʹek·ites had made a raid on the south  and on Zikʹlag, and they had attacked Zikʹlag and burned it with fire.","They had taken captive the women and all who were in it, from the smallest to the greatest. They had not killed anyone, but they had carried them off and gone on their way.","When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been carried off captive.","So David and the men with him began  weeping loudly until they had no strength left to weep.","David’s two wives had also been carried off captive, A·hinʹo·am of Jezʹre·el and Abʹi·gail the widow of Naʹbal the Carʹmel·ite.","David was very distressed, because the men were talking of stoning him, for all the men  had become very bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself by Jehovah his God.","David then said to A·biʹa·thar the priest, the son of A·himʹe·lech: “Please bring the ephʹod here.” So A·biʹa·thar brought the ephʹod to David.","David inquired of Jehovah: “Should I chase after this marauder band? Will I overtake them?” At this He said to him: “Go in pursuit, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will make the rescue.”","David immediately set out with the 600 men who were with him, and they went on as far as the Wadi  Beʹsor, where some of the men stayed behind.","David kept up the chase with 400 men, but the 200 men who were too tired to cross the Wadi Beʹsor stayed behind.","They found an Egyptian man in the field and took him to David. They gave him food to eat and water to drink,","as well as a slice of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. After he ate, he regained his strength,  for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.","David now asked him: “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” to which he said: “I am an Egyptian attendant, a slave of an A·malʹek·ite man, but my master left me because I got sick three days ago.","We made a raid on the south  of the Cherʹe·thites and on the territory of Judah and on the south  of Caʹleb, and Zikʹlag we burned with fire.”","At this David said to him: “Will you lead me down to this marauder band?” He replied: “If you swear to me by God that you will not put me to death and that you will not hand me over to my master, I will lead you down to this marauder band.”","So he led him down to where they were spread out all over the land, eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Phi·lisʹtines and the land of Judah.","Then David struck them down from the morning darkness until the following evening; not a man escaped except 400 men who fled on camels.","David recovered all that the A·malʹek·ites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.","Nothing of theirs was missing, from the smallest to the greatest. They recovered their sons and daughters and the spoil; David recovered everything that they had taken.","So David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before their own livestock. They said: “This is David’s spoil.”","Then David came to the 200 men who had been too tired to go along with David and who had stayed behind by the Wadi Beʹsor, and they came out to meet David and the people with him. When David came near to the men, he asked them how they were.","However, every bad and worthless man among those who had gone with David said: “Since they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we  recovered except that each one may take his wife and his sons and go away.”","But David said: “You must not do this, my brothers, with what Jehovah has given us. He protected us and gave into our hand the marauder band that came against us.","Who would agree with you on this? The share of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the share of the one who sat by the baggage. All will have a share together.”","And from that day forward, he kept it set as a regulation and a rule for Israel down to this day.","When David returned to Zikʹlag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying: “Here is a gift  for you from the spoil of Jehovah’s enemies.”","He sent it to those who were in Bethʹel, to those in Raʹmoth of the Negʹeb,  to those in Jatʹtir,","to those in A·roʹer, to those in Siphʹmoth, to those in Esh·te·moʹa,","to those in Raʹcal, to those in the cities of the Je·rahʹme·el·ites, to those in the cities of the Kenʹites,","to those in Horʹmah, to those in Borʹa·shan, to those in Aʹthach,","to those in Hebʹron, and to all the places that David and his men had frequented."],["Now the Phi·lisʹtines were fighting against Israel. And the men of Israel fled from before the Phi·lisʹtines, and many fell slain on Mount Gil·boʹa.","The Phi·lisʹtines kept in close range of Saul and his sons, and the Phi·lisʹtines struck down Jonʹa·than, A·binʹa·dab, and Malʹchi-shuʹa, Saul’s sons.","The fighting grew fierce against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.","Then Saul said to his armor-bearer: “Draw your sword and run me through with it, so that these uncircumcised men may not come and run me through and deal ruthlessly  with me.” But his armor-bearer was unwilling, because he was very much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it.","When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him.","Thus Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together on that day.","When the people of Israel who were in the region of the valley  and in the region of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they began to abandon the cities and flee; the Phi·lisʹtines then came and occupied them.","The next day, when the Phi·lisʹtines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gil·boʹa.","So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent word throughout the land of the Phi·lisʹtines to spread the news in the houses  of their idols and among the people.","Then they put his armor in the house of the Ashʹto·reth images and fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth-shan.","When the inhabitants of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad heard what the Phi·lisʹtines had done to Saul,","all the warriors rose and traveled all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons off the wall of Beth-shan. They returned to Jaʹbesh and burned them there.","Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jaʹbesh, and they fasted for seven days."]],"2 Samuel":[["After Saul’s death, when David had returned from defeating  the A·malʹek·ites, David stayed at Zikʹlag for two days.","On the third day, a man came from the camp of Saul with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head. When he approached David, he fell down to the ground and prostrated himself.","David asked him: “Where are you coming from?” He replied: “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”","David asked him: “How did things turn out? Please tell me.” To this he said: “The people have fled from the battle and many have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonʹa·than have died.”","Then David asked the young man who brought him the news: “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonʹa·than are dead?”","The young man replied: “By chance I was on Mount Gil·boʹa, and there was Saul supporting himself on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen had caught up with him.","When he turned around and saw me, he called me, and I said, ‘Here I am!’","He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I replied, ‘I am an A·malʹek·ite.’","Then he said, ‘Please stand over me and put me to death, for I am in great agony, but I am still alive.’","So I stood over him and put him to death, for I knew that he could not survive after he had fallen down wounded. Then I took the crown  that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I brought them here to my lord.”","At this David took hold of his garments and ripped them apart, and so did all the men who were with him.","And they wailed and wept and fasted until evening for Saul, for his son Jonʹa·than, for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.","David asked the young man who brought him the news: “Where are you from?” He said: “I am the son of a foreign resident, an A·malʹek·ite.”","Then David said to him: “Why did you not fear to lift your hand to do away with the anointed of Jehovah?”","With that David called one of the young men and said: “Step forward and strike him.” So he struck him down, and he died.","David said to him: “Your blood is on your own head, because your own mouth testified against you by saying, ‘I myself put the anointed of Jehovah to death.’”","Then David chanted this dirge  over Saul and his son Jonʹa·than","and said that the people of Judah should be taught the dirge called “The Bow,” which is written in the book of Jaʹshar:","“The beauty, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places.","Do not tell it in Gath;","You mountains of Gil·boʹa,","From the blood of the slain, from the fat of mighty ones,","Saul and Jonʹa·than, beloved and cherished  during their life,","O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,","How the mighty have fallen in battle!","I am distressed over you, my brother Jonʹa·than;","How the mighty have fallen"],["Afterward David inquired of Jehovah, saying: “Should I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” Jehovah said to him: “Go up.” David then asked: “Where should I go?” He replied: “To Hebʹron.”","So David went up there with his two wives, A·hinʹo·am of Jezʹre·el and Abʹi·gail the widow of Naʹbal the Carʹmel·ite.","David also brought the men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the cities around Hebʹron.","Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David as king over the house of Judah.","So David sent messengers to the men of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad and said to them: “May you be blessed by Jehovah, because you showed loyal love to your lord Saul by burying him.","May Jehovah show loyal love and faithfulness to you.

The house of Judah, however, supported David.","The time  that David was king in Hebʹron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.","In time Abʹner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-boʹsheth, Saul’s son, went out from Ma·ha·naʹim to Gibʹe·on.","Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah and the servants of David also went out and encountered them at the pool of Gibʹe·on; and one group sat on this side of the pool, and the other group on that side of the pool.","Finally Abʹner said to Joʹab: “Let the young men get up and engage in combat  before us.” To this Joʹab said: “Let them get up.”","So they got up and crossed over by number, 12 for Benjamin  and Saul’s son Ish-boʹsheth and 12 from the servants of David.","They grabbed one another by the head and each of them thrust his sword into the side of his opponent, and they all fell down together. So that place, which is in Gibʹe·on, was called Helʹkath-haz·zuʹrim.","The fighting that ensued was extremely fierce that day, and Abʹner and the men of Israel were finally defeated before the servants of David.","Now the three sons of Ze·ruʹiah were there—Joʹab, A·bishʹai, and Asʹa·hel; and Asʹa·hel was as swift on his feet as a gazelle in the open field.","Asʹa·hel chased after Abʹner, and he would not veer to the right or to the left in his pursuit of Abʹner.","When Abʹner looked behind, he asked, “Is that you, Asʹa·hel?” to which he replied, “Yes, it is.”","Then Abʹner said to him: “Veer to your right or to your left and capture one of the young men, and take whatever you strip off him for yourself.” But Asʹa·hel did not want to stop chasing him.","So Abʹner said to Asʹa·hel once again: “Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joʹab in the face?”","But he kept refusing to stop, so Abʹner struck him in the abdomen with the butt end of the spear, and the spear came out from his back; and he fell there and died on the spot. Everyone who came to the place where Asʹa·hel fell and died would stop and pause there.","Then Joʹab and A·bishʹai went in pursuit of Abʹner. As the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Amʹmah, which faces Giʹah on the way to the wilderness of Gibʹe·on.","And the Benʹja·min·ites gathered together behind Abʹner, and they formed one company and made a stand on the top of a certain hill.","Then Abʹner called out to Joʹab: “Is the sword going to devour endlessly? Do you not know that the outcome will only be bitterness? How long, then, will it be before you tell the people to turn back from pursuing their brothers?”","At that Joʹab said: “As surely as the true God is living, if you had not spoken, then only by the morning would the people have stopped pursuing their brothers.”","Joʹab now blew the horn, and his men stopped chasing after Israel, and the fighting ceased.","Abʹner and his men then marched through the Arʹa·bah all that night and crossed the Jordan and marched through the entire ravine  and finally came to Ma·ha·naʹim.","After Joʹab turned back from pursuing Abʹner, he gathered all the people together. Of David’s servants, 19 were missing, in addition to Asʹa·hel.","But the servants of David had defeated the Benʹja·min·ites and the men of Abʹner, and 360 of their men had died.","They took Asʹa·hel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which is at Bethʹle·hem. Then Joʹab and his men marched all night long, and they reached Hebʹron at daybreak."],["The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on; and David kept getting stronger, and the house of Saul grew steadily weaker.","Meanwhile, sons were born to David in Hebʹron. His firstborn was Amʹnon by A·hinʹo·am of Jezʹre·el.","His second was Chilʹe·ab by Abʹi·gail, the widow of Naʹbal the Carʹmel·ite; and the third was Abʹsa·lom the son of Maʹa·cah, the daughter of Talʹmai  the king of Geshʹur.","The fourth was Ad·o·niʹjah the son of Hagʹgith, and the fifth was Sheph·a·tiʹah the son of A·biʹtal.","The sixth was Ithʹre·am by David’s wife Egʹlah. These were born to David in Hebʹron.","While the war between the house of Saul and the house of David continued, Abʹner kept strengthening his position in the house of Saul.","Now Saul had had a concubine whose name was Rizʹpah, the daughter of Aʹiah. Ish-boʹsheth later said to Abʹner: “Why did you have relations with the concubine of my father?”","Abʹner grew very angry over the words of Ish-boʹsheth and said: “Am I a dog’s head from Judah? Until this very day, I have shown loyal love toward the house of your father Saul and to his brothers and his friends, and I have not betrayed you into the hand of David; yet today you call me to account for an error concerning a woman.","May God do so to Abʹner and add to it if I do not do for David just as Jehovah swore to him:","to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba.”","He was not able to say one more word in reply to Abʹner, for he was afraid of him.","Abʹner immediately sent messengers to David, saying: “To whom does the land belong?” He added: “Make a covenant with me, and I will do whatever I can  to turn all Israel to your side.”","To this he replied: “Good! I will make a covenant with you. The only thing I ask of you is that you do not try to see my face unless first you bring Miʹchal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.”","Then David sent messengers to Ish-boʹsheth, Saul’s son, saying: “Give me my wife Miʹchal, to whom I became engaged for 100 foreskins of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","So Ish-boʹsheth sent to take her from her husband, Palʹti·el the son of Laʹish.","But her husband kept walking with her, weeping as he followed her as far as Ba·huʹrim. Then Abʹner said to him: “Go, return!” At that he returned.","Meanwhile, Abʹner sent word to the elders of Israel, saying: “For some time you wanted to have David as king over you.","Now act, for Jehovah said to David: ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines and from the hand of all their enemies.’”","Then Abʹner spoke to the people of Benjamin. Abʹner also went to speak privately to David at Hebʹron to tell him what Israel and the whole house of Benjamin had agreed upon.","When Abʹner came to David at Hebʹron with 20 men, David held a feast for Abʹner and for the men with him.","Then Abʹner said to David: “Let me go and gather all Israel together to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you will become king over all that you desire.”  So David sent Abʹner off, and he went his way in peace.","Just then, David’s servants and Joʹab returned from a raid, bringing a great quantity of spoil back with them. Abʹner was no longer with David in Hebʹron, for he had sent him on his way in peace.","When Joʹab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joʹab was told: “Abʹner the son of Ner came to  the king, and he sent him off, and he went his way in peace.”","So Joʹab went in to the king and said: “What have you done? Here Abʹner came to you. Why did you send him off so that he successfully got away?","You know Abʹner the son of Ner! He came here to fool you and to get to know your every move and to find out everything that you are doing.”","So Joʹab left David and sent messengers after Abʹner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Siʹrah; but David did not know anything about it.","When Abʹner returned to Hebʹron, Joʹab took him aside inside the gate to speak with him privately. However, there he stabbed him in the abdomen, and he died; this was for killing  his brother Asʹa·hel.","When David heard about it later, he said: “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before Jehovah of the bloodguilt for Abʹner the son of Ner.","May it turn back on the head of Joʹab and on the entire house of his father. May Joʹab’s house never be without a man suffering from a discharge or a leper or a man working at the spindle  or one falling by the sword or one in need of food!”","So Joʹab and his brother A·bishʹai killed Abʹner because he had put Asʹa·hel their brother to death in the battle at Gibʹe·on.","Then David said to Joʹab and all the people with him: “Rip your garments apart and tie on sackcloth and wail over Abʹner.” King David himself was walking behind the funeral bier.","They buried Abʹner in Hebʹron; and the king wept loudly at Abʹner’s tomb, and all the people gave way to weeping.","The king chanted over Abʹner and said:","Your hands had not been bound,","Later all the people came to give David bread for consolation  while it was still daytime, but David swore: “May God do so to me and add to it if before the sun sets I taste bread or anything at all!”","All the people took notice, and it pleased them. Like everything that the king did, it pleased all the people.","So all the people and all Israel knew on that day that the king was not responsible for having Abʹner the son of Ner put to death.","Then the king said to his servants: “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?","Today I am weak, although anointed as king, and these men, the sons of Ze·ruʹiah, are too brutal for me. May Jehovah repay the evildoer according to his own evil.”"],["When Saul’s son Ish-boʹsheth  heard that Abʹner had died in Hebʹron, his courage failed him  and all the Israelites were disturbed.","There were two men in charge of the marauder bands that belonged to the son of Saul: one was named Baʹa·nah and the other Reʹchab. They were sons of Rimʹmon the Be·erʹoth·ite, of the tribe of Benjamin. (For Be·erʹoth too used  to be counted as part of Benjamin.","The Be·erʹoth·ites ran away to Gitʹta·im, and they are foreign residents there down to this day.)","Now Saul’s son Jonʹa·than had a son whose feet were crippled.  He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonʹa·than came from Jezʹre·el, and his nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was fleeing in panic, he fell and was crippled. His name was Me·phibʹo·sheth.","The sons of Rimʹmon the Be·erʹoth·ite, Reʹchab and Baʹa·nah, went to the house of Ish-boʹsheth during the hot part of the day, as he was taking his midday rest.","They went into the house as if they were getting wheat, and they struck him in the abdomen; then Reʹchab and his brother Baʹa·nah escaped.","When they had entered the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, and they struck him and put him to death, after which they cut off his head. Then they took his head and walked all night long on the road to the Arʹa·bah.","And they brought the head of Ish-boʹsheth to David at Hebʹron and said to the king: “Here is the head of Ish-boʹsheth the son of Saul your enemy who sought your life.  This day Jehovah gives to my lord the king revenge on Saul and his descendants.”","However, David answered Reʹchab and his brother Baʹa·nah, the sons of Rimʹmon the Be·erʹoth·ite, and said to them: “As surely as Jehovah is living, the one who rescued me  out of all distress,","when someone reported to me, ‘Here Saul is dead,’ and he thought he was bringing me good news, I took hold of him and killed him in Zikʹlag. That was the messenger’s reward he received from me!","How much more so when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed! Should I not require his blood from your hands and rid the earth of you?”","David then ordered the young men to kill them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung them by the pool in Hebʹron. But they took the head of Ish-boʹsheth and buried it in the burial place of Abʹner in Hebʹron."],["In time all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebʹron and said: “Look! We are your own bone and flesh.","In times past while Saul was our king, you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns.  And Jehovah said to you: ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become leader over Israel.’”","So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebʹron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebʹron before Jehovah. Then they anointed David as king over Israel.","David was 30 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 40 years.","In Hebʹron he reigned over Judah for 7 years and 6 months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years over all Israel and Judah.","And the king and his men set out for Jerusalem against the Jebʹu·sites who were inhabiting the land. They taunted David: “You will never come in here! Even the blind and the lame will drive you away.” They thought, ‘David will never get in here.’","However, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the City of David.","So David  said on that day: “Those who attack the Jebʹu·sites should go through the water tunnel to strike down both ‘the lame and the blind,’ who are hateful to David!”  That is why it is said: “The blind and the lame will never enter the house.”","Then David took up residence in the stronghold, and it was called  the City of David; and David began to build all around from the Mound  inward.","Thus David became greater and greater, and Jehovah the God of armies was with him.","King Hiʹram of Tyre sent messengers to David, also cedar timbers, woodworkers, and stonemasons for building walls, and they began to build a house  for David.","And David knew that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.","David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem after he came from Hebʹron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.","These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Sham·muʹa, Shoʹbab, Nathan, Solʹo·mon,","Ibʹhar, E·liʹshu·a, Neʹpheg, Ja·phiʹa,","E·lishʹa·ma, E·liʹa·da, and E·liphʹe·let.","When the Phi·lisʹtines heard that David had been anointed as king over Israel, all the Phi·lisʹtines came up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the stronghold.","Then the Phi·lisʹtines came in and spread out in the Valley  of Rephʹa·im.","David inquired of Jehovah, saying: “Should I go up against the Phi·lisʹtines? Will you give them into my hand?” At this Jehovah said to David: “Go up, for I will surely give the Phi·lisʹtines into your hand.”","So David came to Baʹal-pe·raʹzim, and David struck them down there. At that he said: “Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me, like a breach made by waters.” That is why he named that place Baʹal-pe·raʹzim.","The Phi·lisʹtines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men took them away.","Later the Phi·lisʹtines came up once again and spread out in the Valley  of Rephʹa·im.","David inquired of Jehovah, but He said: “Do not go directly up. Instead, go around behind them, and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes.","And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes, then act decisively, for Jehovah will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Phi·lisʹtines.”","So David did just as Jehovah commanded him, and he struck down the Phi·lisʹtines from Geʹba all the way to Geʹzer."],["David again gathered all the best troops in Israel, 30,000 men.","Then David and all the men with him set out for Baʹal·e-juʹdah to bring up from there the Ark of the true God, before which people call on the name of Jehovah of armies, who sits enthroned above  the cherubs.","However, they placed the Ark of the true God on a new wagon to transport it from the house of A·binʹa·dab, which was on the hill; and Uzʹzah and A·hiʹo, the sons of A·binʹa·dab, were leading the new wagon.","So they transported the Ark of the true God from A·binʹa·dab’s  house on the hill, and A·hiʹo was walking ahead of the Ark.","David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before Jehovah with all sorts of juniper-wood instruments, harps, other stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.","But when they came to the threshing floor of Naʹcon, Uzʹzah thrust his hand out to the Ark of the true God and grabbed hold of it, for the cattle nearly upset it.","At that Jehovah’s anger blazed against Uzʹzah, and the true God struck him down there for his irreverent act, and he died there beside the Ark of the true God.","But David became angry  because Jehovah’s wrath had broken through against Uzʹzah; and that place has been called Peʹrez-uzʹzah  down to this day.","So David became fearful of Jehovah on that day and said: “How can the Ark of Jehovah come to me?”","David was not willing to bring the Ark of Jehovah to where he was in the City of David. Instead, David had it taken to the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom the Gitʹtite.","The Ark of Jehovah remained at the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom the Gitʹtite for three months, and Jehovah kept blessing Oʹbed-eʹdom and all his household.","The report was made to King David: “Jehovah has blessed the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom and all that belongs to him because of the Ark of the true God.” So David went to bring the Ark of the true God from the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom up to the City of David with rejoicing.","When the carriers of the Ark of Jehovah had marched six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened animal.","David was dancing around before Jehovah with all his might; all the while David wore  a linen ephʹod.","David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the Ark of Jehovah with joyful shouting and with the sound of the horn.","But when the Ark of Jehovah came into the City of David, Saul’s daughter Miʹchal looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing around before Jehovah; and she began to despise him in her heart.","So they brought the Ark of Jehovah in and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before Jehovah.","When David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of armies.","Further, he distributed to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, to each man and woman, a ring-shaped loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake, and then all the people left, each to his own house.","When David returned to bless his own household, Saul’s daughter Miʹchal came out to meet him. She said: “How glorious the king of Israel made himself when he uncovered himself today before the eyes of the slave girls of his servants, just as an empty-headed man openly uncovers himself!”","At this David said to Miʹchal: “My celebration was before Jehovah, who chose me rather than your father and all his household and who appointed me as leader over Jehovah’s people, Israel.

And the Moʹab·ites became David’s servants and brought tribute.","David defeated Had·ad·eʹzer the son of Reʹhob the king of Zoʹbah as he was on his way to restore his authority at the Eu·phraʹtes River.","David captured 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. Then David hamstrung all but 100 of the chariot horses.","When the Syrians of Damascus came to help King Had·ad·eʹzer of Zoʹbah, David struck down 22,000 of the Syrians.","David then established garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became David’s servants and brought tribute. Jehovah gave David victory  wherever he went.","Moreover, David took the circular shields of gold from the servants of Had·ad·eʹzer and brought them to Jerusalem.","From Beʹtah and Be·roʹthai, cities of Had·ad·eʹzer, King David took a great quantity of copper.","Now King Toʹi of Haʹmath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Had·ad·eʹzer.","So Toʹi sent his son Joʹram to King David to ask about his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought  and defeated Had·ad·eʹzer (for Had·ad·eʹzer had often fought against Toʹi), and he brought articles of silver, gold, and copper.","King David sanctified these to Jehovah, along with the silver and the gold that he had sanctified from all the nations that he had subdued:","from Syria and Moʹab, from the Amʹmon·ites, the Phi·lisʹtines, the A·malʹek·ites, and from the spoil of Had·ad·eʹzer the son of Reʹhob the king of Zoʹbah.","David also made a name for himself when he came back from striking down 18,000 Eʹdom·ites in the Valley of Salt.","He established garrisons in Eʹdom. In all Eʹdom he established garrisons, and all the Eʹdom·ites became David’s servants. Jehovah gave David victory  wherever he went.","David kept reigning over all Israel, and David was administering justice and righteousness for all his people.","Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah was over the army, and Je·hoshʹa·phat the son of A·hiʹlud was recorder.","Zaʹdok the son of A·hiʹtub and A·himʹe·lech the son of A·biʹa·thar were priests, and Se·raiʹah was secretary.","Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da was over the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites. And David’s sons became chief ministers."],["David then said: “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I may show loyal love for the sake of Jonʹa·than?”","Now there was a servant of the house of Saul named Ziʹba. So they called him to David, and the king asked him: “Are you Ziʹba?” He replied: “I am your servant.”","The king continued: “Is there anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may extend God’s loyal love?” Ziʹba replied to the king: “There is still one son of Jonʹa·than; he is crippled  in both feet.”","The king asked him: “Where is he?” Ziʹba replied to the king: “He is in the house of Maʹchir the son of Amʹmi·el at Lo-deʹbar.”","King David immediately sent for him and took him from the house of Maʹchir the son of Amʹmi·el at Lo-deʹbar.","When Me·phibʹo·sheth the son of Jonʹa·than the son of Saul came in to David, he at once fell facedown and prostrated himself.

But Me·phibʹo·sheth, the grandson of your master, will always dine at my table.”","Then Ziʹba said to the king: “Your servant will do all that my lord the king commands his servant to do.” So Me·phibʹo·sheth ate at David’s  table like one of the sons of the king.","Now Me·phibʹo·sheth also had a young son named Miʹca; and all those who lived in Ziʹba’s house became servants of Me·phibʹo·sheth.","And Me·phibʹo·sheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the table of the king; and he was crippled in both feet."],["Later the king of the Amʹmon·ites died, and his son Haʹnun became king in his place.","At that David said: “I will show loyal love toward Haʹnun the son of Naʹhash as his father showed loyal love toward me.” So David sent his servants to offer him comfort over the loss of his father. But when David’s servants came into the land of the Amʹmon·ites,","the princes of the Amʹmon·ites said to Haʹnun their lord: “Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you? Is it not to search through the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it that David has sent his servants to you?”","So Haʹnun took the servants of David and shaved off half their beards and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away.","When David was told, he at once sent men to meet them, because the men had been deeply humiliated; and the king told them: “Stay in Jerʹi·cho until your beards grow back, and then return.”","In time the Amʹmon·ites saw that they had become a stench to David, so the Amʹmon·ites sent and hired Syrians of Beth-reʹhob and Syrians of Zoʹbah, 20,000 foot soldiers; and the king of Maʹa·cah, with 1,000 men; and from Ishʹtob,  12,000 men.","When David heard about it, he sent Joʹab and the entire army, including his mightiest warriors.","And the Amʹmon·ites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city gate while the Syrians of Zoʹbah and of Reʹhob, along with Ishʹtob  and Maʹa·cah, were by themselves in the open field.","When Joʹab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear, he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians.","He put the rest of the men under the command  of his brother A·bishʹai, in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Amʹmon·ites.","Then he said: “If the Syrians become too strong for me, then you must come to my rescue; but if the Amʹmon·ites become too strong for you, I will come to your rescue.","We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes.”","Then Joʹab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle, and they fled from before him.","When the Amʹmon·ites saw that the Syrians had fled, they fled from A·bishʹai and went into the city. After that Joʹab returned from the Amʹmon·ites and came to Jerusalem.","When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped.","So Had·ad·eʹzer sent for the Syrians in the region of the River,  and then they came to Heʹlam, with Shoʹbach the chief of the army of Had·ad·eʹzer leading them.","When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to Heʹlam. The  Syrians then drew up in battle formation to meet David and fought against him.","But the Syrians fled from Israel; and David killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 horsemen of the Syrians, and he struck down Shoʹbach the chief of their army, who died there.","When all the kings, the servants of Had·ad·eʹzer, saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they promptly made peace with Israel and became their subjects; and the Syrians were afraid to help the Amʹmon·ites anymore."],["At the start of the year,  at the time when kings go on campaigns, David sent Joʹab and his servants and the entire army of Israel to bring the Amʹmon·ites to ruin, and they besieged Rabʹbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem.","One evening  David got up from his bed and walked around on the rooftop of the king’s house.  From the rooftop he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful.","David sent someone to inquire about the woman, and he reported: “Is this not Bath-sheʹba the daughter of E·liʹam and the wife of U·riʹah the Hitʹtite?”","Then David sent messengers to bring her. So she came in to him, and he lay down with her. (This happened while she was purifying herself from her uncleanness. ) Afterward, she returned to her house.","The woman became pregnant, and she sent a message to David: “I am pregnant.”","At this David sent a message to Joʹab: “Send to me U·riʹah the Hitʹtite.” So Joʹab sent U·riʹah to David.","When U·riʹah came to him, David asked him how Joʹab was getting along, how the troops were getting along, and how the war was going.","David then said to U·riʹah: “Go down to your house and relax.”  When U·riʹah left the king’s house, the king’s courtesy gift  was sent after him.","However, U·riʹah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the other servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his own house.","So David was told: “U·riʹah did not go down to his own house.” At that David said to U·riʹah: “Have you not just returned from a journey? Why did you not go down to your own house?”","U·riʹah replied to David: “The Ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in temporary shelters, and my lord Joʹab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. So should I go into my own house to eat and drink and lie down with my wife? As surely as you live and are alive,  I will not do this thing!”","Then David said to U·riʹah: “Stay here also today, and tomorrow I will send you away.” So U·riʹah stayed in Jerusalem on that day and the following day.","David then sent for him to come and eat and drink with him, and he got him drunk. But in the evening, he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his house.","In the morning David wrote a letter to Joʹab and sent it by the hand of U·riʹah.","He wrote in the letter: “Put U·riʹah in the front lines where the fighting is fiercest. Then retreat from behind him, so that he will be struck down and die.”","Joʹab had been carefully watching the city, and he stationed U·riʹah where he knew there were mighty warriors.","When the men of the city came out and fought against Joʹab, some of David’s servants fell, and U·riʹah the Hitʹtite was among those who died.","Joʹab now reported to David all the news about the war.","He instructed the messenger: “When you finish speaking to the king about all the news of the war,","the king may become angry and say to you, ‘Why did you have to go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the top of the wall?","Who struck down A·bimʹe·lech the son of Je·rubʹbe·sheth? Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the top of the wall, causing his death at Theʹbez? Why did you have to go so close to the wall?’ Then say, ‘Your servant U·riʹah the Hitʹtite also died.’”","So the messenger went and told David everything that Joʹab had sent him to tell.","Then the messenger told David: “Their men overpowered us, and they came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate.","And the archers were shooting at your servants from the top of the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant U·riʹah the Hitʹtite also died.”","At that David said to the messenger: “Say this to Joʹab: ‘Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Intensify your battle against the city and conquer it.’ And encourage him.”","When U·riʹah’s wife heard that her husband U·riʹah had died, she began to mourn her husband.","As soon as the mourning period was over, David sent for her and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done was very displeasing to  Jehovah."],["So Jehovah sent Nathan to David. He came in to him and said: “There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor.","The rich man had very many sheep and cattle;","but the poor man had nothing but one small female lamb, which he had bought. He cared for it, and it grew up together with him and his sons. It would eat from the little food he had and drink from his cup and sleep in his arms. It became as a daughter to him.","Later a visitor came to the rich man, but he would not take any of his own sheep and cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”","At this David grew very angry against the man, and he said to Nathan: “As surely as Jehovah is living, the man who did this deserves to die!","And he should pay for the lamb four times over, because he did this and showed no compassion.”","Then Nathan said to David: “You are the man! This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘I myself anointed you as king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.","I was willing to give you your master’s house and put your master’s wives in your arms, and I gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And as if that were not enough, I was willing to do much more for you.","Why did you despise the word of Jehovah by doing what is bad in  his eyes? You struck down U·riʹah the Hitʹtite with the sword! Then you took his wife as your wife after you killed him by the sword of the Amʹmon·ites.","Now a sword will never depart from your own house, because you despised me by taking the wife of U·riʹah the Hitʹtite as your wife.’","This is what Jehovah says: ‘Here I am bringing against you calamity from within your own house; and before your own eyes, I will take your wives and give them to another man,  and he will lie down with your wives in broad daylight.","Although you acted in secret, I will do this in front of all Israel and in broad daylight.’”","David then said to Nathan: “I have sinned against Jehovah.” Nathan replied to David: “Jehovah, in turn, forgives your sin.  You will not die.","Nevertheless, because you have treated Jehovah with utter disrespect in this matter, the son just born to you will certainly die.”","Then Nathan went to his own house.","David pleaded with the true God in behalf of the boy. David went on a strict fast and would go in and spend the night lying on the ground.","So the elders of his house stood over him and tried to raise him up from the ground, but he refused and would not eat with them.","On the seventh day the child died, but David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They said: “While the child was alive we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. So how can we tell him that the child has died? He may do something terrible.”","When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he discerned that the child had died. David said to his servants: “Has the child died?” They replied: “He has died.”","So David got up from the ground. He washed, rubbed himself with oil, changed his clothing, and went to the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself. Afterward, he went to his house  and asked for food to be brought to him, and he ate.","His servants asked him: “Why have you acted in this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and kept weeping; but as soon as the child died, you got up and ate food.”","He replied: “While the child was alive, I fasted and kept weeping because I said to myself, ‘Who knows whether Jehovah may show me favor and let the child live?’","Now that he has died, why should I fast? Can I bring him back? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”","Then David comforted his wife Bath-sheʹba. He went in to her and lay down with her. In time she bore a son, and he was named Solʹo·mon.  And Jehovah loved him,","and he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jed·i·diʹah,  for the sake of Jehovah.","Joʹab continued fighting against Rabʹbah of the Amʹmon·ites, and he captured the royal city.","So Joʹab sent messengers to David and said: “I have fought against Rabʹbah, and I have captured the city  of waters.","Now gather the rest of the troops and encamp against the city and capture it. Otherwise, I will be the one to capture the city, and it will be credited to me.”","So David gathered all the troops and went to Rabʹbah and fought against it and captured it.","Then he took the crown of Malʹcam from its head. The weight of it was a talent  of gold, along with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. He also took a vast amount of spoil from the city.","And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones, at working with sharp iron instruments and with iron axes, and at brickmaking. That was what he did to all the cities of the Amʹmon·ites. Finally David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem."],["Now David’s son Abʹsa·lom had a beautiful sister named Taʹmar, and David’s son Amʹnon fell in love with her.","Amʹnon was so distressed that he became sick because of his sister Taʹmar, for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for Amʹnon to do anything to her.","Now Amʹnon had a companion named Je·honʹa·dab, the son of Shimʹe·ah, David’s brother; and Je·honʹa·dab was a very clever man.","So he said to him: “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed every morning? Why not tell me?” Amʹnon replied to him: “I am in love with Taʹmar, the sister of my brother Abʹsa·lom.”","Je·honʹa·dab replied to him: “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please, let my sister Taʹmar come and serve me some food. If she prepares the food given to the sick  before my eyes, I will eat it from her hand.’”","So Amʹnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and the king came in to see him. Then Amʹnon said to the king: “Please, let my sister Taʹmar come in and bake two heart-shaped cakes before my eyes so that I may take food from her hand.”","At that David sent a message to Taʹmar at the house, saying: “Please go to the house of your brother Amʹnon and prepare food  for him.”","So Taʹmar went to the house of her brother Amʹnon, where he was lying down. She took the dough and kneaded it into cakes before his eyes and cooked the cakes.","Then she took the pan and served him. But Amʹnon refused to eat and said: “Have everybody leave me!” So everybody left him.","Amʹnon now said to Taʹmar: “Bring the food  into the bedroom, so that I may eat it from your hand.” So Taʹmar took the heart-shaped cakes that she had made and brought them to her brother Amʹnon in the bedroom.","When she brought them for him to eat, he grabbed her and said: “Come, lie down with me, my sister.”","But she said to him: “No, my brother! Do not humiliate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing.","How could I live down my shame? And you will be regarded as one of the disgraceful men in Israel. Now speak, please, to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”","But he refused to listen to her, and he overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her.","Then  Amʹnon began hating her with a very intense hatred, so that his hatred for her became greater than the love he had felt for her. Amʹnon said to her: “Get up; go away!”","At this she said to him: “No, my brother, for sending me away now is worse than what you have done with me!” But he refused to listen to her.","With that he called his young attendant and said: “Get this person out of my presence, please, and lock the door behind her.”","(Now she was wearing a special  robe, for those were the garments that the virgin daughters of the king wore.) So his attendant led her outside, and he locked the door behind her.","Then Taʹmar put ashes on her head, and she ripped apart the fine robe she was wearing; and she kept her hands on her head and walked off, crying out as she walked.","At this her brother Abʹsa·lom asked her: “Was it your brother Amʹnon who was with you? And now keep silent, my sister. He is your brother. Do not let your heart dwell on this matter.” Then Taʹmar lived in isolation at the house of her brother Abʹsa·lom.","When King David heard about all these things, he became very angry. But he would not hurt the feelings of Amʹnon his son, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn.","And Abʹsa·lom said nothing to Amʹnon, either bad or good; for Abʹsa·lom hated Amʹnon because he had humiliated his sister Taʹmar.","After two full years, Abʹsa·lom’s sheepshearers were at Baʹal-haʹzor, near Eʹphra·im, and Abʹsa·lom invited all the sons of the king.","So Abʹsa·lom came in to the king and said: “Your servant is having his sheep sheared. Please let the king and his servants go with me.”","But the king said to Abʹsa·lom: “No, my son. If all of us go, we will be a burden to you.” Although he kept urging him, he did not consent to go, but he blessed him.","Abʹsa·lom then said: “If not you, please let my brother Amʹnon go with us.” The king replied to him: “Why should he go with you?”","But Abʹsa·lom urged him, so he sent Amʹnon and all the king’s sons with him.","Then Abʹsa·lom ordered his attendants: “Watch, and when Amʹnon’s heart is in a cheerful mood from the wine, I will say to you, ‘Strike down Amʹnon!’ You must then put him to death. Do not be afraid. Is it not I who command you? Be strong and courageous.”","So Abʹsa·lom’s attendants did to Amʹnon exactly as Abʹsa·lom had ordered; then all the other sons of the king got up, and each one mounted his mule and fled.","While they were on the way, the report reached David: “Abʹsa·lom has struck down all the sons of the king, and not one of them survived.”","At this the king got up and ripped his clothes apart and lay on the ground, and all his servants were standing by with their garments ripped apart.","However, Je·honʹa·dab the son of Shimʹe·ah, David’s brother, said: “Do not let my lord think that they have killed all the young sons of the king, for only Amʹnon has died. This is by the order of Abʹsa·lom, who decided to do this from the day that Amʹnon humiliated his sister Taʹmar.","Now do not let my lord the king pay attention to  the report that says, ‘All the king’s sons have died’; only Amʹnon has died.”","Meanwhile, Abʹsa·lom ran away. Later the watchman raised his eyes and saw that there were many people coming from the road behind him next to the mountain.","At this Je·honʹa·dab said to the king: “Look! The king’s sons have returned. It is just as your servant said.”","As he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, weeping loudly; also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.","But Abʹsa·lom fled and went to Talʹmai the son of Am·miʹhud the king of Geshʹur. David mourned his son for many days.","After Abʹsa·lom fled and went to Geshʹur, he stayed there for three years.","Finally King David longed to go to Abʹsa·lom, for he had become reconciled to  the death of Amʹnon."],["Now Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah learned that the king’s heart longed for Abʹsa·lom.","So Joʹab sent to Te·koʹa and summoned from there a clever woman and told her: “Act like you are in mourning, please, and put on garments of mourning, and do not rub yourself with oil. Behave like a woman who has been mourning over someone dead for a long time.","Then go in and speak to the king like this.” With that Joʹab put the words in her mouth.","The Te·koʹite woman went in to the king and fell with her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said: “Help me, O king!”","The king replied to her: “What is the matter?” To this she said: “Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.","And I, your servant, had two sons, and the two of them fought with each other in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other down and killed him.","Now the whole family has risen up against me, your servant, and they are saying, ‘Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death for the life  of his brother whom he killed, even if it means wiping out the heir!’ They would extinguish the last glowing coal that I have left  and leave to my husband neither a name nor a survivor  on the surface of the earth.”","Then the king said to the woman: “Go to your home, and I will issue an order regarding you.”","At this the Te·koʹite woman said to the king: “O my lord the king, let the guilt be on me and on my father’s house, while the king and his throne are innocent.”","The king then said: “If anyone speaks further to you, bring him to me, and he will never trouble you again.”","But she said: “Please, let the king remember Jehovah your God, so that the avenger of blood does not bring ruin and annihilate my son.” To this he said: “As surely as Jehovah is living, not one of your son’s hairs will fall to the ground.”","The woman now said: “Let your servant, please, speak a word to my lord the king.” So he said: “Speak!”","The woman said: “Why, then, have you thought to do something like this against the people of God? When the king speaks this way, he makes himself guilty, for the king does not bring back his own banished son.","We will surely die and be like waters that are poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. But God would not take away a life,  and he considers reasons  why the banished one should not always be banished from him.","I have come in to say this to my lord the king because the people made me afraid. So your servant said, ‘Let me speak, please, to the king. Perhaps the king will act on the request of his slave.","The king may listen and rescue his slave from the hand of the man seeking to annihilate me and my only son from the inheritance God gave us.’","Then your servant said, ‘May the word of my lord the king please give me relief,’ for my lord the king is just like an angel of the true God in distinguishing what is good from what is bad. May Jehovah your God be with you.”","The king now answered the woman: “Please do not hide from me anything I ask you.” The woman replied: “Let my lord the king speak, please.”","The king then asked: “Did Joʹab put you up to all of this?” The woman answered: “As surely as you are  living, O my lord the king, it is just as  my lord the king says, for it was your servant Joʹab who instructed me and put all these words in the mouth of your servant.","Your servant Joʹab has done this to change the appearance of things, but my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of the true God and knows all that is happening in the land.”","The king then said to Joʹab: “All right, I will do this thing. Go and bring back the young man Abʹsa·lom.”","At this Joʹab fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and praised the king. Joʹab said: “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, O my lord the king, because the king has acted on the request of his servant.”","Then Joʹab got up and went to Geshʹur and brought Abʹsa·lom to Jerusalem.","However, the king said: “Let him return to his own house, but he may not see my face.” So Abʹsa·lom returned to his own house, and he did not see the face of the king.","Now in all Israel, no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance as Abʹsa·lom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no flaw in him.","When he shaved his head—he had to shave it at the end of every year because it was so heavy for him—the hair of his head weighed 200 shekels  by the royal stone weight.","To Abʹsa·lom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Taʹmar. She was a very beautiful woman.","And Abʹsa·lom continued living in Jerusalem for two full years, but he did not see the face of the king.","So Abʹsa·lom summoned Joʹab in order to send him to the king, but Joʹab would not come to him. Then he sent for him again, a second time, and he still refused to come.","Finally he said to his servants: “Joʹab’s plot of land is next to mine, and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So the servants of Abʹsa·lom set the plot of land on fire.","At this Joʹab got up and came to Abʹsa·lom’s house and said to him: “Why did your servants set my plot of land on fire?”","Abʹsa·lom replied to Joʹab: “Look! I sent this message to you, ‘Come and let me send you to the king to ask: “Why have I come from Geshʹur? It  would have been better for me to stay there. Now let me see the face of the king, and if there is guilt in me, then he should put me to death.”’”","So Joʹab went in to the king and told him. Then he called Abʹsa·lom, who came in to the king and prostrated himself before him, falling with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Abʹsa·lom."],["After all these things, Abʹsa·lom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him.","Abʹsa·lom would rise up early and stand at the side of the road to the city gate. Whenever any man had a legal case that was to come to the king for judgment, Abʹsa·lom would call him and say: “From what city are you?” and he would say: “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”","Abʹsa·lom would say to him: “See, your claims are right and proper, but there is no one from the king to hear your case.”","Abʹsa·lom would say: “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then every man who has a legal case or judgment could come to me, and I would see that he receives justice.”","And when a man came near to bow down to him, Abʹsa·lom would extend his hand and grab hold of him and kiss him.","Abʹsa·lom would do this to all the Israelites who would come in to the king for judgment; so Abʹsa·lom kept stealing the hearts of the men of Israel.","At the end of four years,  Abʹsa·lom said to the king: “Let me go, please, to Hebʹron to pay my vow that I made to Jehovah.","For your servant made this solemn vow when I was dwelling in Geshʹur in Syria: ‘If Jehovah will bring me back to Jerusalem, I will make an offering to  Jehovah.’”","So the king said to him: “Go in peace.” With that he rose up and went to Hebʹron.","Abʹsa·lom now sent spies through all the tribes of Israel, saying: “As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, announce, ‘Abʹsa·lom has become king in Hebʹron!’”","Now 200 men from Jerusalem had gone there with Abʹsa·lom; they were invited and went unsuspectingly, unaware of what was happening.","Further, when he offered the sacrifices, Abʹsa·lom sent for A·hithʹo·phel the Giʹlon·ite, David’s adviser,  from his city Giʹloh. The conspiracy kept gaining momentum, and the people who supported Abʹsa·lom were growing in number.","In time an informer came to David, saying: “The heart of the men of Israel has turned to Abʹsa·lom.”","At once David said to all his servants with him in Jerusalem: “Get up, and let us run away, for none of us will escape from Abʹsa·lom! Hurry, for fear he may quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the sword!”","The king’s servants replied to the king: “Whatever my lord the king decides, your servants are ready to do.”","So the king went out with all his household following him, but the king left ten concubines to take care of the house.","And the king continued on his way out with all the people following, and they stopped at Beth-merʹhak.","All his servants leaving with him  and all the Cherʹe·thites, the Pelʹe·thites, and the Gitʹtites, 600 men who had followed him from Gath, were  passing by as the king reviewed them.","Then the king said to Itʹtai the Gitʹtite: “Why should you also go with us? Go back and dwell with the new king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your place.","Yesterday you came, so today should I make you wander with us, to go when I must go and where I must go? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may Jehovah show you loyal love and faithfulness!”","But Itʹtai answered the king: “As surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as my lord the king is living, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there your servant will be!”","At that David said to Itʹtai: “Go and cross over.” So Itʹtai the Gitʹtite crossed over, together with all his men and children.","Everyone in the land was weeping loudly while all these people crossed over, and the king was standing by the Kidʹron Valley; all the people were crossing over to the road leading to the wilderness.","Zaʹdok was also there and with him were all the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of the true God; and they set the Ark of the true God down; and A·biʹa·thar went up, while all the people completed crossing over from the city.","But the king said to Zaʹdok: “Take the Ark of the true God back to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will also bring me back and let me see it and its dwelling place.","But if he should say, ‘I have found no pleasure in you,’ then let him do to me whatever seems good in his eyes.”","The king said to Zaʹdok the priest: “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and take the two sons of you men with you, A·himʹa·az your own son and Jonʹa·than the son of A·biʹa·thar.","See, I will linger by the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”","So Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar took the Ark of the true God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.","As David was going up the Mount  of Olives, he was weeping as he went up; his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. All the people with him also covered their heads and were weeping as they went up.","David was then told: “A·hithʹo·phel is among those conspiring with Abʹsa·lom.” At this David said: “Turn, please, the advice  of A·hithʹo·phel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”","When David came to the summit where people used to bow down to God, Huʹshai the Arʹchite was there to meet him, with his robe ripped apart and dirt on his head.","However, David said to him: “If you go across with me, you will be a load on me.","But if you return to the city and you say to Abʹsa·lom, ‘I am your servant, O King. I was the servant of your father in the past, but now I am your servant,’ you can then frustrate the advice of A·hithʹo·phel for me.","Are not Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar the priests there with you? You must tell Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar the priests everything that you hear from the house of the king.","Look! There with them are their two sons, A·himʹa·az the son of Zaʹdok and Jonʹa·than the son of A·biʹa·thar, and through them send to me everything that you hear.”","So Huʹshai, David’s friend,  went into the city as Abʹsa·lom was entering into Jerusalem."],["When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziʹba, the attendant of Me·phibʹo·sheth, was there to meet him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them were 200 loaves of bread, 100 cakes of raisins, 100 cakes of summer fruit,  and a large jar of wine.","Then the king said to Ziʹba: “Why have you brought these things?” Ziʹba replied: “The donkeys are for the household of the king to ride, the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the wilderness to drink.”","The king now said: “And where is the son  of your master?” At this Ziʹba said to the king: “He is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give back the royal rule of my father to me.’”","The king then said to Ziʹba: “Look! Everything that belongs to Me·phibʹo·sheth is yours.” Ziʹba replied: “I bow down before you. May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”","When King David reached Ba·huʹrim, a man of the family of Saul’s house named Shimʹe·i, the son of Geʹra, came out shouting curses as he approached.","He was throwing stones at David and at all the servants of King David, as well as at all the people and the mighty men on his right and on his left.","Shimʹe·i said as he cursed: “Get out, get out, you bloodguilty man! You worthless man!","Jehovah has brought back on you all the bloodguilt for the house of Saul, in whose place you have ruled as king, but Jehovah gives the kingship into the hand of Abʹsa·lom your son. Now calamity has overtaken you because you are a bloodguilty man!”","Then A·bishʹai the son of Ze·ruʹiah said to the king: “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, please, and take off his head.”","But the king said: “What do I have to do with you, you sons of Ze·ruʹiah? Let him curse me, for Jehovah has said to him, ‘Curse David!’ So who should say, ‘Why are you doing this?’”","David then said to A·bishʹai and all his servants: “Here my own son, who came from my own body, is seeking my life,  and how much more now a Benʹja·min·ite! Leave him alone so that he may curse me, for Jehovah told him to!","Perhaps Jehovah will see my affliction, and Jehovah will restore goodness to me instead of the curses shouted at me this day.”","With that David and his men kept going down the road while Shimʹe·i was walking alongside the mountain abreast of him, shouting curses and throwing stones and a lot of dust.","At length the king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted, and they refreshed themselves.","Meanwhile, Abʹsa·lom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, and A·hithʹo·phel was with him.","When Huʹshai the Arʹchite, David’s friend,  came in to Abʹsa·lom, Huʹshai said to Abʹsa·lom: “Long live the king! Long live the king!”","At this Abʹsa·lom said to Huʹshai: “Is this your loyal love toward your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”","So Huʹshai said to Abʹsa·lom: “No, I am on the side of the one who has been chosen by Jehovah, this people, and all the men of Israel. I will stay with him.","And again I say, Whom  should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.”","Abʹsa·lom then said to A·hithʹo·phel: “Give me your advice.  What should we do?”","At that A·hithʹo·phel said to Abʹsa·lom: “Have relations with your father’s concubines, those whom he left behind to take care of the house.  Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and those who support you will be strengthened.”","So they pitched a tent for Abʹsa·lom on the roof, and Abʹsa·lom had relations with the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel.","In those days the advice that A·hithʹo·phel gave was considered as  the word of the true God. That was how all the advice of A·hithʹo·phel was esteemed, both by David and by Abʹsa·lom."],["A·hithʹo·phel then said to Abʹsa·lom: “Please let me choose 12,000 men and rise up and chase after David tonight.","I will come upon him when he is weary and powerless,  and I will throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike down only the king.","Then I will bring all the people back to you. The return of all the people depends on what happens with the man you are seeking. Then all the people will be at peace.”","The proposal was just right in the eyes of Abʹsa·lom and all the elders of Israel.","However, Abʹsa·lom said: “Please call Huʹshai the Arʹchite as well, and let us hear what he has to say.”","So Huʹshai came in to Abʹsa·lom. Then Abʹsa·lom said to him: “This is the advice A·hithʹo·phel gave. Should we act on his advice? If not, you tell us.”","At this Huʹshai said to Abʹsa·lom: “The advice that A·hithʹo·phel gave is not good in this instance!”","Huʹshai continued: “You well know that your father and his men are mighty, and they are desperate,  like a bear that has lost her cubs in the field. Moreover, your father is a warrior, and he will not spend the night with the people.","At this very moment he is hiding in one of the caves  or in some other place; and if he attacks first, those hearing of it will say, ‘The people following Abʹsa·lom have been defeated!’","Even the courageous man whose heart is like that of a lion will surely melt in fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that the men with him are courageous.","I give this advice: Let all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba, as many as the grains of sand by the sea, and you should lead them into the fight.","We will come against him wherever he is found, and we will come upon him just like the dew that falls on the ground; and not one of them will survive, not he nor any of the men with him.","If he retreats into a city, all Israel will carry ropes to that city, and we will drag it down into the valley until not even a pebble is left.”","Then Abʹsa·lom and all the men of Israel said: “The advice of Huʹshai the Arʹchite is better than the advice of A·hithʹo·phel!” For Jehovah had determined  to frustrate the sound advice of A·hithʹo·phel, so that  Jehovah could bring disaster on Abʹsa·lom.","Huʹshai later said to Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar the priests: “This is what A·hithʹo·phel has advised Abʹsa·lom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised.","Now quickly send word to David and warn him: ‘Do not stay at the fords  of the wilderness tonight, but cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him may be wiped out.’”","Jonʹa·than and A·himʹa·az were staying at En-roʹgel; so a servant girl went off and told them and they went to tell King David, for they did not dare to be seen entering the city.","However, a young man saw them and told Abʹsa·lom. So the two of them quickly went off and came to the house of a man in Ba·huʹrim who had a well in his courtyard. They went down into it,","and the man’s wife spread a covering over the top of the well and covered it with cracked grain; no one knew about it.","The servants of Abʹsa·lom came to the woman at her house and asked: “Where are A·himʹa·az and Jonʹa·than?” The woman replied: “They passed by toward the water.” Then the men searched for them but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.","After the men were gone, they came up out of the well and went and informed King David. They said to him: “Rise up and quickly cross the water, for this is what A·hithʹo·phel advised against you.”","Immediately David and all the people with him rose up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan.","When A·hithʹo·phel saw that his advice had not been acted on, he saddled a donkey and went to his house in his hometown. After he gave instructions to his household, he hanged  himself. So he died and was buried in the burial place of his forefathers.","Meanwhile, David went to Ma·ha·naʹim, and Abʹsa·lom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.","Abʹsa·lom put A·maʹsa in charge of the army in place of Joʹab; A·maʹsa was the son of a man named Ithʹra the Israelite, who had relations with Abʹi·gail the daughter of Naʹhash, the sister of Ze·ruʹiah, Joʹab’s mother.","Israel and Abʹsa·lom camped in the land of Gilʹe·ad.","As soon as David came to Ma·ha·naʹim, Shoʹbi the son of Naʹhash from Rabʹbah of the Amʹmon·ites, Maʹchir the son of Amʹmi·el from Lo-deʹbar, and Bar·zilʹlai the Gilʹe·ad·ite from Ro·geʹlim","brought beds, basins, clay pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, broad beans, lentils, parched grain,","honey, butter, sheep, and cheese.  They brought all of this out for David and the people with him to eat, for they said: “The people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness.”"],["Then David numbered the men who were with him and placed over them chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds.","And David sent one third of the men under the command  of Joʹab, one third under the command of Joʹab’s brother A·bishʹai the son of Ze·ruʹiah, and one third under the command of Itʹtai the Gitʹtite. The king then said to the men: “I will  also go out with you.”","But they said: “You must not go out, for if we flee, they would not care about  us; and if half of us would die, they would not care about us, because you are worth 10,000 of us. Therefore, it would be better if you would send us help from the city.”","The king said to them: “Whatever seems best to you, I will do.” So the king stood next to the city gate, and all the men went out by hundreds and by thousands.","Then the king gave Joʹab and A·bishʹai and Itʹtai this order: “Deal gently with the young man Abʹsa·lom for my sake.” All the men heard it when the king gave all the chiefs the order about Abʹsa·lom.","The men went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Eʹphra·im.","There the people of Israel were defeated by the servants of David, and a great slaughter took place on that day—20,000 men.","The battle spread through the whole region. Furthermore, the forest devoured more of the people than the sword did on that day.","Abʹsa·lom eventually found himself facing the servants of David. Abʹsa·lom was riding on a mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a large tree, and his head got entangled in the big tree, so that he was suspended in midair  while the mule he had been riding kept going.","Then someone saw it and told Joʹab: “Look! I have seen Abʹsa·lom hanging in a big tree.”","Joʹab replied to the man who told him: “If you saw it, why did you not strike him down to the ground on the spot? Then I would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”","But the man said to Joʹab: “Even if I were handed  1,000 pieces of silver, I could not lift my hand against the king’s son, for we heard the king order you and A·bishʹai and Itʹtai, ‘Whoever you are, watch over the young man Abʹsa·lom.’","If I had disobeyed and taken his life,  it could never have remained hidden from the king, and you would not have protected me.”","To this Joʹab said: “I am not going to waste any more time with you!” So he took three spikes  in his hand and drove them through the heart of Abʹsa·lom while he was still alive in the midst of the big tree.","Then ten attendants who carried Joʹab’s weapons came and struck Abʹsa·lom until he was dead.","Joʹab now blew the horn, and the men returned from chasing after Israel; Joʹab called for them to halt.","They took Abʹsa·lom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up over him a very big heap of stones. And all Israel fled to their homes.","Now Abʹsa·lom, while he was alive, had taken and set up for himself a pillar in the Valley  of the King, for he said: “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he named the pillar after himself, and it is called Abʹsa·lom’s Monument to this day.","A·himʹa·az the son of Zaʹdok said: “Let me run, please, and break the news to the king, for Jehovah has given him justice by freeing him from his enemies.”","But Joʹab said to him: “You will not be a bearer of news this day. You may break the news on another day, but today  you will not break the news, because the king’s own son has died.”","Then Joʹab said to a Cushʹite: “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” At that the Cushʹite bowed to Joʹab and ran off.","A·himʹa·az the son of Zaʹdok said once again to Joʹab: “Whatever happens, please let me also run behind the Cushʹite.” However, Joʹab said: “Why should you run, my son, when there is no news for you to tell?”","Still he said: “Whatever happens, let me run.” So Joʹab said to him: “Run!” And A·himʹa·az ran by the way of the district of the Jordan,  and he eventually overtook the Cushʹite.","Now David was sitting between the two city gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall. He looked up and saw a man running by himself.","So the watchman called out and told the king. The king said: “If he is by himself, he has news to tell.” As he came steadily nearer,","the watchman saw another man running. The watchman then called to the gatekeeper: “Look! Another man running by himself!” The king said: “This one is also bringing news.”","The watchman said: “I can see that the first man runs like A·himʹa·az the son of Zaʹdok,” so the king said: “He is a good man, and he comes with good news.”","A·himʹa·az then called out to the king: “All is well!” With that he bowed to the king with his face to the ground. Then he said: “May Jehovah your God be praised, who has surrendered the men who rebelled  against my lord the king!”","However, the king said: “Is everything all right with the young man Abʹsa·lom?” To this A·himʹa·az said: “I saw the great commotion when Joʹab sent the king’s servant and your servant, but I did not know what it was.”","So the king said: “Step aside, stand here.” At that he stepped aside and stood there.","Then the Cushʹite arrived, and the Cushʹite said: “Let my lord the king accept this news: Today Jehovah has brought justice by freeing you from the hand of all those who rebelled against you.”","But the king said to the Cushʹite: “Is everything all right with the young man Abʹsa·lom?” To this the Cushʹite said: “May all the enemies of my lord the king and all those who rebelled against you to harm you become like the young man!”","This disturbed the king, and he went up to the roof chamber over the gateway and wept, saying as he walked: “My son Abʹsa·lom, my son, my son Abʹsa·lom! If only I had died instead of you, Abʹsa·lom my son, my son!”"],["It was reported to Joʹab: “The king is weeping and mourning for Abʹsa·lom.”","So the victory  on that day was turned into mourning for all the people, because they heard that the king was grieving over his son.","The people quietly returned to the city that day like people who are ashamed because they fled in the battle.","The king covered his face and kept crying out with a loud voice: “My son Abʹsa·lom! Abʹsa·lom my son, my son!”","Then Joʹab went in to the king at the house and said: “Today you have put to shame all your servants who this day saved your life  and the lives  of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines.","You love those who hate you and hate those who love you,  for you have made it clear today that your chiefs and servants mean nothing to you, because I am sure that if only Abʹsa·lom were alive today and the rest of us were dead, it would be all right with you.","Now get up, go out and reassure  your servants, because by Jehovah I swear that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the injury that has come upon you from your youth until now.”","So the king rose up and sat in the city gate, and all the people were informed: “Now the king is sitting in the gate.” Then all the people came before the king.","All the people in all the tribes of Israel were disputing, saying: “The king saved us from our enemies, and he rescued us from the Phi·lisʹtines; but now he has fled the land because of Abʹsa·lom.","And Abʹsa·lom, whom we anointed over us, has died in the battle. So now, why are you doing nothing to bring the king back?”","King David sent this message to Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar the priests: “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why should you be the last ones to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king at his house?","You are my brothers; you are my own bone and flesh.  Why should you be the last ones to bring the king back?’","And you should say to A·maʹsa, ‘Are you not my own bone and flesh? So may God do to me and add to it if you will not become my army chief from now on instead of Joʹab.’”","So he won over  the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent word to the king: “Come back, you and all your servants.”","The king started back and reached the Jordan, and the people of Judah came to Gilʹgal to meet the king and to escort him across the Jordan.","Then Shimʹe·i the son of Geʹra, the Benʹja·min·ite from Ba·huʹrim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David,","and there were 1,000 men from Benjamin with him. Also Ziʹba, the attendant of the house of Saul, with his 15 sons and 20 servants, rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king.","He  crossed the ford to bring the king’s household across and to do whatever he desired. But Shimʹe·i the son of Geʹra fell down before the king when he was about to cross the Jordan.","He said to the king: “Do not let my lord hold me guilty, and do not remember the wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart,","for your servant well knows that I have sinned; so today I have been the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”","At once A·bishʹai the son of Ze·ruʹiah said: “Should not Shimʹe·i be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of Jehovah?”","But David said: “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Ze·ruʹiah, that you should act against me today? Should anyone be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?”","Then the king said to Shimʹe·i: “You will not die.” And the king gave him his oath.","Me·phibʹo·sheth, the grandson of Saul, also came down to  meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his garments from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace.","When he came to  Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him: “Why did you not go with me, Me·phibʹo·sheth?”","To this he said: “My lord the king, my servant tricked me. For your servant had said, ‘Let me get my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for your servant is crippled.","But he slandered your servant to my lord the king. However, my lord the king is like an angel of the true God, so do whatever seems good to you.","All the household of my father could have been doomed to death by my lord the king, and yet you placed your servant among those eating at your table. So what right do I have to cry out further to the king?”","However, the king said to him: “Why keep on speaking like this? I have decided that you and Ziʹba should share the field.”","At this Me·phibʹo·sheth said to the king: “Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come to his house in peace.”","Then Bar·zilʹlai the Gilʹe·ad·ite came down from Ro·geʹlim to the Jordan to escort the king to the Jordan.","Bar·zilʹlai was very old, 80 years of age, and he supplied the king with food while he was staying in Ma·ha·naʹim, for he was a very wealthy man.","So the king said to Bar·zilʹlai: “Cross over with me, and I will supply you with food in Jerusalem.”","But Bar·zilʹlai said to the king: “How many days  of my life are left that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?","I am 80 years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can I, your servant, taste what I eat and drink? Can I still listen to the voice of male and female singers? So why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?","It is enough that your servant could bring the king to the Jordan. Why should the king repay me with this reward?","Let your servant return, please, and let me die in my city near the burial place of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimʹham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and you may do for him what seems good to you.”","So the king said: “Chimʹham will go across with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you; whatever you ask of me I will do for you.”","All the people now began to cross the Jordan, and when the king crossed, the king kissed Bar·zilʹlai and blessed him; and Bar·zilʹlai returned home.","When the king went across to Gilʹgal, Chimʹham crossed with him. All the people of Judah and half the people of Israel brought the king across.","Then all the men of Israel approached the king and said to him: “Why did our brothers the men of Judah steal you away and bring the king and his household over the Jordan, along with all of David’s men?”","All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: “Because the king is related to us. Why are you angry over this? Have we eaten anything at the king’s expense, or has a gift been given to us?”","However, the men of Israel answered the men of Judah: “We have ten parts in the king, so that we have a greater claim in David than you have. Why, then, have you treated us with contempt? Should we not have been  first to bring our king back?” But the word of the men of Judah prevailed over  that of the men of Israel."],["Now there was a troublemaker named Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri, a Benʹja·min·ite. He blew the horn and said: “We have no share in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesʹse. Everyone to his gods,  O Israel!”","At that all the men of Israel quit following David to follow Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri; but the men of Judah stuck to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.","When David came to his house  at Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the house, and he put them in a house under guard. He supplied food to them, but he did not have any relations with them. They remained in confinement until the day of their death, living as if they were widows, even though they had a living husband.","The king now said to A·maʹsa: “Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and you also should be here.”","So A·maʹsa went to call Judah together, but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him.","Then David said to A·bishʹai: “Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri may do us more harm than Abʹsa·lom did. Take the servants of your lord and chase after him, so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us.”","So the men of Joʹab, the Cherʹe·thites, the Pelʹe·thites, and all the mighty men went out after him; they left Jerusalem to chase after Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri.","When they were near the great stone in Gibʹe·on, A·maʹsa came to meet them. Now Joʹab was wearing his battle clothing, and he had a sword in its sheath strapped to his hip. When he stepped forward, the sword fell out.","Joʹab said to A·maʹsa: “Are you all right, my brother?” Then with his right hand, Joʹab took hold of A·maʹsa’s beard as if to kiss him.","A·maʹsa was not on guard against the sword that was in Joʹab’s hand, and Joʹab stabbed him with it in the abdomen, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. He did not have to stab him again; once was enough to kill him. Then Joʹab and his brother A·bishʹai chased after Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri.","One of Joʹab’s young men stood by him and was saying: “Whoever is on Joʹab’s side and whoever belongs to David, let him follow Joʹab!”","All the while A·maʹsa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that all the people were stopping, he moved A·maʹsa from the road to the field. Then he threw a garment over him, because he saw that everyone was stopping when they came up to him.","After he had removed him from the road, all the men followed Joʹab to chase after Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri.","Sheʹba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maʹa·cah. The Bichʹrites gathered together and also went in after him.","Joʹab and his men  came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maʹa·cah and raised up a siege rampart against the city, as it was standing within a rampart. And all the men with Joʹab were undermining the wall to knock it down.","And a wise  woman called out from the city: “Listen, men, listen! Please tell Joʹab, ‘Come here, and let me speak to you.’”","So he went near to her, and the woman said: “Are you Joʹab?” He replied: “I am.” At this she said to him: “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said: “I am listening.”","She continued: “They would always say in the past, ‘Let them inquire in Abel, and that was the end of the matter.’","I represent the peaceable and faithful ones of Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel. Why should you do away with  the inheritance of Jehovah?”","Joʹab answered: “It is unthinkable for me to do away with it and destroy it.","That is not the case at all. Rather, a man named Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri from the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im has rebelled  against King David. If you hand over this one man, I will withdraw from the city.” Then the woman said to Joʹab: “Look! His head will be thrown over the wall to you!”","At once the wise woman went in to all the people, and they cut off the head of Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri and threw it to Joʹab. At that he blew the horn, and they dispersed from the city, each one to his home; and Joʹab returned to Jerusalem to the king.","Now Joʹab was in charge of all the army of Israel; Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da was over the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites.","A·doʹram was over those conscripted for forced labor; Je·hoshʹa·phat the son of A·hiʹlud was the recorder.","Sheʹva was the secretary; Zaʹdok and A·biʹa·thar were priests.","And Iʹra the Jaʹir·ite also became a chief minister  for David."],["Now there was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years, so David consulted Jehovah, and Jehovah said: “There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibʹe·on·ites to death.”","So the king called the Gibʹe·on·ites and spoke to them. (Incidentally, the Gibʹe·on·ites were not Israelites but Amʹor·ites who remained, and the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.)","David said to the Gibʹe·on·ites: “What should I do for you, and how can I make atonement, so that you will bless the inheritance of Jehovah?”","The Gibʹe·on·ites said to him: “It is not a matter of silver or gold for us in connection with Saul and his household; nor can we put any man to death in Israel.” At that he said: “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”","They said to the king: “The man who exterminated us and schemed to annihilate us from living anywhere in the territory of Israel—","let seven of his sons be given to us. We will hang their dead bodies  before Jehovah in Gibʹe·ah of Saul, the chosen one of Jehovah.” The king then said: “I will hand them over.”","However, the king showed compassion for Me·phibʹo·sheth, the son of Jonʹa·than the son of Saul, because of the oath made before Jehovah between David and Jonʹa·than, the son of Saul.","So the king took Ar·moʹni and Me·phibʹo·sheth, the two sons of Rizʹpah the daughter of Aʹiah whom she bore to  Saul, and the five sons of Miʹchal  the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Aʹdri·el the son of Bar·zilʹlai the Me·holʹath·ite.","Then he handed them over to the Gibʹe·on·ites, and they hung their dead bodies on the mountain before Jehovah. All seven of them died together; they were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the start of the barley harvest.","Then Rizʹpah the daughter of Aʹiah took sackcloth and spread it out on the rock from the start of harvest until rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies; she did not allow the birds of the heavens to land on them by day nor the wild beasts of the field to come near by night.","David was told what Saul’s concubine Rizʹpah the daughter of Aʹiah had done.","So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonʹa·than from the leaders  of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Phi·lisʹtines had hung them on the day that the Phi·lisʹtines struck down Saul on Gil·boʹa.","He brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonʹa·than up from there, and they also gathered the bones of the men who had been executed.","Then they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonʹa·than his son in the land of Benjamin in Zeʹla in the tomb of Kish his father. After they did everything that the king had commanded, God listened to their entreaties for the land.","Once again there was war between the Phi·lisʹtines and Israel. So David and his servants went down and fought the Phi·lisʹtines, but David became exhausted.","A descendant of the Rephʹa·im named Ishʹbi-beʹnob, whose copper spear weighed 300 shekels  and who was armed with a new sword, intended to strike David down.","At once A·bishʹai the son of Ze·ruʹiah came to his aid and struck the Phi·lisʹtine down and put him to death. At that time the men of David swore this oath to him: “You must not go out with us to battle anymore! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!”","After this, war broke out again with the Phi·lisʹtines at Gob. At that time Sibʹbe·cai the Huʹshath·ite struck down Saph, who was a descendant of the Rephʹa·im.","And war broke out again with the Phi·lisʹtines at Gob, and El·haʹnan the son of Jaʹa·re-orʹe·gim the Bethʹle·hem·ite struck down Go·liʹath the Gitʹtite, whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers.","War broke out yet again at Gath, where there was a man of extraordinary size, with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot, 24 in all; and he too was a descendant of the Rephʹa·im.","He kept taunting Israel. So Jonʹa·than the son of Shimʹe·i, David’s brother, struck him down.","These four were descendants of the Rephʹa·im in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."],["And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of Saul’s hand.","He said:","3  My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,","4  I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,","5  The waves of death broke all around me;","6  The ropes of the Grave  surrounded me;","7  In my distress I called on Jehovah,","8  Back and forth the earth began to shake and rock;","9  Smoke ascended from his nostrils,","He made the heavens bend as he descended,","He rode on a cherub and came flying.","Then he put darkness around him as a shelter,","From the brightness before him fiery coals blazed.","Then Jehovah began to thunder from heaven;","He shot his arrows and scattered them;","The bed of the sea became visible;","He reached down from on high;","He rescued me from my strong enemy,","They confronted me on the day of my disaster,","He brought me out into a place of safety;","Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;","For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,","All his judgments are before me;","I will remain blameless before him,","May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,","With someone loyal you act in loyalty;","With the pure you show yourself pure,","For you save those who are humble,","For you are my lamp, O Jehovah;","With your help I can charge against a marauder band;","The way of the true God is perfect;","For who is a God besides Jehovah?","The true God is my strong fortress,","He makes my feet like those of a deer;","He trains my hands for warfare;","You give me your shield of salvation,","You widen the path for my footsteps;","I will pursue my enemies and annihilate them;","And I will wipe them out and crush them, so that they will not rise up;","You will equip me with strength for the battle;","You will make my enemies retreat from me;","They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;","I will pound them as fine as the dust of the earth;","You will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people.","Foreigners will come cringing before me;","Foreigners will lose courage;","Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!","The true God executes vengeance for me;","He rescues me from my enemies.","That is why I will thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations,","He performs great acts of salvation  for his king;"],["These are the last words of David:","2  The spirit of Jehovah spoke through me;","3  The God of Israel spoke;","4  It is like the morning light when the sun shines,","5  Is not my house like that before God?","6  But worthless men are all thrown away like thornbushes,","7  When a man touches them,","These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: Joʹsheb-bas·sheʹbeth a Tah·cheʹmo·nite, the head of the three. He brandished his spear over 800 slain at one time.","Next to him, El·e·aʹzar the son of Doʹdo the son of A·hoʹhi was among the three mighty warriors with David when they taunted the Phi·lisʹtines. They had gathered there for the battle, and when the men of Israel retreated,","he stood his ground and kept striking down the Phi·lisʹtines until his arm grew weary and his hand became stiff from gripping the sword. So Jehovah brought  about a great victory  on that day; and the people returned behind him to strip the slain.","Next to him was Shamʹmah the son of Aʹgee the Harʹa·rite. The Phi·lisʹtines gathered together at Leʹhi, where there was a plot of land full of lentils; and the people fled because of the Phi·lisʹtines.","But he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the Phi·lisʹtines, so that Jehovah brought about a great victory.","Three of the 30 headmen went down during the harvest to David at the cave of A·dulʹlam, and a company  of the Phi·lisʹtines was camped in the Valley  of Rephʹa·im.","David was then in the stronghold, and an outpost of the Phi·lisʹtines was in Bethʹle·hem.","Then David expressed his longing: “If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethʹle·hem!”","At that the three mighty warriors forced their way into the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethʹle·hem and brought it to David; but he refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah.","He said: “It is unthinkable on my part, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives?”  So he refused to drink it. These are the things that his three mighty warriors did.","A·bishʹai the brother of Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah was the head of another three; he brandished his spear over 300 slain, and he had a reputation like the three.","Although he was the most distinguished of the other three and he was their chief, he did not attain to the rank of the first three.","Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da was a courageous man  who performed many exploits in Kabʹze·el. He struck down the two sons of Arʹi·el of Moʹab, and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion.","He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size. Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.","These things Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da did, and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors.","Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty, he did not attain to the rank of the three. However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.","Asʹa·hel the brother of Joʹab was among the thirty: El·haʹnan the son of Doʹdo of Bethʹle·hem,","Shamʹmah the Haʹrod·ite, E·liʹka the Haʹrod·ite,","Heʹlez the Palʹtite, Iʹra the son of Ikʹkesh the Te·koʹite,","Abi-eʹzer the Anʹa·thoth·ite, Me·bunʹnai the Huʹshath·ite,","Zalʹmon the A·hoʹhite, Maʹha·rai the Ne·tophʹa·thite,","Heʹleb the son of Baʹa·nah the Ne·tophʹa·thite, Itʹtai the son of Riʹbai of Gibʹe·ah of the Benʹja·min·ites,","Be·naiʹah a Pirʹa·thon·ite, Hidʹdai of the wadis  of Gaʹash,","Aʹbi-alʹbon the Arʹbath·ite, Azʹma·veth the Bar-huʹmite,","E·liʹah·ba the Sha·alʹbo·nite, the sons of Jaʹshen, Jonʹa·than,","Shamʹmah the Harʹa·rite, A·hiʹam the son of Shaʹrar the Harʹa·rite,","E·liphʹe·let the son of A·hasʹbai the son of the Ma·acʹa·thite, E·liʹam the son of A·hithʹo·phel the Giʹlon·ite,","Hezʹro the Carʹmel·ite, Paʹa·rai the Arʹbite,","Iʹgal the son of Nathan of Zoʹbah, Baʹni the Gadʹite,","Zeʹlek the Amʹmon·ite, Naʹha·rai the Be·erʹoth·ite, the armor-bearer of Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah,","Iʹra the Ithʹrite, Gaʹreb the Ithʹrite,","and U·riʹah the Hitʹtite—37 in all."],["The anger of Jehovah again blazed against Israel when one incited David  against them, saying: “Go, take a count of Israel and Judah.”","So the king said to Joʹab the chief of the army who was with him: “Please go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba, and register the people, so that I may know the number of the people.”","But Joʹab said to the king: “May Jehovah your God multiply the people 100 times, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it, but why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”","But the king’s word prevailed over Joʹab and the chiefs of the army. So Joʹab and the chiefs of the army went out from before the king to register the people of Israel.","They crossed the Jordan and camped at A·roʹer, to the right  of the city in the middle of the valley,  and they went toward the Gadʹites and on to Jaʹzer.","After that they went on to Gilʹe·ad and the land of Tahʹtim-hodʹshi and continued to Dan-jaʹan and went around to Siʹdon.","Then they went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hiʹvites and of the Caʹnaan·ites, and finally they ended up in the Negʹeb of Judah at Beʹer-sheʹba.","Thus they went through all the land and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days.","Joʹab now gave to the king the number of the people who were registered. Israel amounted to 800,000 warriors armed with swords, and the men of Judah were 500,000.","But David’s heart  was struck with remorse after he had numbered the people. David then said to Jehovah: “I have sinned greatly by doing this. And now, Jehovah, please forgive your servant’s error, for I have acted very foolishly.”","When David got up in the morning, Jehovah’s word came to Gad the prophet, David’s visionary, saying:","“Go and say to David, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “I am giving you three options. Choose the one that I should bring on you.”’”","So Gad came in to David and told him: “Should seven years of famine come on your land? Or should you flee for three months from your adversaries while they pursue you? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider carefully what I should reply to the One who sent me.”","So David said to Gad: “It is very distressing to me. Let us fall, please, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”","Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the designated time, so that 70,000 of the people from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba died.","When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah felt regret  over the calamity, and he said to the angel bringing destruction among the people: “It is  enough! Now let your hand drop.” Jehovah’s angel was close to the threshing floor of A·rauʹnah the Jebʹu·site.","When David saw the angel who was striking the people down, he said to Jehovah: “I am the one who sinned, and I am the one who did wrong; but these sheep—what have they done? Let your hand, please, come against me and my father’s house.”","So Gad came in to David on that day and said to him: “Go up, set up for Jehovah an altar on the threshing floor of A·rauʹnah the Jebʹu·site.”","So David went up at the word of Gad, as Jehovah had commanded.","When A·rauʹnah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, A·rauʹnah immediately went out and bowed down to the king with his face to the ground.","A·rauʹnah asked: “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David replied: “To buy from you the threshing floor in order to build an altar to Jehovah, so that the scourge against the people may be halted.”","But A·rauʹnah said to David: “Let my lord the king take it and offer up what seems good to him.  Here are cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the equipment of the cattle for the wood.","All of this, O king, A·rauʹnah gives to the king.” Then A·rauʹnah said to the king: “May Jehovah your God show you favor.”","However, the king said to A·rauʹnah: “No, I must buy it from you for a price. I will not offer up to Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for 50 silver shekels.","And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices. Jehovah then responded to the entreaty for the land, and the scourge against Israel was halted."]],"1 Kings":[["Now King David was old, advanced in years,  and although they would cover him with garments, he could not get warm.","So his servants said to him: “Let a girl, a virgin, be found for my lord the king, and she will wait on the king as his nurse. She will lie in your arms so that my lord the king may feel warm.”","They searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite and brought her in to the king.","The girl was extremely beautiful, and she became the king’s nurse and waited on him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.","Meanwhile, Ad·o·niʹjah the son of Hagʹgith was exalting himself, saying: “I am going to be king!” He had a chariot made for himself with horsemen and 50 men to run before him.","But his father had never confronted him  by saying: “Why have you done this?” He was also very handsome, and his mother had given birth to him after Abʹsa·lom.","He conferred with Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah and A·biʹa·thar the priest, and they offered Ad·o·niʹjah help and support.","But Zaʹdok the priest, Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, Nathan the prophet, Shimʹe·i, Reʹi, and David’s mighty warriors did not support Ad·o·niʹjah.","Eventually Ad·o·niʹjah held a sacrifice of sheep, cattle, and fattened animals by the stone of Zoʹhe·leth, which is near En-roʹgel, and he invited all his brothers the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants.","But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Be·naiʹah and the mighty warriors, or Solʹo·mon his brother.","Nathan then said to Bath-sheʹba, Solʹo·mon’s mother: “Have you not heard that Ad·o·niʹjah the son of Hagʹgith has become king, and our lord David does not know anything about it?","So now come, please, and let me advise you, so that you may save your own life and the life of  your son Solʹo·mon.","Go in to King David and say to him, ‘Was it not you, my lord the king, who swore to your servant, saying: “Your son Solʹo·mon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne”? So why has Ad·o·niʹjah become king?’","While you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”","So Bath-sheʹba went in to the king, into his private room. The king was very old, and Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite was waiting on the king.","Then Bath-sheʹba bowed low and prostrated herself to the king, and the king said: “What is your request?”","She replied: “My lord, it was you who swore by Jehovah your God to your servant, ‘Your son Solʹo·mon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne.’","But look! Ad·o·niʹjah has become king, and my lord the king does not know anything about it.","He sacrificed bulls, fattened animals, and sheep in great quantity and invited all the sons of the king and A·biʹa·thar the priest and Joʹab the chief of the army; but he did not invite your servant Solʹo·mon.","And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.","Otherwise, as soon  as my lord the king is laid to rest with his forefathers, I and also my son Solʹo·mon will be considered traitors.”","And while she was still speaking to the king, Nathan the prophet came in.","At once the king was told: “Here is Nathan the prophet!” He came in before the king and prostrated himself to the king with his face to the ground.","Then Nathan said: “My lord the king, did you say, ‘Ad·o·niʹjah will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne’?","For today he has gone down to sacrifice bulls, fattened animals, and sheep in great quantity, and he has invited all the sons of the king and the chiefs of the army and A·biʹa·thar the priest. They are there eating and drinking with him, and they keep saying, ‘Long live King Ad·o·niʹjah!’","But he did not invite me, your servant, or Zaʹdok the priest, or Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, or your servant Solʹo·mon.","Has my lord the king authorized this without telling your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”","King David now answered: “Call Bath-sheʹba for me.” At that she came in and stood before the king.","The king then swore an oath: “As surely as Jehovah is living, the one who rescued me  out of all distress,","just as I swore to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, ‘Your son Solʹo·mon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne in my place!’ that is what I will bring about this day.”","Then Bath-sheʹba bowed low with her face to the ground and prostrated herself to the king and said: “May my lord King David live forever!”","Immediately King David said: “Call for me Zaʹdok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da.” So they came in before the king.","The king said to them: “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solʹo·mon ride on my own mule,  and lead him down to Giʹhon.","Zaʹdok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him there as king over Israel; then blow the horn and say, ‘Long live King Solʹo·mon!’","Then follow him back, and he will come in and sit on my throne; and he will be king in my place, and I will commission him as leader over Israel and over Judah.”","At once Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da said to the king: “Amen! May Jehovah the God of my lord the king confirm it.","Just as Jehovah was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solʹo·mon, and may He make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”","Then Zaʹdok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, and the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites went down and had Solʹo·mon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Giʹhon.","Zaʹdok the priest now took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed Solʹo·mon, and they began to blow the horn, and all the people began shouting: “Long live King Solʹo·mon!”","After that all the people followed him and went up, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the earth was split open by their noise.","Ad·o·niʹjah and all those invited by him heard it when they had finished eating. As  soon as Joʹab heard the sound of the horn, he said: “Why is there such a noisy uproar in the city?”","While he was still speaking, Jonʹa·than the son of A·biʹa·thar the priest came. Then Ad·o·niʹjah said: “Come in, for you are a good  man, and you must bring good news.”","But Jonʹa·than answered Ad·o·niʹjah: “No! Our lord King David has made Solʹo·mon king.","The king sent with him Zaʹdok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, and the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites, and they had him ride on the mule of the king.","Then Zaʹdok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king in Giʹhon. After that they came up from there rejoicing, and the city is in an uproar. That was the noise that you heard.","Moreover, Solʹo·mon has sat down on the royal throne.","Another thing, the servants of the king have come in to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solʹo·mon’s name more splendid than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne!’ At that the king bowed down on the bed.","And the king also said, ‘May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, who today has granted someone to sit on my throne and has allowed my own eyes to see it!’”","And all those invited by Ad·o·niʹjah became terrified, and each of them rose up and went his own way.","Ad·o·niʹjah was also afraid because of Solʹo·mon, so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.","The report was made to Solʹo·mon: “Here Ad·o·niʹjah has become afraid of King Solʹo·mon; and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solʹo·mon first swear to me that he will not put his servant to death by the sword.’”","To this Solʹo·mon said: “If he behaves in a worthy manner, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground; but if what is bad is found in him, he will have to die.”","So King Solʹo·mon sent for him to be brought down from the altar. Then he came in and bowed down to King Solʹo·mon, after which Solʹo·mon said to him: “Go to your own house.”"],["When the time of David’s death drew near, he gave his son Solʹo·mon these instructions:","“I am about to die.  Therefore, be strong and prove yourself a man.","You must keep your obligation to Jehovah your God by walking in his ways and by observing his statutes, his commandments, his judgments, and his reminders as they are written in the Law of Moses; then you will succeed  in everything you do and everywhere you turn.","And Jehovah will carry out his promise that he made concerning me: ‘If your sons pay attention to their way by walking faithfully before me with all their heart and soul,  there will never fail to be a man of your line  sitting on the throne of Israel.’","“You also well know what Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah did to me, what he did to two chiefs of the armies of Israel—Abʹner the son of Ner and A·maʹsa the son of Jeʹther. He killed them, shedding the blood of war in peacetime, and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet.","You must act according to your wisdom and not let his gray  hairs go down in peace to the Grave.","“But toward the sons of Bar·zilʹlai the Gilʹe·ad·ite, you should show loyal love, and they should be among those eating at your table, for that was how they stood by me when I ran away from your brother Abʹsa·lom.","“There is also with you Shimʹe·i the son of Geʹra the Benʹja·min·ite from Ba·huʹrim. He was the one who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day that I was going to Ma·ha·naʹim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by Jehovah: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’","Now do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man and you know what you should do to him; you must bring his gray hairs down to the Grave  with blood.”","Then David was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David.","The length  of David’s reign over Israel was 40 years. In Hebʹron he reigned for 7 years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years.","Solʹo·mon then sat down on the throne of David his father, and gradually his kingship became firmly established.","In time Ad·o·niʹjah the son of Hagʹgith came to Bath-sheʹba, Solʹo·mon’s mother. She asked: “Is your coming peaceable?” He replied: “It is peaceable.”","He then said: “I have something to say to you.” So she said: “Speak.”","He continued: “You well know that the kingship was to become mine, and all Israel expected  me to become king; but the kingship eluded me and became my brother’s, for it was from Jehovah that it became his.","But now there is just one request that I am making of you. Do not turn me away.” So she said to him: “Speak.”","He then said: “Please, ask Solʹo·mon the king—for he will not turn you away—to give me Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite as a wife.”","To this Bath-sheʹba said: “Very well! I will speak for you to the king.”","So Bath-sheʹba went in to King Solʹo·mon to speak to him for Ad·o·niʹjah. At once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king’s mother, so that she could sit at his right.","She then said: “There is one small request that I am making of you. Do not turn me away.” So the king said to her: “Make it, my mother; for I will not turn you away.”","She said: “Let Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite be given as a wife to your brother Ad·o·niʹjah.”","At this King Solʹo·mon answered his mother: “Why are you requesting Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite for Ad·o·niʹjah? You may as well request the kingship for him, for he is my older brother, and supporting him are A·biʹa·thar the priest and Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah.”","With that King Solʹo·mon swore by Jehovah: “So may God do to me and add to it if it was not at the cost of his own life  that Ad·o·niʹjah made this request.","And now, as surely as Jehovah is living, who has firmly established me and seated me on the throne of David my father and who made a house  for me, just as he promised, Ad·o·niʹjah will be put to death today.”","King Solʹo·mon immediately sent Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, who went out and  struck Ad·o·niʹjah down,  and he died.","To A·biʹa·thar the priest, the king said: “Go to your fields in Anʹa·thoth! You deserve to die, but on this day I will not put you to death because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah before David my father and because you shared in all the hardships that my father suffered.”","So Solʹo·mon drove A·biʹa·thar out from serving as a priest of Jehovah, to fulfill Jehovah’s word against the house of Eʹli in Shiʹloh.","When the news reached Joʹab—for Joʹab had supported Ad·o·niʹjah but he had not supported Abʹsa·lom—Joʹab fled to the tent of Jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar.","Then King Solʹo·mon was told: “Joʹab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and he is there beside the altar.” So Solʹo·mon sent Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, saying: “Go, strike him down!”","So Be·naiʹah went to the tent of Jehovah and said to him: “This is what the king says, ‘Come out!’” But he said: “No! I will die here.” Be·naiʹah brought word back to the king: “This is what Joʹab said, and this is what he answered me.”","Then the king said to him: “Do just as he said; strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that Joʹab spilled without just cause.","Jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head, for without my father David’s knowledge, he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was: Abʹner the son of Ner, the chief of the army of Israel, and A·maʹsa the son of Jeʹther, the chief of the army of Judah.","Their blood will come back on the head of Joʹab and on the head of his offspring  forever; but for David, his offspring,  his house, and his throne, may there be peace from Jehovah forever.”","Then Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da went up and struck Joʹab down and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.","Then the king appointed Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zaʹdok the priest in place of A·biʹa·thar.","Then the king summoned Shimʹe·i and said to him: “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there; do not go out from there to any other place.","On the day you go out and cross the Kidʹron Valley, you can be sure that you will die. Your blood will be on your own head.”","Shimʹe·i replied to the king: “What you have said is fair. Your servant will do just as my lord the king has said.” So Shimʹe·i stayed in Jerusalem for many days.","But at the end of three years, two of Shimʹe·i’s slaves ran away to Aʹchish the son of Maʹa·cah the king of Gath. When Shimʹe·i was told: “Look! Your slaves are in Gath,”","Shimʹe·i immediately saddled his donkey and went to see Aʹchish in Gath to find his slaves. When Shimʹe·i returned from Gath with his slaves,","Solʹo·mon was told: “Shimʹe·i has gone out of Jerusalem to Gath and has returned.”","At that the king summoned Shimʹe·i and said to him: “Did I not put you under oath by Jehovah and warn you: ‘On the day you go out from here to any other place, you can be sure that you will die’? And did you not say to me,  ‘What you are saying is fair; I will obey’?","Why, then, did you not keep the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I imposed on you?”","The king then said to Shimʹe·i: “You know in your heart all the injury that you did to David my father, and Jehovah will bring back that injury on your own head.","But King Solʹo·mon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be firmly established before Jehovah forever.”","With that the king commanded Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, who went out and struck him down, and he died."],["Solʹo·mon made a marriage alliance with Pharʹaoh king of Egypt. He married  Pharʹaoh’s daughter and brought her to the City of David until he finished building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall around Jerusalem.","But the people were still sacrificing on the high places, because until that time a house for the name of Jehovah had not yet been built.","Solʹo·mon continued to love Jehovah by walking in the statutes of David his father, except that he was sacrificing and making offerings smoke on the high places.","The king went to Gibʹe·on to sacrifice there, for that was the most prominent  high place. Solʹo·mon offered 1,000 burnt sacrifices on that altar.","In Gibʹe·on Jehovah appeared to Solʹo·mon in a dream by night, and God said: “Ask what you would like me to give you.”","At this Solʹo·mon said: “You have shown great loyal love toward your servant David my father as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart. You have continued to show him this great loyal love down to this day by giving him a son to sit on his throne.","And now, Jehovah my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David my father, though I am just a youth  and I am inexperienced.","Your servant is among your people whom you have chosen, a people so vast that they cannot be numbered or counted.","So grant your servant an obedient heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, for who is able to judge this numerous  people of yours?”","It was pleasing to Jehovah that Solʹo·mon had requested this.","God then said to him: “Because you requested this and you did not request for yourself long life  or riches or the death  of your enemies, but you requested understanding to hear judicial cases,","I will do what you asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that just as there has never been anyone like you before, there will never be anyone like you again.","Furthermore, what you have not requested I will give you, both riches and glory, so that there will be no other king like you in your lifetime.","And if you walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments, just as David your father walked, I will also give you a long life.”","When Solʹo·mon awoke, he realized that it had been a  dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion offerings and spread a feast for all his servants.","At that time two prostitutes came in to the king and stood before him.","The first woman said: “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in one house, and I gave birth while she was in the house.","On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together, just the two of us; there was no one else with us in the house.","During the night this woman’s son died, because she lay on him.","So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your slave girl was asleep and laid him in her arms,  and she laid her dead son in my arms.","When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, I saw that he was dead. So I examined him closely in the morning and saw that it was not my son whom I had given birth to.”","But the other woman said: “No, my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one!” But the first woman was saying: “No, your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.” That is how they argued before the king.","Finally the king said: “This one says, ‘This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one!’ and that one says, ‘No, your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one!’”","The king said: “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword to the king.","The king then said: “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other.”","At once the woman whose son was the living one pleaded with the king, for her compassions were stirred toward her son. She said: “Please, my lord! You should give her the living child! By no means put him to death!” But the other woman was saying: “He will be neither mine nor yours! Let them cut him in two!”","At that the king answered: “Give the living child to the first woman!

So he came to King Solʹo·mon and did all his work.","He cast the two pillars of copper; each pillar was 18 cubits high, and it took a measuring cord 12 cubits long to encircle each of the two pillars.","And he made two capitals cast in copper to put on the tops of the pillars. One capital was five cubits high, and the other capital was five cubits high.","The capital on top of each pillar had mesh network with wreathed chains; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.","And he made pomegranates in two rows around the one network to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; he did the same for both capitals.","The capitals on top of the pillars at the porch were of a lily pattern four cubits high.","The capitals were on the two pillars, just above the rounded portion adjoining the network; and there were 200 pomegranates in rows all around on each capital.","He set up the pillars of the porch of the temple.  He set up the right-hand  pillar and named it Jaʹchin,  and then he set up the left-hand  pillar and named it Boʹaz.","And the top of the pillars were of a lily pattern. So the work of the pillars was completed.","Then he made the Sea  of cast metal.

It would hold 2,000 bath measures.","Then he made the ten carriages  of copper. Each carriage was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.","And this was how the carriages were constructed: They had side panels, and the side panels were between the crossbars.","And on the side panels between the crossbars were lions, bulls, and cherubs, and the same design was on the crossbars.

And their side panels were square, not round.","The four wheels were below the side panels, and the supports of the wheels were attached to the carriage, and the height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.","And the wheels were made like chariot wheels. Their supports, rims,  spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal.","There were four supports on the four corners of each carriage; its supports were cast as part of  the carriage.","On top of the carriage was a circular band half a cubit high, and on the top of the carriage, its framing pieces and its side panels were cast as part of  it.","On the surfaces of its framing pieces and on its side panels he engraved cherubs, lions, and palm trees according to the amount of space on each, with wreaths all around.","This is how he made the ten carriages; they were all cast alike, with the same measure and shape.","He made ten copper basins; each could hold 40 bath measures.

So many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered.","Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, underneath the wings of the cherubs.","Thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs overshadowed the Ark and its poles.","The poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible from outside. And they are there to this day.","There was nothing in the Ark but the two stone tablets that Moses placed there at Horʹeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel while they were coming out of the land of Egypt.","When the priests came out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah.","The priests were not able to stand to minister because of  the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.","At that time Solʹo·mon said: “Jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom.","I have successfully built a lofty house for you, an established place for you to dwell in forever.”","Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood.","He said: “May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David, and by his own hand has given fulfillment, saying,","‘From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’","And it was the heart’s desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.","But Jehovah said to my father David, ‘It was your heart’s desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart.","However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you  is the one who will build the house for my name.’","Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised. I have also built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel","and have set up a place there for the Ark containing the covenant that Jehovah made with our forefathers when he was bringing them out of the land of Egypt.”","Then Solʹo·mon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he spread his hands out to the heavens,","and he said: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart.","You have kept the promise that you made to your servant David my father. You made the promise with your own mouth, and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand.","And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant David my father when you said: ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking before me, just as you have walked before me.’","And now, O God of Israel, let the promise that you made to your servant David my father prove trustworthy, please.","“But will God really dwell on the earth? Look! The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built!","Now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you today.","May your eyes be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, ‘My name will be there,’ to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.","And listen to your servant’s request for favor and to the request by your people Israel that they pray toward this place, and  may you hear from your dwelling place in the heavens; yes, may you hear and forgive.","“When a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath  and is brought under liability to the oath,  and while under the oath  he comes before your altar in this house,","may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by pronouncing the wicked one guilty  and bringing what he did on his own head, and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent  and rewarding him according to his own righteousness.","“When your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you, and they return to you and glorify your name and pray and beg you for favor in this house,","may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to their forefathers.","“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you, and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled  them,","may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants, of your people Israel, for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.","“If a famine occurs in the land, or a pestilence, a scorching blight, mildew, swarming locusts, or voracious locusts;  or if their enemy besieges them in any of the cities of the land  or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs,","whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel (for each one knows the plague of his own heart) when they spread out their hands toward this house,","then may you hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and may you forgive and take action; and reward each one according to all his ways, for you know his heart (you alone truly know every human heart),","so that they may fear you all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers.","“Also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes from a distant land because of your name","(for they will hear about your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm), and he comes and prays toward this house,","may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.","“If your people go to war against their enemy in the way that you send them, and they pray to Jehovah in the direction of the city that you have chosen and toward the house that I have built for your name,","then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them.","“If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy, and their captors carry them off captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;","and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive, and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’","and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul  in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive, and they pray to you in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and of the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,","then hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, their prayer and their request for favor, and execute judgment for them","and forgive your people who have sinned against you, forgiving all their transgressions they committed against you. You will make them objects of pity before their captors, and they will pity them","(for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, from inside the iron-smelting furnace).","May your eyes be opened to your servant’s request for favor and to the request for favor by your people Israel by listening whenever they call to you.","For you set them apart as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth, just as you declared through Moses your servant when you were bringing our forefathers out of Egypt, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”","And as soon as Solʹo·mon finished offering to Jehovah this entire prayer and request for favor, he rose up from before the altar of Jehovah, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out to the heavens.","He then stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:","“Praised be Jehovah, who has given a resting-place to his people Israel, just as he promised. Not one word of all his good promise that he made through Moses his servant has failed.","May Jehovah our God be with us just as he was with our forefathers. May he not abandon us nor forsake us.","May he draw our heart toward himself, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his regulations, and his judgments, which he commanded our forefathers to observe.","And may these words of mine with which I have begged Jehovah for favor be near to Jehovah our God by day and night, that he may execute judgment for his servant and for his people Israel as each day requires,","so that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is the true God. There is no other!","So let your heart be complete with  Jehovah our God by walking in his regulations and by keeping his commandments as on this day.”","Now the king and all Israel with him offered a grand sacrifice before Jehovah.","Solʹo·mon offered the communion sacrifices to Jehovah: He offered 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the Israelites inaugurated the house of Jehovah.","On that day the king  had to sanctify the middle of the courtyard that is before the house of Jehovah, for there he had to offer up the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, because the copper altar that is before Jehovah was too small to contain the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices.","At that time Solʹo·mon held the festival together with all Israel, a great congregation from Leʹbo-haʹmath  down to the Wadi  of Egypt, before Jehovah our God for 7 days and then another 7 days, 14 days in all.","On the following  day, he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over all the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David his servant and Israel his people."],["As soon as Solʹo·mon had finished building the house of Jehovah, the house  of the king, and everything Solʹo·mon desired to make,","Jehovah appeared to Solʹo·mon a second time, just as he had appeared to him in Gibʹe·on.","Jehovah said to him: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor that you made before me. I have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there, and my eyes and my heart will always be there.","And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, with integrity of heart and with uprightness, by doing everything I have commanded you, and you obey my regulations and my judgments,","then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying, ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel.’","But if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them,","I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land that I have given to them, and the house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become an object of scorn  and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples.","And this house will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say, ‘Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house?’","Then they will say, ‘It was because they abandoned Jehovah their God, who had brought their forefathers out of the land of Egypt, and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. That is why Jehovah brought all this calamity on them.’”","At the end of 20 years, during which Solʹo·mon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house  of the king,","Hiʹram the king of Tyre had supplied Solʹo·mon with cedar and juniper timbers and with as much gold as he desired, and King Solʹo·mon gave to Hiʹram 20 cities in the land of Galʹi·lee.","So Hiʹram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solʹo·mon had given him, but he was not satisfied with them.","He said: “What sort of cities are these that you have given me,  my brother?” So they came to be called the Land of Caʹbul  down to this day.","In the meantime, Hiʹram sent to the king 120 talents  of gold.","This is the account of those whom King Solʹo·mon conscripted for forced labor to build the house of Jehovah, his own house,  the Mound,  the wall of Jerusalem, Haʹzor, Me·gidʹdo, and Geʹzer.","(Pharʹaoh king of Egypt had come up and captured Geʹzer and had burned it with fire, and he had also killed the Caʹnaan·ites dwelling in the city. So he gave it as a parting gift  to his daughter, the wife of Solʹo·mon.)","Solʹo·mon built up  Geʹzer, Lower Beth-hoʹron,","Baʹal·ath, and Taʹmar in the wilderness, within the land,","as well as all of Solʹo·mon’s storage cities, the chariot cities, the cities for the horsemen, and whatever Solʹo·mon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebʹa·non, and in all the land of his dominion.","As for all the people who were left from the Amʹor·ites, the Hitʹtites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, who were not part of the people of Israel,","their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had been unable to devote to destruction—were conscripted by Solʹo·mon for forced labor as slaves until this day.","But Solʹo·mon did not make any of the Israelites slaves, for they were his warriors, servants, princes, adjutants, and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen.","There were 550 chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Solʹo·mon, the foremen over the people who were doing the work.","But Pharʹaoh’s daughter came up from the City of David to her own house that he had built for her; then he built the Mound.","Three times a year Solʹo·mon offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices on the altar that he had built for Jehovah, also making sacrificial smoke on the altar, which was before Jehovah, so he completed the house.","King Solʹo·mon also made a fleet of ships in Eʹzi·on-geʹber, which is by Eʹloth, on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Eʹdom.","Hiʹram sent his own servants with the fleet of ships, experienced seamen, to serve along with the servants of Solʹo·mon.","They went to Oʹphir and took from there 420 talents of gold and brought it to King Solʹo·mon."],["Now the queen of Sheʹba heard the report about Solʹo·mon in connection with the name of Jehovah, so she came to test him with perplexing questions.","She arrived in Jerusalem with a very impressive entourage,  with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones. She went in to Solʹo·mon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart.","Solʹo·mon then answered all her questions. There was nothing too difficult for  the king to explain to her.","When the queen of Sheʹba had seen all the wisdom of Solʹo·mon, the house that he built,","the food of his table,  the seating of his servants, the table service of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, she was left completely breathless.","So she said to the king: “The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements  and about your wisdom was true.","But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes. And look! I had not been told the half. You have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that I heard.","Happy are your men, and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly, listening to your wisdom!","May Jehovah your God be praised, who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on the throne of Israel. Because of Jehovah’s everlasting love for Israel, he appointed you as king to administer justice and righteousness.”","Then she gave the king 120 talents  of gold and a great amount of balsam oil and precious stones. Never again was such a quantity of balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheʹba gave to King Solʹo·mon.","Hiʹram’s fleet of ships that carried gold from Oʹphir also brought from Oʹphir algum timbers in very great quantity, and precious stones.","The king made from the algum timbers supports for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house,  as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers. Such algum timbers have never again been brought in or seen down to this day.","King Solʹo·mon also gave the queen of Sheʹba whatever she desired and asked for, in addition to what he gave her out of his own generosity.  After that she left and returned to her own land, together with her servants.","And the weight of the gold that came to Solʹo·mon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold,","besides that from the merchants and the profit from the traders and from all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land.","King Solʹo·mon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold (600 shekels  of gold went on each shield)","and 300 bucklers  of alloyed gold (three miʹnas  of gold went on each buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebʹa·non.","The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with refined gold.","There were six steps to the throne, and the throne had a round canopy behind it, and there were armrests on both sides of the seat, and two lions were standing beside the armrests.","And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps, one at each end of the six steps. No other kingdom had made anything like it.","All the drinking vessels of King Solʹo·mon were of gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebʹa·non were of pure gold. There was nothing made of silver, for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solʹo·mon.","For  the king had a fleet of ships of Tarʹshish on the sea along with Hiʹram’s fleet. Once every three years, the fleet of ships of Tarʹshish would come loaded with gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.","So King Solʹo·mon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.","And people of all the earth sought an audience with  Solʹo·mon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart.","They would each bring a gift—articles of silver, articles of gold, garments, armor, balsam oil, horses, and mules—and this continued year after year.","And Solʹo·mon kept accumulating chariots and horses;  he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses,  and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem.","The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the She·pheʹlah.","The horses of Solʹo·mon had been imported from Egypt, and the company of the king’s merchants would obtain the horses in droves  for one price.","Each chariot imported from Egypt cost 600 silver pieces, and a horse cost 150; in turn, they would export them to all the kings of the Hitʹtites and the kings of Syria."],["But King Solʹo·mon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of Pharʹaoh: Moʹab·ite, Amʹmon·ite, Eʹdom·ite, Si·doʹni·an, and Hitʹtite women.","They were from the nations about whom Jehovah had said to the Israelites: “You must not go in among them,  and they should not come in among you, for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods.” But Solʹo·mon clung to them and loved them.","And he had 700 wives who were princesses and 300 concubines, and his wives gradually inclined his heart.","In Solʹo·mon’s old age, his wives inclined  his heart to follow other gods, and his heart was not complete with  Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father.","And Solʹo·mon followed after Ashʹto·reth, the goddess of the Si·doʹni·ans, and Milʹcom, the disgusting god of the Amʹmon·ites.","And Solʹo·mon did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not follow Jehovah completely  as David his father had done.","It was then that Solʹo·mon built a high place to Cheʹmosh, the disgusting god of Moʹab, on the mountain in front of Jerusalem and to Moʹlech, the disgusting god of the Amʹmon·ites.","That was what he did for all his foreign wives who were making sacrificial smoke and sacrificing to their gods.","Jehovah became furious at Solʹo·mon, because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice","and had warned him about this very thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded.","Jehovah now said to Solʹo·mon: “Because you have done this and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes as I commanded you, I will surely  rip the kingdom away from you, and I will give it to one of your servants.","However, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it in your lifetime. I will rip it out of the hand of your son,","but I will not rip away the entire kingdom. One tribe I will give to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”","Jehovah then raised up a resister against Solʹo·mon, Haʹdad the Eʹdom·ite, of the royal family of Eʹdom.","When David defeated Eʹdom, Joʹab the chief of the army went up to bury the slain, and he tried to strike down every male in Eʹdom.","(For Joʹab and all Israel stayed there for six months until he had done away with  every male in Eʹdom.)","But Haʹdad fled with some of his father’s Eʹdom·ite servants, and they went to Egypt; Haʹdad was then a young boy.","So they set out from Midʹi·an and came to Paʹran. They took men with them from Paʹran and came to Egypt, to Pharʹaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, assigned him a food allowance, and gave him land.","Haʹdad found favor in the eyes of Pharʹaoh, so much so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Tahʹpe·nes the queen.","In time the sister of Tahʹpe·nes bore him a son, Ge·nuʹbath, and Tahʹpe·nes brought him up  in the house of Pharʹaoh, and Ge·nuʹbath remained in the house of Pharʹaoh among the sons of Pharʹaoh.","Haʹdad heard in Egypt that David had been laid to rest with his forefathers and that Joʹab the chief of the army had died. So Haʹdad said to Pharʹaoh: “Send me away, so that I may go to my own land.”","But Pharʹaoh said to him: “What have you lacked with me that you now seek to go to your own land?” To this he said: “Nothing, but please send me away.”","God also raised up against Solʹo·mon another resister, Reʹzon the son of E·liʹa·da, who had fled from his lord, Had·ad·eʹzer the king of Zoʹbah.","He gathered men to himself and became chief of a marauder band when David defeated  them. So they went to Damascus and settled there and began reigning in Damascus.","And he became a resister of Israel all the days of Solʹo·mon, adding to the harm done by Haʹdad, and he abhorred Israel while he reigned over Syria.","And there was Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat, an Eʹphra·im·ite from Zerʹe·dah, a servant of Solʹo·mon’s whose mother’s name was Ze·ruʹah, a widow. He too began to rebel  against the king.","This is why he rebelled against the king: Solʹo·mon had built the Mound  and had closed up the gap of the City of David his father.","Now this Jer·o·boʹam was a capable man. When Solʹo·mon saw that the young man was a hard worker, he made him overseer over all the compulsory service of the house of Joseph.","During that time Jer·o·boʹam went out from Jerusalem, and the prophet A·hiʹjah the Shiʹlo·nite found him on the road. A·hiʹjah was wearing a new garment, and the two of them were by themselves in the field.","A·hiʹjah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and ripped it  into 12 pieces.","Then he said to Jer·o·boʹam:","But one tribe will remain his for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.","I will do this because they have left me and are bowing down to Ashʹto·reth the goddess of the Si·doʹni·ans, to Cheʹmosh the god of Moʹab, and to Milʹcom the god of the Amʹmon·ites, and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and observing my statutes and my judgments as his father David did.","But I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, and I will keep him as a chieftain for all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, because he obeyed my commandments and my statutes.","But I will take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you, that is, ten tribes.","To his son I will give one tribe, so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself as the place to put my name.","I will take you, and you will reign over all that you desire,  and you will become king over Israel.","And if you obey all that I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my statutes and my commandments, just as David my servant did, I will also be with you. I will build you a lasting house, just as I have built for David, and I will give you Israel.","And I will humiliate the offspring of David because of this, but not always.’”","So Solʹo·mon tried to put Jer·o·boʹam to death, but Jer·o·boʹam fled to Egypt, to Shiʹshak the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until Solʹo·mon’s death.","As for the rest of the history of Solʹo·mon, all that he did and his wisdom, is it not written in the book of the history of Solʹo·mon?","The length  of Solʹo·mon’s reign in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years.","Then Solʹo·mon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David his father; and his son Re·ho·boʹam became king in his place."],["Re·ho·boʹam went to Sheʹchem, for all Israel had come to Sheʹchem to make him king.","As soon as Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat heard of it (he was still in Egypt because he had run off on account of King Solʹo·mon and was living in Egypt),","they sent for him. After that Jer·o·boʹam and all the congregation of Israel came to Re·ho·boʹam and said:","“Your father made our yoke harsh. But if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy  yoke he put on us, we will serve you.”","At this he said to them: “Go away for three days; then return to me.” So the people went away.","King Re·ho·boʹam then consulted with the older men  who had served his father Solʹo·mon while he was alive, saying: “What advice would you give on how to reply to this people?”","They answered him: “If today you would become a servant to this people and submit to their request and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”","However, he rejected the advice that the older men  gave him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants.","He asked them: “What advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me, ‘Make the yoke your father put on us lighter’?”","The young men who had grown up with him said to him: “This is what you should say to this people who have said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter for us’; this is what you should tell them, ‘My little finger will be thicker than my father’s hips.","My father imposed a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges.’”","Jer·o·boʹam and all the people came to Re·ho·boʹam on the third day, just as the king had said: “Return to me on the third day.”","But the king answered the people harshly, rejecting the advice that the older men  had given him.","He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying: “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges.”","So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was caused by Jehovah, in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through A·hiʹjah the Shiʹlo·nite to Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat.","When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people replied to the king: “What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesʹse. To your gods, O Israel. Now look after your own house, O David!” With that Israel returned to their homes.","But Re·ho·boʹam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.","Then King Re·ho·boʹam sent A·doʹram, who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Re·ho·boʹam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.","And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day.","As soon as all Israel heard that Jer·o·boʹam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None of the people followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah.","When Re·ho·boʹam arrived in Jerusalem, he immediately congregated all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 trained  warriors, to fight against the house of Israel in order to restore the kingship to Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon.","Then the word of the true God came to She·maiʹah the man of the true God, saying:","“Say to Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people,","‘This is what Jehovah says: “You must not go up and fight against your Israelite brothers. Each one of you must return to his house, for I have caused this to happen.”’” So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and went back home, as Jehovah had told them.","Jer·o·boʹam then built up  Sheʹchem in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im and lived there. From there he went out  and built up  Pe·nuʹel.","Jer·o·boʹam said in his heart: “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.","If this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices at the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, the heart of this people will also return to their lord, King Re·ho·boʹam of Judah. Yes, they will kill me and return to King Re·ho·boʹam of Judah.”","After consultation, the king made two golden calves and said to the people: “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”","Then he placed one in Bethʹel, and the other he put in Dan.","And this caused them to sin, and the people went as far as Dan to worship the one there.","And he made houses of worship on the high places and appointed priests from the people in general, those who were not Levites.","Jer·o·boʹam also established a festival in the eighth month, on the 15th day of the month, like the festival in Judah. On the altar that he made at Bethʹel, he sacrificed to the calves he had made, and at Bethʹel he assigned priests for the high places that he had made.","And he began to make offerings on the altar that he had made at Bethʹel on the 15th day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised on his own; and he established a festival for the people of Israel, and he ascended the altar to make offerings and sacrificial smoke."],["By the word of Jehovah, a man of God came from Judah to Bethʹel while Jer·o·boʹam was standing by the altar to make sacrificial smoke.","Then he called out against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said: “O altar, altar! This is what Jehovah says: ‘Look! A son named Jo·siʹah will be born to the house of David! He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places, those making sacrificial smoke on you, and he will burn human bones on you.’”","He gave a sign  on that day, saying: “This is the sign  that Jehovah has declared: Look! The altar will be ripped apart, and the ashes  that are on it will be spilled out.”","As soon as the king heard the word that the man of the true God had called out against the altar at Bethʹel, Jer·o·boʹam stretched out his hand from the altar and said: “Seize him!” Immediately, the hand that he had stretched out against him dried up,  and he could not draw it back.","Then the altar was ripped apart and the ashes were spilled out from the altar according to the sign  that the man of the true God had given by the word of Jehovah.","The king now said to the man of the true God: “Please, beg for the favor  of Jehovah your God, and pray in my behalf that my hand may be restored to me.” At this the man of the true God begged for the favor of Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored to its former condition.","The king then said to the man of the true God: “Come home with me and take some food, and let me give you a gift.”","But the man of the true God said to the king: “Even if you gave me half your house, I would not come with you and eat bread or drink water in this place.","For this is what I was commanded by  the word of Jehovah: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water, and you must not return by the way you came.’”","So he left by another way, and he did not return by the way he had come to Bethʹel.","There was a certain old prophet dwelling in Bethʹel, and his sons came home and related to him all the things that the man of the true God had done that day in Bethʹel and the words he had spoken to the king. After they related this to their father,","their father asked them: “Which way did he go?” So his sons showed him the way that the man of the true God from Judah had gone.","He now said to his sons: “Saddle the donkey for me.” They saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.","He followed the man of the true God and found him sitting under a big tree. Then he said to him: “Are you the man of the true God who came from Judah?” He replied: “I am.”","He said to him: “Come home with me and eat bread.”","But he said: “I cannot go back with you or accept your invitation, nor may I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.","For I was told by the word of Jehovah, ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there. You must not return by the way you came.’”","At this he said to him: “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel told me by the word of Jehovah, ‘Have him come back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.’” (He deceived him.)","So he went back with him to eat bread and drink water in his house.","While they were sitting at the table, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet who had brought him back,","and he called out to the man of the true God from Judah, saying, “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Because you rebelled against the order of Jehovah and did not keep the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you,","but you went back to eat bread and drink water in the place about which you were told, “Do not eat bread or drink water,” your dead body will not come into the tomb of your forefathers.’”","After the man of the true God ate bread and drank, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.","Then he got on his way, but a lion came across him on the road and killed him. His dead body was thrown onto the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion was also standing beside the dead body.","There were men passing by who saw the dead body thrown onto the road and the lion standing beside the dead body. They came in and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived.","When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard of it, he immediately said: “It is the man of the true God who rebelled against the order of Jehovah; so Jehovah gave him over to the lion, to maul and to kill him, according to the word of Jehovah that he spoke to him.”","He then said to his sons: “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it.","Then he went on his way and found the dead body thrown onto the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the dead body, nor had it mauled the donkey.","The prophet lifted up the dead body of the man of the true God and put him on the donkey, and he brought him back into his own city to mourn and bury him.","So he laid the dead body in his own tomb, and  they kept crying out over him: “Too bad, my brother!”","After burying him, he told his sons: “When I die, you must bury me in the place where the man of the true God is buried. Lay my bones next to his bones.","The word that he called out by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethʹel and against all the houses of worship on the high places in the cities of Sa·marʹi·a is sure to take place.”","Even after this happened, Jer·o·boʹam did not turn back from his bad way, but he kept appointing priests for the high places from the people in general. He would install as priests  anyone who so desired, saying: “Let him become one of the priests for the high places.”","This sin on the part of the household of Jer·o·boʹam led to their destruction and annihilation from the face of the earth."],["At that time A·biʹjah the son of Jer·o·boʹam fell sick.","So Jer·o·boʹam said to his wife: “Rise up, please, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are Jer·o·boʹam’s wife, and go to Shiʹloh. Look! A·hiʹjah the prophet is there. He is the one who spoke of me becoming king over this people.","Take with you ten loaves of bread, sprinkled cakes, and a flask of honey, and go to him. He will then tell you what is going to happen to the boy.”","Jer·o·boʹam’s wife did what he said. She rose up and went to Shiʹloh and came to the house of A·hiʹjah. A·hiʹjah’s eyes stared straight ahead, and he could not see because of his age.","But Jehovah had told A·hiʹjah: “Here is the wife of Jer·o·boʹam coming to inquire of you regarding her son, for he is sick. I will tell you what to say to her.  When she arrives, she will conceal her identity.”","As soon as A·hiʹjah heard the sound of her footsteps as she was coming into the entrance, he said: “Come in, wife of Jer·o·boʹam. Why are you concealing your identity? I have been assigned to give you a harsh message.","Go, tell Jer·o·boʹam, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: “I raised you up from among your people to make you a leader over my people Israel.","Then I ripped the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you have not become like my servant David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.","But you have done worse than all those who were prior to you, and you made for yourself another god and metal images  to offend me, and it is I whom you have turned your back on.","For that reason I am bringing calamity on the house of Jer·o·boʹam, and I will annihilate  from Jer·o·boʹam every male,  including the helpless and weak in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jer·o·boʹam, just as one clears away the dung until it is all gone!","Anyone belonging to Jer·o·boʹam who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat, for Jehovah has spoken it.”’","“Now rise up; go to your house. When you set foot in the city, the child will die.","All  Israel will mourn him and bury him, for he alone of Jer·o·boʹam’s family will be laid in a grave, because he is the only one of the house of Jer·o·boʹam in whom Jehovah the God of Israel has found something good.","Jehovah will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will do away with  the house of Jer·o·boʹam from that day forward, yes, even now.","Jehovah will strike Israel down like a reed that sways in the water, and he will uproot Israel off this good land that he gave to their forefathers, and he will scatter them beyond the River,  because they made their sacred poles,  offending Jehovah.","And he will abandon Israel because of the sins that Jer·o·boʹam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”","At that Jer·o·boʹam’s wife rose up and went on her way and came to Tirʹzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the boy died.","So they buried him, and all Israel mourned him, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken through his servant A·hiʹjah the prophet.","And the rest of the history of Jer·o·boʹam, how he waged war and how he reigned, is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel.","And the length  of Jer·o·boʹam’s reign was 22 years, after which he was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Naʹdab became king in his place.","Meanwhile, Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon had become king in Judah. Re·ho·boʹam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name. The name of Re·ho·boʹam’s mother was Naʹa·mah the Amʹmon·it·ess.","And Judah was doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and by the sins they committed they provoked him more than their forefathers had done.","They too kept building for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and sacred poles  on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.","There were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They acted according to all the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out before the Israelites.","In the fifth year of King Re·ho·boʹam, King Shiʹshak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.","He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house.  He took everything, including all the gold shields that Solʹo·mon had made.","So King Re·ho·boʹam made copper shields to replace them, and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard,  who guarded the entrance of the king’s house.","Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah, the guards would carry them, and then they would return them to the guard chamber.","And the rest of the history of Re·ho·boʹam, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah?","There was constant warfare between Re·ho·boʹam and Jer·o·boʹam.","Then Re·ho·boʹam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David.

There was also war between A·biʹjam and Jer·o·boʹam.","Then A·biʹjam was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and his son Aʹsa became king in his place.","In the 20th year of King Jer·o·boʹam of Israel, Aʹsa began to reign over Judah.","He reigned in Jerusalem for 41 years. His grandmother’s name was Maʹa·cah the granddaughter of A·bishʹa·lom.","Aʹsa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his forefather.","He expelled the male temple prostitutes from the land and removed all the disgusting idols  that his forefathers had made.","He even removed Maʹa·cah his grandmother from her position as queen mother,  because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole.  Aʹsa cut down her obscene idol and burned it in the Kidʹron Valley.","But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless, Aʹsa’s heart was complete with  Jehovah all his life.","And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of Jehovah—silver, gold, and various utensils.","There was constant warfare between Aʹsa and Baʹa·sha the king of Israel.","So King Baʹa·sha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up  Raʹmah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to  King Aʹsa of Judah.","At that Aʹsa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the house  of the king and handed them over to his servants. King Aʹsa then sent them to Ben-haʹdad the son of Tab·rimʹmon the son of Heʹzi·on, the king of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying:","“There is a treaty  between me and you and between my father and your father. I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Come, break your treaty  with King Baʹa·sha of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”","Ben-haʹdad  listened to King Aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they struck down Iʹjon, Dan, Aʹbel-beth-maʹa·cah, all Chinʹne·reth, and all the land of Naphʹta·li.","When Baʹa·sha heard of it, he immediately quit building  Raʹmah and continued dwelling in Tirʹzah.","King Aʹsa then summoned all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried off the stones and timbers of Raʹmah that Baʹa·sha had been building with, and with them King Aʹsa built up  Geʹba in Benjamin, and Mizʹpah.","As for all the rest of the history of Aʹsa, all his mightiness and all that he did and the cities that he built,  is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah?

Look! I will command a widow there to supply you with food.”","So he rose up and went to Zarʹe·phath. When he came to the entrance of the city, there was a widow gathering pieces of wood. So he called to her and said: “Please, bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink.”","As she went to get it, he called to her: “Please, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”","At this she said: “As surely as Jehovah your God is living, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar. Now I am gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go in and make something for me and my son. After we have eaten, we will die.”","Then E·liʹjah said to her: “Do not be afraid. Go in and do as you said. But first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there, and bring it out to me. Then you can make something afterward for you and your son.","For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘The large jar of flour will not run out, and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day Jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground.’”","So she went and did as E·liʹjah said, and she together with him and her household ate for many days.","The large jar of flour did not run out, and the small jar of oil did not run dry, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken through E·liʹjah.","After these things, the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick, and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing.","At this she said to E·liʹjah: “What do you have against me,  O man of the true God? Have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death?”","But he said to her: “Give me your son.” Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber, where he was staying, and he laid him on his own bed.","He called out to Jehovah: “O Jehovah my God, are you also bringing harm to the widow with whom I am staying by putting her son to death?”","Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to Jehovah: “O Jehovah my God, please, let this child’s life  come back into him.”","Jehovah listened to E·liʹjah’s request, and the life  of the child came back into him, and he revived.","E·liʹjah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother; and E·liʹjah said: “See, your son is alive.”","At that the woman said to E·liʹjah: “Now I know that you truly are a man of God and that Jehovah’s word in your mouth is truth.”"],["After some time, in the third year, Jehovah’s word came to E·liʹjah, saying: “Go, present yourself to Aʹhab, and I will send rain on the surface of the ground.”","So E·liʹjah went to present himself to Aʹhab, while the famine was severe in Sa·marʹi·a.","Meanwhile, Aʹhab called O·ba·diʹah, who was over the household. (Now O·ba·diʹah greatly feared Jehovah,","and when Jezʹe·bel was doing away with  Jehovah’s prophets, O·ba·diʹah took 100 prophets and hid them 50 to a cave, and he supplied them with bread and water.)","Aʹhab then said to O·ba·diʹah: “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys.  Perhaps we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive and not have all our animals die.”","So they divided between themselves the land they were going to pass through. Aʹhab went alone by one way, and O·ba·diʹah went alone by another way.","As O·ba·diʹah was on his way, E·liʹjah was there to meet  him. At once he recognized him and fell facedown and said: “Is this you, my lord E·liʹjah?”","He replied to him: “It is I. Go and tell your lord: ‘E·liʹjah is here.’”","But he said: “What sin have I committed that you should hand your servant over to Aʹhab to put me to death?","As surely as Jehovah your God is living, there is not a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you.

Yet, your servant has feared Jehovah from his youth.","Has my lord not been told what I did when Jezʹe·bel was killing the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid 100 of the prophets of Jehovah by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water?","But now you are saying, ‘Go and tell your lord: “E·liʹjah is here.”’ He will certainly kill me.”","However, E·liʹjah said: “As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve  is living, today I will present myself to him.”","So O·ba·diʹah went off to meet Aʹhab and told him, and Aʹhab went to meet E·liʹjah.","As soon as Aʹhab saw E·liʹjah, he said to him: “Is this you, the one bringing great trouble  on Israel?”","To this he said: “I have not brought trouble on Israel, but you and the house of your father have, by abandoning the commandments of Jehovah and by following the Baʹals.","And now summon all Israel to me at Mount Carʹmel, as well as the 450 prophets of Baʹal and the 400 prophets of the sacred pole,  who are eating at the table of Jezʹe·bel.”","So Aʹhab sent word among all the people of Israel and collected the prophets together at Mount Carʹmel.","Then E·liʹjah approached all the people and said: “How long will you be limping between two different opinions?  If Jehovah is the true God, follow him; but if Baʹal is, follow him!” But the people did not say a word in answer to him.","E·liʹjah then said to the people: “I am the only prophet of Jehovah left, while the prophets of Baʹal are 450 men.","Let them give us two young bulls, and let them choose one young bull and cut it into pieces and put it on the wood, but they should not put fire to it. I will prepare the other young bull, and I will place it on the wood, but I will not put fire to it.","Then you must call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah. The God who answers by fire will show that he is the true God.” To this all the people answered: “What you say is good.”","E·liʹjah now said to the prophets of Baʹal: “Choose one young bull and prepare it first, because you are the majority. Then call on the name of your god, but you must not put fire to it.”","So they took the young bull that was given to them, prepared it, and kept calling on the name of Baʹal from morning until noon, saying: “O Baʹal, answer us!” But there was no voice and no one answering. They kept limping around the altar  that they had made.","About noon E·liʹjah began to mock them and say: “Call out at the top of your voice! After all, he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought or he has gone to relieve himself.  Or maybe he is asleep and someone needs to wake him up!”","They were calling out at the top of their voice and cutting themselves with daggers and lances, according to their custom, until their blood gushed out all over them.","Noon was past and they continued in a frenzy  until the time the evening grain offering is presented, but there was no voice and no one answering; no one was paying attention.","At length E·liʹjah said to all the people: “Approach me.” So all the people approached him. Then he repaired the altar of Jehovah that had been torn down.","E·liʹjah then took 12 stones, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah’s word had come, saying: “Israel will be your name.”","With the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah. Then he made a trench all around the altar, an area large enough to sow with two seah measures  of seed.","After that he put the pieces of wood in order, cut the young bull into pieces, and placed it on the wood. He now said: “Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the pieces of wood.”","Then he said: “Do it again.” So they did it again. Once more he said: “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time.","And the water ran all around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.","About the time when the evening grain offering is presented, E·liʹjah the prophet stepped forward and said: “O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that it is by your word that I have done all these things.","Answer me, O Jehovah! Answer me so that this people may know that you, Jehovah, are the true God and that you are turning their hearts back to you.”","At that the fire of Jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water from the trench.","When all the people saw it, they immediately fell facedown and said: “Jehovah is the true God! Jehovah is the true God!”","Then E·liʹjah said to them: “Seize the prophets of Baʹal! Do not let a single one of them escape!” At once they seized them, and E·liʹjah brought them down to the stream  of Kiʹshon and slaughtered them there.","E·liʹjah now said to Aʹhab: “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy downpour.”","So Aʹhab went up to eat and drink, while E·liʹjah went up to the top of Carʹmel and crouched on the ground, keeping his face between his knees.","Then he said to his attendant: “Go up, please, and look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked and said: “There is nothing at all.” Seven times E·liʹjah said, “Go back.”","The seventh time his attendant said: “Look! There is a small cloud like a man’s hand ascending out of the sea.” He now said: “Go, say to Aʹhab, ‘Hitch up the chariot!  Go down so that the downpour may not detain you!’”","Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds, the wind blew, and a heavy downpour fell; and Aʹhab kept riding and made his way to Jezʹre·el.","But the hand of Jehovah came on E·liʹjah, and he wrapped his garment around  his hips and ran ahead of Aʹhab all the way to Jezʹre·el."],["Then Aʹhab told Jezʹe·bel all that E·liʹjah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.","At that Jezʹe·bel sent a messenger to E·liʹjah, saying: “So may the gods do to me and add to it if by this time tomorrow I do not make you like each one  of them!”","At that he became afraid, so he got up and ran for his life.  He came to Beʹer-sheʹba, which belongs to Judah, and he left his attendant there.","He went a day’s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree, and he asked that he  might die. He said: “It is enough! Now, O Jehovah, take my life  away, for I am no better than my forefathers.”","Then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree. But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him: “Get up and eat.”","When he looked, there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water. He ate and drank and lay down again.","Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said: “Get up and eat, for the journey will be too much for you.”","So he got up and ate and drank, and in the strength of that nourishment he went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horʹeb, the mountain of the true God.","There he entered a cave and spent the night; and look! Jehovah’s word came to him, telling him: “What are you doing here, E·liʹjah?”","To this he said: “I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life  away.”","But He said: “Go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah.” And look! Jehovah was passing by, and a great and strong wind was splitting mountains and breaking crags before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.","After the earthquake, there was a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a calm, low voice.","As soon as E·liʹjah heard it, he wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice asked him: “What are you doing here, E·liʹjah?”","To this he said: “I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life  away.”","Jehovah said to him: “Return, and go to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazʹa·el as king over Syria.","And you should anoint Jeʹhu the grandson of Nimʹshi as king over Israel, and you  should anoint E·liʹsha  the son of Shaʹphat from Aʹbel-me·hoʹlah as prophet to take your place.","Anyone escaping from Hazʹa·el’s sword, Jeʹhu will put to death; and anyone escaping from Jeʹhu’s sword, E·liʹsha will put to death.","And I still have left 7,000 in Israel, all whose knees have not bent down to Baʹal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”","So he went from there and found E·liʹsha the son of Shaʹphat while he was plowing with 12 pairs of bulls ahead of him, and he was with the 12th pair. So E·liʹjah went over to him and threw his official garment on him.","At that he left the bulls and ran after E·liʹjah and said: “Please, let me kiss my father and my mother. Then I will follow you.” He replied to him: “Go, return, for what have I done to stop you?”","So he went back and took a pair of bulls and sacrificed them, and he used the plowing gear to boil the meat of the bulls and gave it to the people, and they ate. After that he rose up and followed E·liʹjah and began to minister to him."],["Now King Ben-haʹdad of Syria gathered his whole army together along with 32 other kings and their horses and chariots; he went up and laid siege to Sa·marʹi·a and fought against it.","Then he sent messengers to King Aʹhab of Israel at the city and said to him: “This is what Ben-haʹdad says,","‘Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and your sons.’”","To this the king of Israel answered: “According to your word, my lord the king, I am yours along with all that belongs to me.”","The messengers later came back and said: “This is what Ben-haʹdad says, ‘I sent this message to you: “Your silver, your gold, your wives, and your sons you will give me.”","But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will carefully search your house and the houses of your servants, and all your desirable things they will seize and take away.’”","At that the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said: “Take note, please, and see that this man is bent on bringing calamity, for he demanded my wives, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”","Then all the elders and all the people said to him: “Do not obey, and do not consent.”","So he said to the messengers of Ben-haʹdad: “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this I cannot do.’” With that the messengers went off and brought word back to him.","Ben-haʹdad now sent him this message: “So may the gods do to me and add to it if there is enough dust in Sa·marʹi·a to give each of the people following me a handful!”","The king of Israel answered: “Tell him, ‘The one who puts on his armor should not boast about himself like one who takes it off.’”","As soon as he heard this reply, while he and the kings were drinking in their tents,  he said to his servants: “Get ready to attack!” So they got ready to attack the city.","But a prophet approached King Aʹhab of Israel and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Have you seen all this large crowd? Here I am giving it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am Jehovah.’”","Aʹhab asked: “By whom?” to  which he said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘By the attendants of the princes of the provinces.’”  So he asked: “Who will start the battle?” to which he said: “You!”","Aʹhab then counted the attendants of the princes of the provinces, and they were 232; after that, he counted all the Israelite men, 7,000.","They went out at noon while Ben-haʹdad was drinking himself drunk in the tents  along with the 32 kings who were helping him.","When the attendants of the princes of the provinces came out first, Ben-haʹdad at once sent messengers. They reported to him: “Men have come out from Sa·marʹi·a.”","At that he said: “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for battle, you should still take them alive.”","But when these came out of the city—the attendants of the princes of the provinces and the armies that were following them—","each one struck down his opponent. Then the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-haʹdad of Syria escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen.","But the king of Israel went out and kept striking down the horses and the chariots, and he inflicted a great defeat  on the Syrians.","Later the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him: “Go, strengthen yourself and consider what you are going to do, for at the start of the next year  the king of Syria will come up against you.”","Now the servants of the king of Syria said to him: “Their God is a God of mountains. That is why they overpowered us. But if we fight against them on level land, we will overpower them.","Also do this: Remove all the kings from their places, and replace them with governors.","Then gather  an army equal to the army you lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Let us fight against them on level land, and we will surely overpower them.” So he listened to their advice and did just that.","At the start of the year,  Ben-haʹdad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aʹphek for battle against Israel.","The people of Israel were also mustered and supplied, and they went out to meet them. When the people of Israel camped in front of them, they were like two tiny flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the whole land.","Then the man of the true God approached the king of Israel and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Because the Syrians have said: “Jehovah is a God of mountains, and he is not a God of plains,” I will give all this large crowd into your hand, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.’”","They remained encamped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle began. The people of Israel struck down 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day.","And the rest fled to Aʹphek, into the city. But the wall fell down on 27,000 of the men who were left. Ben-haʹdad also fled and came into the city, and he hid in an inner room.","So his servants said to him: “Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings.  Please, let us wear sackcloth on our hips  and put ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.”","So they wore sackcloth around their hips and ropes on their heads and came in to the king of Israel and said: “Your servant Ben-haʹdad says, ‘Please, let me  live.’” He replied: “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”","The men took it as an omen and quickly took him at his word, so they said: “Ben-haʹdad is your brother.” At that he said: “Go and get him.” Then Ben-haʹdad went out to him, and he had him get up into the chariot.","Ben-haʹdad now said to him: “The cities that my father took from your father I will return, and you may establish markets  for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Sa·marʹi·a.”","By the word of Jehovah, one of the sons of the prophets  said to his companion: “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him.","So he said to him: “Because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.”  After he left him, a lion came upon him and killed him.","He found another man and said: “Strike me, please.” So the man struck him and wounded him.","Then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.","As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king: “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and there was a man coming out who brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is found missing, your life will have to take the place of his life,  or else you will pay a talent  of silver.’","And while your servant was busy here and there, suddenly the man was gone.” The king of Israel said to him: “So your own judgment will be; you have decided it yourself.”","Then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.","He said to him: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Because you have let the man who I said should be destroyed escape from your hand, your life must take the place of his life,  and your people the place of his people.’”","At that the king of Israel went home to Sa·marʹi·a, sullen and dejected."],["After these things, an incident took place concerning a vineyard that belonged to Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite; it was in Jezʹre·el, next to the palace of Aʹhab the king of Sa·marʹi·a.","Aʹhab said to Naʹboth: “Give me your vineyard for me to use as a vegetable garden, for it is near my house. Then I will give you a better vineyard to replace it. Or if you prefer, I will give you its value in money.”","But Naʹboth said to Aʹhab: “It is unthinkable, from Jehovah’s standpoint, for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers.”","So Aʹhab came into his house, sullen and dejected over the answer that Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite  had given him when he said: “I will not give you the inheritance of my forefathers.” Then he lay down on his bed, kept his face turned away, and refused to eat.","His wife Jezʹe·bel came in to him and asked him: “Why are you  so sad that you refuse to eat?”","He replied to her: “Because I said to Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite, ‘Give me your vineyard for money. Or if you prefer, let me give you another vineyard to replace it.’ But he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”","His wife Jezʹe·bel said to him: “Are you not the one ruling as king over Israel? Get up, eat something, and let your heart be cheerful. I will give you the vineyard of Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite.”","So she wrote letters in Aʹhab’s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived in Naʹboth’s city.","She wrote in the letters: “Proclaim a fast, and have Naʹboth sit at the head of the people.","And have two good-for-nothing men sit in front of him and testify against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king!’ Then bring him out and stone him to death.”","So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did just as was written in the letters that Jezʹe·bel sent to them.","They proclaimed a fast and had Naʹboth sit at the head of the people.","Then two of the good-for-nothing men came in and sat down in front of him and began to testify against Naʹboth in front of the people, saying: “Naʹboth has cursed God and the king!” After that they brought him to the outskirts of the city and stoned him to death.","They now sent word to Jezʹe·bel, saying: “Naʹboth has been stoned to death.”","As soon as Jezʹe·bel heard that Naʹboth had been stoned to death, she said to Aʹhab: “Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naʹboth is no longer alive. He is dead.”","As soon as Aʹhab heard that Naʹboth was dead, Aʹhab got up to go down to the vineyard of Naʹboth the Jezʹre·el·ite to take possession of it.","But Jehovah’s word came to E·liʹjah the Tishʹbite, saying:","“Get up, go down to meet Aʹhab the king of Israel, who is in Sa·marʹi·a. There he is in the vineyard of Naʹboth, where he has gone to take possession of it.","You must tell him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Have you murdered a man and also taken his property?”’  Then say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naʹboth, the dogs will lick up your own blood.”’”","Aʹhab said to E·liʹjah: “So you have found me, O my enemy!” He replied: “I have found you. ‘Because you are determined  to do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah,","here I am bringing calamity upon you, and I will make a clean sweep after you and will annihilate from Aʹhab every male,  including the helpless and weak in Israel.","And I will make your house like the house of Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat and like the house of Baʹa·sha the son of A·hiʹjah, for you have provoked my anger and have caused Israel to sin.’","Also concerning  Jezʹe·bel, Jehovah has said: ‘The dogs will eat up Jezʹe·bel in the plot of land of Jezʹre·el.","Anyone belonging to Aʹhab who dies in the city the dogs will eat up, and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat up.","Indeed, there has never been anyone like Aʹhab, who was so determined  to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, egged on by his wife Jezʹe·bel.","He acted in the most detestable way by going after the disgusting idols,  just as all the Amʹor·ites had done, whom Jehovah drove out from before the Israelites.’”","As soon as Aʹhab heard these words, he ripped his garments apart and put sackcloth on his body; and he went on a fast and kept lying down in sackcloth and walking despondently.","Jehovah’s word then came to E·liʹjah the Tishʹbite:","“Have you seen how Aʹhab has humbled himself on my account? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the calamity during his lifetime. I will bring the calamity upon his house in the days of his son.”"],["For three years there was no war between Syria and Israel.","In the third year King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah went down to the king of Israel.","Then the king of Israel said to his servants: “Do you know that Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad belongs to us? And yet we are hesitating to take it back from the king of Syria.”","He then said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “Will you go with me to fight at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad?” Je·hoshʹa·phat replied to the king of Israel: “I am the same as you. My people are the same as your people. My horses are the same as your horses.”","But Je·hoshʹa·phat said to the king of Israel: “First inquire, please, for the word of Jehovah.”","So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about 400 men, and said to them: “Should I go to war against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, or should I refrain?” They said: “Go up, and Jehovah will give it into the king’s hand.”","Je·hoshʹa·phat then said: “Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah? Let us also inquire through him.”","At that the king of Israel said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good things concerning me, only bad. He is Mi·caiʹah the son of Imʹlah.” However, Je·hoshʹa·phat said: “The king should not say such a thing.”","So the king of Israel called a court official and said: “Bring Mi·caiʹah the son of Imʹlah quickly.”","Now the king of Israel and Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in royal attire, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sa·marʹi·a, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Then Zed·e·kiʹah the son of Che·naʹa·nah made for himself iron horns and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘With these you will gore  the Syrians until you exterminate them.’”","All the other prophets were prophesying the same way, saying: “Go up to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king’s hand.”","So the messenger who went to call Mi·caiʹah said to  him: “Look! The words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. Let your word, please, become like their words, and speak favorably.”","But Mi·caiʹah said: “As surely as Jehovah is living, whatever Jehovah says to me is what I will speak.”","Then he came in to the king, and the king asked him: “Mi·caiʹah, should we go to war against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, or should we refrain?” At once he replied: “Go up and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king’s hand.”","At that the king said to him: “How many times must I put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of Jehovah?”","So he said: “I see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. Jehovah said: ‘These have no master. Let each one go back to his house in peace.’”","Then the king of Israel said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “Did I not tell you, ‘He will not prophesy good things concerning me, only bad’?”","Mi·caiʹah then said: “Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing by him, to his right and to his left.","Jehovah then said, ‘Who will fool Aʹhab, so that he will go up and fall at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad?’ And one was saying one thing while another said something else.","Then a spirit  came forward and stood before Jehovah and said, ‘I will fool him.’ Jehovah asked him, ‘How will you do it?’","He replied, ‘I will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ So he said, ‘You will fool him, and what is more, you will be successful. Go out and do that.’","And now Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, but Jehovah has declared calamity for you.”","Zed·e·kiʹah the son of Che·naʹa·nah now approached and struck Mi·caiʹah on the cheek and said: “Which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass from me to speak with you?”","Mi·caiʹah replied: “Look! You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide.”","Then the king of Israel said: “Take Mi·caiʹah and turn him over to Aʹmon the chief of the city and to Joʹash the king’s son.","Tell them, ‘This is what the king says: “Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace.”’”","But Mi·caiʹah said: “If you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.” Then he added: “Take note, all you peoples.”","So the king of Israel and Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah went up to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad.","The king of Israel now said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “I will disguise myself and will go into the battle, but you should put on your royal attire.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and entered the battle.","Now the king of Syria had ordered his 32 chariot commanders: “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”","And as soon as the chariot commanders saw Je·hoshʹa·phat, they said to themselves: “Surely it is the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Je·hoshʹa·phat began to cry for help.","When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they immediately turned back from following him.","But one man shot his bow at random,  and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail. So the king said to his charioteer: “Turn around and take me out of the battle,  for I have been badly wounded.”","The fighting raged throughout that day, and the king had to be propped up in the chariot, facing the Syrians. The blood of the wound poured out into the interior of the war chariot, and he died in the evening.","Around sunset a cry passed through the camp, saying: “Everyone to his city! Everyone to his land!”","Thus the king died, and he was brought to Sa·marʹi·a; they buried the king in Sa·marʹi·a.","When they washed off the war chariot by the pool of Sa·marʹi·a, the dogs licked up his blood and the prostitutes bathed there,  according to the word that Jehovah had spoken.","As for the rest of the history of Aʹhab, all that he did and the house  of ivory that he built and all the cities that he built, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel?","Then Aʹhab was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son A·ha·ziʹah became king in his place.","Je·hoshʹa·phat the son of Aʹsa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of King Aʹhab of Israel.","Je·hoshʹa·phat was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was A·zuʹbah the daughter of Shilʹhi.","He kept walking in all the way of Aʹsa his father. He did not deviate from it, and he did what was right in Jehovah’s eyes. However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places.","Je·hoshʹa·phat kept peaceful relations with the king of Israel.","As for the rest of the history of Je·hoshʹa·phat, his mighty exploits and how he waged war, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah?","He also cleared out of the land the rest of the male temple prostitutes who had been left over in the days of Aʹsa his father.","Then there was no king in Eʹdom; a deputy was acting as king.","Je·hoshʹa·phat also made Tarʹshish ships  to go to Oʹphir for gold, but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at Eʹzi·on-geʹber.","It was then that A·ha·ziʹah the son of Aʹhab said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Je·hoshʹa·phat did not consent.","Then Je·hoshʹa·phat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather; and his son Je·hoʹram became king in his place.","A·ha·ziʹah the son of Aʹhab became king over Israel in Sa·marʹi·a in the 17th year of King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years.","And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes and walking in the way of his father and his mother and in the way of Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat, who had caused Israel to sin.","He continued serving Baʹal and bowing down to him and kept offending Jehovah the God of Israel, just as his father had done."]],"2 Kings":[["After the death of Aʹhab, Moʹab revolted against Israel.","It was then that A·ha·ziʹah fell down through the grating in his roof chamber in Sa·marʹi·a and was injured.

When he went up to him, he was sitting on the top of the mountain. He said to him: “Man of the true God, the king says, ‘Come down.’”","But E·liʹjah answered the chief of the 50: “Well, if I am a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men.” And fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men.","So the king sent again to him another chief of 50 with his 50 men. He went and said to him: “Man of the true God, this is what the king says, ‘Come down quickly.’”","But E·liʹjah answered them: “If I am a man of the true God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men.” And fire of God came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men.","Then the king sent again a third chief of 50 and his 50 men.

Be silent.”","E·liʹjah now said to him: “E·liʹsha, stay here, please, because Jehovah has sent me on to Jerʹi·cho.” But he said: “As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are  living, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jerʹi·cho.","Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jerʹi·cho approached E·liʹsha and said to him: “Do you know that today Jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you?” At this he said: “I already know it. Be silent.”","E·liʹjah now said to him: “Stay here, please, because Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan.” But he said: “As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are  living, I will not leave you.” So both of them went on.","And 50 of the sons of the prophets also went and stood watching from a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan.","Then E·liʹjah took his official garment and rolled it up and struck the  waters, and they were divided to the left and to the right, so that both of them went across on the dry ground.","As soon as they had gone across, E·liʹjah said to E·liʹsha: “Ask what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you.” So E·liʹsha said: “Please, may I receive a double portion  of your spirit?”","He replied: “You have asked a difficult thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will happen for you that way; but if you do not, it will not happen.”","As they were walking along, speaking as they walked, suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses made a separation between the two of them, and E·liʹjah ascended to the heavens  in the windstorm.","While E·liʹsha was watching, he was crying out: “My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and his horsemen!” When he could no longer see him, he took hold of his own garments and ripped them into two pieces.","After that he picked up the official garment of E·liʹjah that had fallen off him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.","Then he took the official garment of E·liʹjah that had fallen off him and struck the waters and said: “Where is Jehovah, the God of E·liʹjah?” When he struck the waters, they were divided to the left and to the right, so that E·liʹsha went across.","When the sons of the prophets at Jerʹi·cho saw him from a distance, they said: “The spirit of E·liʹjah has settled down on E·liʹsha.” So they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.","They said to him: “Here are 50 capable men with your servants. Let them go, please, to look for your master. Perhaps the spirit  of Jehovah has lifted him up and then thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.” But he said: “Do not send them.”","However, they kept urging him until he was embarrassed, so he said: “Send them.” They sent the 50 men, who kept looking for three days but did not find him.","When they returned to him, he was staying in Jerʹi·cho. Then he said to them: “Did I not tell you not to go?”","In time the men of the city said to E·liʹsha: “My master can see that the city is well-situated; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”","At that he said: “Bring me a small new bowl and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.","Then he went out to the source of the water and threw salt into it and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘I have healed this water. No more will it cause death or barrenness.’”","And the water has been healed down to this day, according to the word spoken by E·liʹsha.","He went up from there to Bethʹel. As he was going along the way, some young boys came out from the city and began to jeer at him, and they kept saying to him: “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”","Finally he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. Then two she-bears came out of the forest and tore 42 of the children to pieces.","He kept going from there to Mount Carʹmel, and from there he returned to Sa·marʹi·a."],["Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab became king over Israel in Sa·marʹi·a in the 18th year of King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah,  and he reigned for 12 years.","He kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, but not to the extent of his father or his mother, for he removed the sacred pillar of Baʹal that his father had made.","However, he clung to the sins that Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat had caused Israel to commit. He did not depart from them.","Now Meʹsha the king of Moʹab was a sheep raiser, and he used to pay 100,000 lambs and 100,000 unshorn rams as tribute to the king of Israel.","As soon as Aʹhab died, the king of Moʹab revolted against the king of Israel.","So King Je·hoʹram went out on that day from Sa·marʹi·a and mustered all Israel.","He also sent a message to King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah, saying: “The king of Moʹab has revolted against me. Will you go with me to war against Moʹab?” To this he said: “I will go. I am the same as you. My people are the same as your people. My horses are the same as your horses.”","Then he asked: “By which way should we go up?” He replied: “By the way of the wilderness of Eʹdom.”","The king of Israel then set out with the king of Judah and the king of Eʹdom. After they journeyed roundabout for seven days, there was no water for the camp and for the domestic animals that were following behind them.","The king of Israel said: “How terrible! Jehovah has called these three kings, only to give them into the hand of Moʹab!”","At that Je·hoshʹa·phat said: “Is there no prophet of Jehovah here through whom we may inquire of Jehovah?” So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: “There is E·liʹsha the son of Shaʹphat, who used to pour out water on the hands of E·liʹjah.”","Then Je·hoshʹa·phat said: “The word of Jehovah is with him.” So the king of Israel and Je·hoshʹa·phat and the king of Eʹdom went down to him.","E·liʹsha said to the king of Israel: “What do I have to do with you?  Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him: “No, for it is Jehovah who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moʹab.”","To this E·liʹsha said: “As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve  is living, if I did not have regard for King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah, I would not look at you or take notice of you.","Now bring me a harpist.”  As soon as the harpist started playing, the hand of Jehovah came on him.","He said, “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Dig trench after trench in this valley,","for this is what Jehovah says: “You will not see wind, and you will not see rain; yet this valley  will be filled with water, and you will drink from it, you, your livestock, and your other animals.”’","But this is a trivial thing in the eyes of Jehovah, for he will also give Moʹab into your hand.","You must strike down every fortified city and every choice city, you should cut down every good tree, you should stop up all the springs of water, and you should ruin every good plot of land with stones.”","And in the morning, at the time of the morning grain offering, water was suddenly coming from the direction of Eʹdom, and the land became filled with the water.","All the Moʹab·ites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, so they  called together all the men who could bear arms,  and they stationed themselves at the border.","When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and to the Moʹab·ites on the opposite side, the water looked red like blood.","They said: “This is blood! The kings have surely slaughtered one another with the sword. So, then, to the spoil, O Moʹab!”","When they came into the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and began striking down the Moʹab·ites, who fled from them. They advanced into Moʹab, striking the Moʹab·ites down as they went.","They tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone into every good plot of land, filling it with stones; they stopped up every spring of water, and they cut down every good tree. Finally only the stone walls of Kir-harʹe·seth remained standing, and the slingers surrounded it and struck it down.","When the king of Moʹab saw that the battle was lost, he took with him 700 men armed with swords to break through to the king of Eʹdom; but they were not able to.","So he took his firstborn son who was going to reign in his place and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. And there came to be great indignation against Israel, so they withdrew from against him and returned to their land."],["Now one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to E·liʹsha, saying: “Your servant my husband is dead, and you well know that your servant had always feared Jehovah. Now a creditor has come to take both of my children as his slaves.”","At this E·liʹsha said to her: “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She replied: “Your servant has nothing at all in the house but a jar  of oil.”","Then he said: “Go outside, ask for containers from all your neighbors, empty containers. Do not limit yourself to a few.","Then go in and close the door behind you and your sons. Fill all these containers, and set the full ones aside.”","So she left him.","When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons: “Bring another container to me.” But he said to her: “There are no more containers.” At that the oil stopped.","So she came in and told the man of the true God, and he said: “Go, sell the oil and pay off your debts, and you and your sons can live from what is left.”","One day E·liʹsha went to Shuʹnem, where there was a prominent woman, and she urged him to eat a meal there. As often as he would pass by, he would stop there to eat.","So she said to her husband: “I know that it is a holy man of God who comes this way regularly.","Please, let us make a small room on the roof and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lampstand. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.”","One day he came there, and he went to the room on the roof to lie down.","He then said to Ge·haʹzi his attendant: “Call this Shuʹnam·mite woman.” So he called her, and she stood before him.","Then he said to Ge·haʹzi: “Please tell her, ‘Here you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can be done for  you? Should I speak in your behalf to the king or to the chief of the army?’” But her reply was: “I am living among my own people.”","So he said: “Then what can be done for her?” Ge·haʹzi now said: “Well, she does not have a son, and her husband is old.”","Immediately he said: “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood at the doorway.","Then he said: “At this time next year, you will be embracing a son.” But she said: “No, my master, man of the true God! Do not tell lies to your servant.”","However, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at the same time the next year, just as E·liʹsha had told her.","The child grew up, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.","He kept saying to his father: “My head, O my head!” Then his father said to the attendant: “Carry him to his mother.”","So he carried him back to his mother, and he sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.","Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of the true God, and she shut the door behind her and left.","She now called her husband and said: “Send me, please, one of the attendants and one of the donkeys, and let me go quickly to the man of the true God and return.”","But he said: “Why are you going to see him today? It is not a new moon or a sabbath.” However, she said: “Everything is all right.”","So she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant: “Go quickly. Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.”","So she went to the man of the true God at Mount Carʹmel. As soon as the man of the true God saw her from afar, he said to Ge·haʹzi his attendant: “Look! The Shuʹnam·mite woman is over there.","Please run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you well? Is your husband well? Is your child well?’” To this she said: “All is well.”","When she came to the man of the true God at the mountain, she at once grabbed hold of his feet. At this Ge·haʹzi came near to push her away, but the man of the true God said: “Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress,  and Jehovah has hidden it from me and has not told me.”","She then said: “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, ‘You must not give me a false hope’?”","He immediately said to Ge·haʹzi: “Wrap your garments around your waist and take my staff in your hand and go. If you encounter anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone should greet you, do not answer him. Go and place my staff on the boy’s face.”","At this the boy’s mother said: “As surely as Jehovah is living and as you yourself are  living, I will not leave you.” So he got up and went with her.","Ge·haʹzi went before them and put the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. He went back to meet E·liʹsha and told him: “The boy did not wake up.”","When E·liʹsha came into the house, the boy was lying dead on his bed.","He went in and closed the door behind them both and began to pray to Jehovah.","Then he got up on the bed and lay down on the child and put his own mouth on the boy’s mouth, his own eyes on his eyes, and his own palms on his palms and kept bent over him, and the child’s body started to grow warm.","He walked back and forth in the house, and he got up on the bed and bent over him again.  The boy sneezed seven times, after which he opened his eyes.","E·liʹsha now called Ge·haʹzi and said: “Call the Shuʹnam·mite woman.” So he called her and she came in to him. Then he said: “Pick up your son.”","And she came in and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground before him, after which she picked up her son and went out.","When E·liʹsha returned to Gilʹgal, there was famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his attendant: “Put the large pot on and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”","So one of them went out to the field to pick mallows, and he found a wild vine and picked wild gourds from it, filling his garment. He then returned and sliced them into the stewpot, not knowing what they were.","They later served it to the men to eat, but as soon as they ate from the stew, they cried out: “There is death in the pot, O man of the true God.” And they could not eat it.","So he said: “Bring some flour.” After he threw it into the pot, he said: “Serve it to the people.” And nothing harmful was in the pot.","A man came from Baʹal-shalʹi·shah, and he brought the man of the true God 20 loaves of barley bread made from the first ripe fruits, as well as a bag of new grain. Then E·liʹsha said: “Give it to the people so that they may eat.”","However, his attendant said: “How can I set this before 100 men?” To this he said: “Give it to the people so that they may eat, for this is what Jehovah says, ‘They will eat and have some left over.’”","At that he put it before them, and they ate and they had some left over, according to the word of Jehovah."],["Now Naʹa·man the army chief of the king of Syria was a prominent man who was held in esteem by his lord, because through him Jehovah had given victory  to Syria. He was a mighty warrior, although he was a leper.","On one of their raids, the Syrians had taken captive from the land of Israel a little girl who became a servant to Naʹa·man’s wife.","She said to her mistress: “If only my lord would visit the prophet in Sa·marʹi·a! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.”","So he  went and reported to his lord, telling him what the girl from Israel had said.","Then the king of Syria said: “Go now! And I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he went, taking with him ten talents  of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments.","He brought to the king of Israel the letter, which read: “Along with this letter that has come to you, I send my servant Naʹa·man so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”","As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his garments apart and said: “Am I God, to put to death and to keep alive? For he is sending this man to me, telling me to cure him of his leprosy! You can see for yourselves that he is seeking a quarrel with me.”","But when E·liʹsha the man of the true God heard that the king of Israel had ripped his garments apart, he at once sent word to the king: “Why did you rip your garments apart? Please let him come to me so that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.”","So Naʹa·man came with his horses and his war chariots  and stood at the entrance of the house of E·liʹsha.","However, E·liʹsha sent a messenger to tell him: “Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”","At this Naʹa·man became indignant and started to leave, saying: “Here I said to myself, ‘He will come out to me and stand here and call on the name of Jehovah his God, moving his hand back and forth over the leprosy to cure it.’","Are not the A·baʹnah and the Pharʹpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Can I not wash in them and become clean?” With that he turned and went away in a rage.","His servants now approached him and said: “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary, would you not do it? How much more, then, since he only said to you, ‘Wash and be clean’?”","At that he went down and plunged into  the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of the true God. Then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy, and he became clean.","After that he went back to the man of the true God, he and all his entourage,  and he stood before him and said: “Now I know that there is no God anywhere in all the earth but in Israel. Now accept, please, a gift  from your servant.”","However, E·liʹsha said: “As surely as Jehovah whom I serve  is living, I will not accept it.” He urged him to accept it, but he kept refusing.","Finally Naʹa·man said: “If not, please, let your servant be given two mule-loads of soil from this land, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any gods other than Jehovah.","But may Jehovah forgive your servant for this one thing: When my lord goes into the house  of Rimʹmon to bow down there, he supports himself on my arm, so I have to bow down at the house of Rimʹmon.

When Naʹa·man saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and said: “Is everything all right?”","To this he said: “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Look! Just now two young men from the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im from the sons of the prophets came to me. Give them, please, a talent of silver and two changes of garments.’”","Naʹa·man said: “Go on, take two talents.” He kept urging him, and he wrapped up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and gave them to two of his attendants, who carried them before him.","When he reached Oʹphel,  he took them from their hand and put them in the house and sent the men away. After they left,","he went in and stood  by his master. E·liʹsha now said to him: “Where did you come from, Ge·haʹzi?” But he said: “Your servant did not go anywhere.”","E·liʹsha said to him: “Was my heart not there with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept silver or to accept garments or olive groves or vineyards or sheep or cattle or male or female servants?","Now Naʹa·man’s leprosy will stick to you and your descendants forever.” Immediately he went out from before him a leper, white as snow."],["The sons of the prophets said to E·liʹsha: “Look! The place where we are staying with you is too cramped for us.","Please let us go to the Jordan. Let each of us take a log from there and make a place there where we can dwell.” He said: “Go.”","One of them said: “Will you please come along with your servants?” At that he said: “I will come.”","So he went with them, and they came to the Jordan and began to cut down the trees.","As one of them was cutting down a tree, the axhead fell into the water, and he cried out: “Alas, my master, it was borrowed!”","The man of the true God said: “Where did it fall?” So he showed him the place. He then cut off a piece of wood and threw it there and made the axhead float.","He said: “Lift it out.” So he reached out his hand and took it.","Now the king of Syria went to war against Israel. He consulted with his servants and said: “I will encamp at such and such a place with you.”","Then the man of the true God sent word to the king of Israel, saying: “Beware of passing by this place, because that is where the Syrians are coming down.”","So the king of Israel sent word to the place that the man of the true God had warned him about. He kept warning him, and he stayed away from there on several occasions.","This enraged the king  of Syria, so he summoned his servants and said to them: “Tell me! Who among us is on the side of the king of Israel?”","Then one of his servants said: “None of us, my lord the king! It is E·liʹsha the prophet in Israel who tells the king of Israel the things that you say in your own bedroom.”","He said: “Go and find out where he is, so that I may send men to capture him.” Later the report was made to him: “He is in Doʹthan.”","He immediately sent horses and war chariots there, as well as a large army; they came by night and surrounded the city.","When the attendant  of the man of the true God rose early and went outside, he saw that an army with horses and war chariots was surrounding the city. At once the attendant said to him: “Alas, my master! What are we to do?”","But he said: “Do not be afraid! For there are more who are with us than those who are with them.”","Then E·liʹsha began to pray and say: “O Jehovah, open his eyes, please, that he may see.” Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant’s eyes and he saw, and look! the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all around E·liʹsha.","When the Syrians came down to him, E·liʹsha prayed to Jehovah and said: “Please, strike this nation with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness, just as E·liʹsha had requested.","E·liʹsha now said to them:  “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and let me lead you to the man you are looking for.” However, he led them to Sa·marʹi·a.","When they arrived in Sa·marʹi·a, E·liʹsha said: “O Jehovah, open their eyes so that they may see.” So Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw that they were in the middle of Sa·marʹi·a.","When the king of Israel saw them, he said to E·liʹsha: “Should I strike them down, should I strike them down, my father?”","But he said: “You must not strike them down. Do you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Give them bread and water so they may eat and drink and return to their lord.”","So he spread a great feast for them, and they ate and drank, after which he sent them away to return to their lord. And not once did the marauder bands of the Syrians come again into the land of Israel.","Afterward Ben-haʹdad the king of Syria gathered all his army  together and went up and besieged Sa·marʹi·a.","So there was a great famine in Sa·marʹi·a, and they besieged it until a donkey’s head was worth 80 silver pieces, and a fourth of a cab measure  of dove’s droppings was worth 5 silver pieces.","As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him: “Help us, O my lord the king!”","To this he said: “If Jehovah does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? Or from the wine or oil press?”","The king asked her: “What is the matter with you?” She replied: “This woman said to me, ‘Hand over your son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’","So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, ‘Hand over your son so that we may eat him.’ But she hid her son.”","As soon as the king heard the woman’s words, he ripped his garments apart. When he passed by on the wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.","Then he said: “So may God do to me and add to it if the head of E·liʹsha the son of Shaʹphat remains on him today!”","E·liʹsha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger arrived, E·liʹsha said to the elders: “Have you seen how this son of a murderer has sent to take off my head? Watch when the messenger comes, close the door, and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his lord’s footsteps behind him?”","While he was still speaking with them, the messenger came to him, and the king said: “This calamity is from Jehovah. Why should I wait any longer for Jehovah?”"],["E·liʹsha now said, “Listen to the word of Jehovah. This is what Jehovah says: ‘Tomorrow about this time at the gate  of Sa·marʹi·a, a seah measure  of fine flour will be worth a shekel,  and two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel.’”","At that the adjutant whom the king relied on said to the man of the true God: “Even if Jehovah  should open floodgates in the heavens, could this  possibly take place?” To that he said: “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat from it.”","There were four lepers at the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another: “Why are we sitting here until we die?","If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ while the famine is in the city, we would die there. And if we sit here, we will die anyway. So now let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives, we will live, but if they put us to death, then we will die.”","They then got up in the evening darkness and entered the camp of the Syrians. When they reached the outskirts of the Syrian camp, there was nobody there.","For Jehovah had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of war chariots and horses, the sound of a huge army. So they said to one another: “Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hitʹtites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!”","They immediately got up and fled in the evening darkness, leaving their tents, horses, donkeys, and the whole camp just as it was, and they fled for their lives.","When these lepers reached the outskirts of the camp, they entered into one of the tents and began to eat and drink. They carried away from there silver, gold, and garments and went and hid them. Then they returned and entered another tent and carried things away from there and went and hid them.","Finally they said to one another: “What we are doing is not right. This day is a day of good news! If we hesitate and wait until dawn, we will deserve to be punished. Let us now go and report this at the king’s house.”","So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city and reported to them: “We went into the camp of the Syrians, but nobody was there—we did not hear anyone at all. There were only the horses and donkeys tied and the tents left just as they were.”","At once the gatekeepers called out, and it was reported inside the king’s house.","Immediately the king got up by night and said to his servants: “Please let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry, so they left the camp to hide in the field, saying, ‘They will come out of the city, and we will catch them alive and enter into the city.’”","Then one of his servants said: “Please, let some men take five of the remaining horses that are in the city. Look! They will end up the same as all the crowd of Israel that remain here. Look! They will end up the same as all the crowd of Israel that perished. Let us then send them out and see.”","So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them out to the camp of the Syrians, saying: “Go and see.”","They followed them as far as the Jordan, and the entire way was covered with garments and utensils that the Syrians had thrown away as they fled in panic. The messengers returned and reported it to the king.","The people then went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians, so that a seah measure of fine flour came to be worth a shekel, and two seah measures of barley came to be worth a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.","The king had appointed the adjutant whom he relied on to be in charge of the  gate, but the people trampled him to death at the gate, just as the man of the true God had told the king when he came down to him.","It happened just as the man of the true God had said to the king: “Two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel, and a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel tomorrow at this time at the gate of Sa·marʹi·a.”","But the adjutant had said to the man of the true God: “Even if Jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens, could such a thing  take place?” To this E·liʹsha had said: “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat from it.”","That is exactly what happened to him, because the people trampled him to death at the gate."],["E·liʹsha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life:  “Rise up and go, you with your household, and live as a foreigner wherever you can, for Jehovah has declared a famine, and it will come on the land for seven years.”","So the woman got up and did what the man of the true God said. She went with her household and settled in the land of the Phi·lisʹtines for seven years.","At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Phi·lisʹtines and went to appeal to the king for her house and her field.","Now the king was speaking to Ge·haʹzi the attendant of the man of the true God, saying: “Relate to me, please, all the great things that E·liʹsha has done.”","Just as he was relating to the king how he had restored the dead one to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life came to the king, appealing for her house and her field.

Then the king assigned her a court official, telling him: “Return all that belongs to her and all the products of the field from the day she left the land until now.”","E·liʹsha came to Damascus when Ben-haʹdad the king of Syria was sick. So the report was made to him: “The man of the true God has come here.”","At that the king said to Hazʹa·el: “Take a gift with you and go and meet the man of the true God. Inquire of Jehovah through him, asking, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”","Hazʹa·el went to meet him and took a gift with him, every sort of good thing of Damascus, the load of 40 camels.

Then the man of the true God gave way to weeping.","Hazʹa·el asked: “Why is my lord weeping?” He replied: “Because I know what harm you will do to the people of Israel. Their fortified places you will set on fire, their choice men you will kill with the sword, their children you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip open.”","Hazʹa·el said: “How could your servant, who is a mere dog, do such a deed?” But E·liʹsha said: “Jehovah has shown me that you will be king over Syria.”","Then he left E·liʹsha and returned to his own lord, who said to him: “What did E·liʹsha say to you?” He replied: “He told me that you will certainly recover.”","But the next day, Hazʹa·el took a coverlet, dipped it in water, and held  it over his face until he died.

Why did this crazy man come to you?” He answered them: “You know that sort of man and his sort of talk.”","But they said: “That is not true!

Who?” Immediately two or three court officials looked down at him.","He said: “Throw her down!” So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her.","After that he went in and ate and drank.

After all, she is the daughter of a king.”","But when they went to bury her, they did not find anything but her skull and her feet and the palms of her hands.","When they returned and told him, he said: “This fulfills the word of Jehovah that he spoke through his servant E·liʹjah the Tishʹbite, saying, ‘In the plot of land of Jezʹre·el, the dogs will eat the flesh of Jezʹe·bel.","And the dead body of Jezʹe·bel will become as manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land of Jezʹre·el, so that they may not say: “This is Jezʹe·bel.”’”"],["Now Aʹhab had 70 sons in Sa·marʹi·a.

If two kings could not stand before him, how can we stand?”","So the overseer of the palace,  the governor of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent this message to Jeʹhu: “We are your servants, and we will do everything that you tell us.

Yes, I conspired against my lord, and I killed him, but who struck down all of these?","Know, then, that not a single word of Jehovah’s that Jehovah has spoken against the house of Aʹhab will go unfulfilled,  and Jehovah has done what he spoke through his servant E·liʹjah.”","Moreover, Jeʹhu struck down all who were left of the house of Aʹhab in Jezʹre·el, as well as all his distinguished men, his acquaintances, and his priests, until he had left him no survivor.","Then he got up and went on his way to Sa·marʹi·a. The binding house  of the shepherds was on the way.","There Jeʹhu encountered the brothers of King A·ha·ziʹah of Judah, and he said to them, “Who are you?” They said: “We are the brothers of A·ha·ziʹah, and we are on our way down to ask if all is well with the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”","Immediately he said: “Capture them alive!” So they captured them alive and slaughtered them at the cistern of the binding house, 42 men.

When he greeted  him, he said to him: “Is your heart fully  with me, just as my heart is with your heart?”","Then he said: “Come along with me, and see my toleration of no rivalry toward  Jehovah.” So they had him ride with him in his war chariot.","Then he came to Sa·marʹi·a, and he struck down all who were left over of Aʹhab’s house in Sa·marʹi·a until he had annihilated them, according to  Jehovah’s word that he had spoken to E·liʹjah.","Further, Jeʹhu collected all the people together and said to them: “Aʹhab worshipped Baʹal a little, but Jeʹhu will worship him much more.","So summon all the prophets of Baʹal, all his worshippers, and all his priests to me. Do not let a single one be absent, because I have a great sacrifice for Baʹal. Anyone who is absent will not live.” But Jeʹhu was acting with cunning to destroy the worshippers of Baʹal.","Jeʹhu continued: “Declare  a solemn assembly for Baʹal.” So they proclaimed it.","After that Jeʹhu sent word throughout Israel, and all the worshippers of Baʹal came. Not a single one was left out who did not come. They entered the house  of Baʹal, and the house of Baʹal was filled from end to end.","He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe: “Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baʹal.” So he brought out the clothing for them.","Then Jeʹhu and Je·honʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab went into the house of Baʹal. He now said to the worshippers of Baʹal: “Search carefully and see that there are no worshippers of Jehovah here, only worshippers of Baʹal.”","Finally they came in to offer up sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jeʹhu had stationed 80 of his men outside and said: “If any one of the men I am putting into your hands escapes, it will be your life for his.”","As soon as he finished offering up the burnt offering, Jeʹhu said to the guards  and the adjutants: “Come in and strike them down! Do not let a single one escape!” So the guards and the adjutants struck them down with the sword and threw them out, and they kept going as far as the inner sanctuary  of the house of Baʹal.","Then they brought out the sacred pillars of the house of Baʹal and burned each one.","They tore down the sacred pillar of Baʹal, and they tore down the house of Baʹal and turned it into latrines, as it remains to this day.","Thus Jeʹhu annihilated Baʹal out of Israel.","However, Jeʹhu did not turn away from the sins that Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat had caused Israel to commit as regards the golden calves that were in Bethʹel and in Dan.","So Jehovah said to Jeʹhu: “Because you have acted well and have done what is right in my eyes by carrying out all that was in my heart to do to the house of Aʹhab, four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”","But Jeʹhu did not take care to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins that Jer·o·boʹam had caused Israel to commit.","In those days Jehovah started to cut off  Israel piece by piece. Hazʹa·el kept attacking them throughout the territory of Israel,","from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilʹe·ad—of the Gadʹites, the Reuʹben·ites, and the Ma·nasʹsites—from A·roʹer, which is by the Arʹnon Valley,  to Gilʹe·ad and Baʹshan.","And the rest of the history of Jeʹhu, all that he did and all his mightiness, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel?","Then Jeʹhu was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in Sa·marʹi·a; and his son Je·hoʹa·haz became king in his place.","The length  of Jeʹhu’s reign over Israel was 28 years in Sa·marʹi·a."],["Now when Ath·a·liʹah, A·ha·ziʹah’s mother, saw that her son had died, she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line.","However, Je·hoshʹe·ba the daughter of King Je·hoʹram, A·ha·ziʹah’s sister, took Je·hoʹash the son of A·ha·ziʹah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death, keeping him and his nurse in an inner bedroom. They managed to keep him concealed from Ath·a·liʹah, so he was not put to death.","He remained with her for six years, hidden at the house of Jehovah, while Ath·a·liʹah was ruling over the land.","In the seventh year, Je·hoiʹa·da sent for the chiefs of hundreds of the Caʹri·an bodyguard and of the palace guards  and had them come to him at the house of Jehovah. He made a pact  with them and had them swear to it at the house of Jehovah, and then he showed them the son of the king.","He ordered them: “This is what you are to do: One third of you will be on duty on the Sabbath and will keep strict watch over the king’s house,","another third will be at the Gate of the Foundation, and another third will be at the gate behind the palace guards. You will take turns watching over the house.","Your two divisions that are supposed to be off duty on the Sabbath must keep strict watch over the house of Jehovah to protect the king.","You must surround the king on every side, each with his weapons in hand. Anyone entering within the ranks will be put to death. Stay with the king wherever he goes.”","The chiefs of hundreds did exactly what Je·hoiʹa·da the priest had commanded. So each one took his men who were on duty on the Sabbath, together with those who were off duty on the Sabbath, and they came in to Je·hoiʹa·da the priest.","The priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the circular shields that had belonged to King David, which were in the house of Jehovah.","And the palace guards took their positions, each with his weapons in hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, all around the king.","Then Je·hoiʹa·da brought the king’s son out and put on him the crown  and the Testimony,  and they made him king and anointed him. They began to clap their hands and say: “Long live the king!”","When Ath·a·liʹah heard the sound of the people running, she immediately came to the people at the house of Jehovah.","Then she saw the king standing there by the pillar according to the custom. The chiefs and the trumpeters were with the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets. At this Ath·a·liʹah ripped her garments apart and cried out: “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!”","But Je·hoiʹa·da the priest commanded the chiefs of  hundreds, those appointed over the army, and said to them: “Take her out from among the ranks, and if anyone follows her, put him to death with the sword!” For the priest had said: “Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.”","So they seized her, and when she reached the place where the horses enter the king’s house,  she was put to death there.","Then Je·hoiʹa·da made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they would continue as the people of Jehovah, and he also made a covenant between the king and the people.","After that all the people of the land came to the house  of Baʹal and tore down his altars, completely smashed his images, and killed Matʹtan the priest of Baʹal in front of the altars.","Further, he took the chiefs of hundreds, the Caʹri·an bodyguard, the palace guards, and all the people of the land to escort the king down from the house of Jehovah, and they came to the king’s house  by the way of the gate of the palace guard.

After that Joʹab came to Jerusalem.","When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Syrians in the region of the River,  with Shoʹphach the chief of the army of Had·ad·eʹzer leading them.","When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up in battle formation against them. David drew up in battle formation to meet the Syrians, and they fought against him.","But the Syrians fled from Israel; and David killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers of the Syrians, and he put Shoʹphach the chief of the army to death.","When the servants of Had·ad·eʹzer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they promptly made peace with David and became his subjects; and Syria did not want to help the Amʹmon·ites anymore."],["At the start of the year,  at the time when kings go on campaigns, Joʹab led a military expedition and devastated the land of the Amʹmon·ites; he came and besieged Rabʹbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joʹab attacked Rabʹbah and tore it down.","Then David took the crown of Malʹcam from its head, and found that it weighed a talent  of gold, and in it there were precious stones; and it was placed on David’s head. He also took a vast amount of spoil from the city.","And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones and at working with sharp iron instruments and with axes. That was what David did to all the cities of the Amʹmon·ites. Finally David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.","After this, war broke out at Geʹzer with the Phi·lisʹtines. At that time Sibʹbe·cai the Huʹshath·ite struck down Sipʹpai, who was a descendant of the Rephʹa·im, and they were subdued.","And there was war again with the Phi·lisʹtines, and El·haʹnan the son of Jaʹir struck down Lahʹmi the brother of Go·liʹath the Gitʹtite, whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers.","War broke out yet again at Gath, where there was a man of extraordinary size, with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot, 24 in all; and he too was a descendant of the Rephʹa·im.","He kept taunting Israel. So Jonʹa·than the son of Shimʹe·a, David’s brother, struck him down.","These were descendants of the Rephʹa·im in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."],["Then Satan  stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel.","So David said to Joʹab and the chiefs of the people: “Go, count Israel from Beʹer-sheʹba to Dan; then report to me so that I may know their number.”","But Joʹab said: “May Jehovah multiply his people 100 times! My lord the king, are not all of them already servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?”","But the king’s word prevailed over Joʹab. So Joʹab went out and traveled throughout Israel, after which he came to Jerusalem.","Joʹab now gave to David the number of the people who were registered. All Israel amounted to 1,100,000 men armed with swords, and Judah, 470,000 men armed with swords.","But Leʹvi and Benjamin were not registered among them, because the king’s word was detestable to Joʹab.","Now this was very displeasing to the true God, so he struck Israel.","David then said to the true God: “I have sinned greatly by doing this. And now, please, forgive your servant’s error, for I have acted very foolishly.”","Jehovah then spoke to Gad, David’s visionary, saying:","“Go and say to David, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “I am giving you three options. Choose the one that I should bring on you.”’”","So Gad came in to David and said to him: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘Take your pick","whether there should be three years of famine, or three months of being swept away by your adversaries while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of Jehovah—pestilence in the land—with Jehovah’s angel bringing destruction in all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what I should reply to the One who sent me.”","So David said to Gad: “It is very distressing to me. Please, let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”","Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel, so that 70,000 people out of Israel fell.","Moreover, the true God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to do so, Jehovah saw it and felt regret  over the calamity, and he said to the angel bringing destruction: “It is enough! Now let your hand drop.” Jehovah’s angel was standing close to the threshing floor of Orʹnan the Jebʹu·site.","When David raised his eyes, he saw Jehovah’s angel  standing between the earth and the heavens with a drawn sword in his hand extended toward Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, at once threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.","David said to the true God: “Was it not I who said to number the people? I am the one who sinned, and I am the one who did wrong; but these sheep—what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let your hand, please, come against me and my father’s house; but do not bring this scourge on your people.”","Jehovah’s angel then told Gad to tell David to go up and erect an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Orʹnan the Jebʹu·site.","So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.","Meanwhile, Orʹnan turned around and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Orʹnan had been threshing wheat.","When David came up to him, Orʹnan looked and saw David, and he immediately went out from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the ground.","David said to Orʹnan: “Sell  me the site of the threshing floor, so that I may build an altar to Jehovah on it. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the scourge against the people may be halted.”","But Orʹnan said to David: “Take it as your own, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him.  Here, I am providing the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering. I give all of it.”","However, King David said to Orʹnan: “No, I must buy it for the full price, because I will not take what is yours and give it to Jehovah or offer up burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.”","So David gave Orʹnan 600 gold shekels  by weight for the site.","And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices, and he called on Jehovah, who now answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of burnt offering.","Then Jehovah ordered the angel to return his sword to its sheath.","At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Orʹnan the Jebʹu·site, he continued to sacrifice there.","However, the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibʹe·on.","But David had not been able to go before it to consult God, for he was terrified because of the sword of Jehovah’s angel."],["David then said: “This is the house of Jehovah the true God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.”","David then gave orders to bring together the foreign residents who were in the land of Israel, and he assigned them to be stonecutters to cut and shape stones for building the house of the true God.","David also prepared iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, and so much copper that it was beyond weighing,","and also cedar timbers without number, for the Si·doʹni·ans and the Tyrʹi·ans brought great quantities of cedar timbers to David.","And David said: “My son Solʹo·mon is  young and inexperienced,  and the house to be built for Jehovah is to be exceedingly magnificent, so that its fame and beauty will be known in all lands. Therefore, I will make preparation for him.” So David prepared materials in great quantity before his death.","Moreover, he summoned his son Solʹo·mon and instructed him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.","David told his son Solʹo·mon: “As for me, it was my heart’s desire to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God.","But Jehovah’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed a great deal of blood, and you have fought great wars. You will not build a house for my name, for you have shed a great deal of blood on the earth before me.","Look! You will have a son who will be a man of peace,  and I will give him rest from all his enemies who surround him, for Solʹo·mon  will be his name and I will grant Israel peace and quiet in his days.","He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will become my son, and I will be his father. I will firmly establish the throne of his kingship over Israel forever.’","“Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you, and may you be successful and build the house of Jehovah your God, just as he has spoken concerning you.","Only may Jehovah give you discretion and understanding when he gives you authority over Israel, so that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God.","Then you will be successful if you carefully observe the regulations and the judgments that Jehovah ordered Moses to give Israel. Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or be terrified.","Here I have taken great pains to prepare for Jehovah’s house 100,000 talents  of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver and such great quantities of copper and iron that they cannot be weighed, and I have prepared timbers and stones, but you will add to them.","A great number of workmen are with you—stonecutters, stonemasons, woodworkers, and all kinds of skilled workers.","The gold, silver, copper, and iron are beyond measure. Get up and begin the work, and may Jehovah be with you.”","David then ordered all the princes of Israel to help his son Solʹo·mon:","“Is not Jehovah your God with you, and has he not given you rest on every side? For he handed over to me the inhabitants of the land, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before his people.","Now determine with all your heart and soul  to seek Jehovah your God, and start building the sanctuary of Jehovah the true God, in order to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy utensils of the true God to the house built for the name of Jehovah.”"],["When David had grown old and was near the end of his life,  he made his son Solʹo·mon king over Israel.","He then gathered all the princes of Israel, the priests, and the Levites.","The Levites who were 30 years old and up were numbered; their number, their head count man by man, was 38,000.","Of these, 24,000  served as supervisors over the work of Jehovah’s house, and there were 6,000 officers and judges,","and there were 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 gave praise to Jehovah on the instruments about which David said, “I made them for giving praise.”","Then David organized  them into divisions according to the sons of Leʹvi: Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi.","Of the Gerʹshon·ites were Laʹdan and Shimʹe·i.","The sons of Laʹdan were Je·hiʹel the headman, Zeʹtham, and Joel, three.","The sons of Shimʹe·i were She·loʹmoth, Haʹzi·el, and Haʹran, three.

These four were the sons of Shimʹe·i.","Jaʹhath was the head and Ziʹzah, the second. But since Jeʹush and Be·riʹah did not have many sons, they were counted as one paternal house with one area of responsibility.","The sons of Koʹhath were Amʹram, Izʹhar, Hebʹron, and Uzʹzi·el, four.","The sons of Amʹram were Aaron and Moses. But Aaron was permanently set apart to sanctify the Most Holy, he and his sons, to offer sacrifices before Jehovah, to minister to him, and to pronounce blessings in his name always.","As for Moses the man of the true God, his sons were named among the tribe of the Levites.","The sons of Moses were Gerʹshom and E·li·eʹzer.","Of the sons of Gerʹshom, Shebʹu·el was the head.","Of the descendants  of E·li·eʹzer, Re·ha·biʹah was the head; E·li·eʹzer did not have other sons, but the sons of Re·ha·biʹah were very many.","Of the sons of Izʹhar, She·loʹmith was the headman.","The sons of Hebʹron were Je·riʹah the head, Am·a·riʹah the second, Ja·ha·ziʹel the third, and Jek·a·meʹam the fourth.","The sons of Uzʹzi·el were Miʹcah the head and Is·shiʹah the second.","The sons of Me·rarʹi were Mahʹli and Muʹshi. The sons of Mahʹli were El·e·aʹzar and Kish.","El·e·aʹzar died, but he had no sons, only daughters.

He covered it with 600 talents  of fine gold.","The weight of the gold for the nails was 50 shekels;  and he covered the roof chambers with gold.","Then he made in the Most Holy compartment  two cherub sculptures, and he overlaid them with gold.","The overall length of the wings of the cherubs was 20 cubits; one wing of the first cherub was  five cubits long and touched the wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the other cherub’s wings.","And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits long and touched the other wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the first cherub’s wings.","The wings of these cherubs were spread out 20 cubits; and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward.","He also made the curtain of blue thread, purple wool, crimson, and fine fabric, and incorporated cherub designs into it.","Then he made two pillars at the front of the house, 35 cubits in length, and the capital on top of each pillar was five cubits.","And he made chains, like necklaces, and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made 100 pomegranates and put them on the chains.","He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one to the right  and one to the left;  he named the one on the right Jaʹchin  and the one on the left Boʹaz."],["Then he made the copper altar, 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high.","He made the Sea  of cast metal.

The gourds were in two rows and were cast in one piece with it.","It stood on 12 bulls, 3 facing north, 3 facing west, 3 facing south, and 3 facing east; and the Sea rested on them, and all their hindquarters were toward the center.","And its thickness was a handbreadth;  and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. The reservoir could hold  3,000 bath measures.","Further, he made ten basins for washing and put five to the right and five to the left. They would rinse in them the things used for the burnt offering.

The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built!","Now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you.","May your eyes be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where you said that you would put your name, to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.","And listen to your servant’s pleas for help and to the pleas of your people Israel when they pray toward this place, and may you hear from your dwelling place, from the heavens; yes, may you hear and forgive.","“If a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath  and is brought under liability to the oath,  and while under the oath  he comes before your altar in this house,","may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by paying back the wicked one and bringing what he did on his own head and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent  and rewarding him according to his own righteousness.","“And if your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you, and they return and glorify your name and pray and beg for favor before you in this house,","may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their forefathers.","“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you, and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled  them,","may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants, of your people Israel, for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.","“If a famine occurs in the land, or a pestilence, a scorching blight, mildew, swarming locusts, or voracious locusts  or if their enemies besiege them in any of the cities of the land  or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs,","whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel (for each one knows his own plague and his own pain) when they spread out their hands toward this house,","then may you hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and may you forgive; and reward each one according to all his ways, for you know his heart (you alone truly know the human heart),","so that they may fear you by walking in your ways all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers.","“Also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes  from a distant land because of your great name  and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, and he comes and prays toward this house,","may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.","“If your people go to war against their enemies in the way that you send them and they pray to you in the direction of this city that you have chosen and toward the house that I have built for your name,","then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them.","“If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy, and their captors carry them off captive to a land, far or near,","and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive, and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land where they are captives, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’","and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul  in the land of their captivity where they were carried off captive, and they pray in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,","then hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, their prayer and their request for favor, and execute judgment for them and forgive your people who have sinned against you.","“Now, O my God, please, may your eyes be opened and your ears attentive to the prayer offered in  this place.","And now go up, O Jehovah God, to your resting-place, you and the Ark of your strength. Let your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let your loyal ones rejoice in your goodness.","O Jehovah God, do not reject  your anointed one. May you remember your loyal love to David your servant.”"],["Now as soon as Solʹo·mon had finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and Jehovah’s glory filled the house.","The priests were unable to enter the house of Jehovah because Jehovah’s glory had filled the house of Jehovah.","And all the people of Israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house, and they bowed low with their faces to the ground on the pavement and prostrated themselves and thanked Jehovah, “for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.”","Now the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah.","King Solʹo·mon offered the sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people inaugurated the house of the true God.","The priests were standing at their posts of duty, as were the Levites who had the instruments used to accompany the song to Jehovah. (King David had made  these instruments for giving thanks to Jehovah—“for his loyal love endures forever”—when David would offer praise with them. ) And the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets in front of them, while all the Israelites were standing.","Then Solʹo·mon sanctified the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Jehovah, for there he had to offer up the burnt offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, because the copper altar that Solʹo·mon had made could not contain the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces.","At that time Solʹo·mon held the festival for seven days together with all Israel, a very great congregation from Leʹbo-haʹmath  down to the Wadi  of Egypt.","But on the eighth day  they held a solemn assembly, because they had held the inauguration of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days.","Then on the 23rd day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David and Solʹo·mon and Israel his people.","Thus Solʹo·mon finished the house of Jehovah and the house  of the king; and everything that came into Solʹo·mon’s heart to do regarding the house of Jehovah and his own house he accomplished successfully.","Jehovah then appeared to Solʹo·mon during the night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.","When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain and when I command the grasshoppers to devour the land and if I send a pestilence among my people,","if my people on whom my name has been called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn away from their evil ways, then I will hear from the heavens and forgive their sin and heal their land.","Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer at this place.","And now I have chosen and sanctified this house so that my name may be there permanently, and my eyes and my heart will always be there.","“And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked by doing everything I have commanded you, and you obey my regulations and my judgments,","then I will establish the throne of your kingship, just as I made a covenant with your father David, saying, ‘There will never fail to be a man of your line ruling over Israel.’","But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have put before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them,","I will uproot Israel from my land that I have given them, and this house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it an object of scorn  and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples.","And this house will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will say, ‘Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house?’","Then they will say, ‘It was because they abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers, who had brought them out of the land  of Egypt, and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. That is why he brought all this calamity on them.’”"],["At the end of 20 years, during which Solʹo·mon built the house of Jehovah and his own house,","Solʹo·mon rebuilt the cities that Hiʹram had given Solʹo·mon and settled Israelites  there.","Furthermore, Solʹo·mon went to Haʹmath-zoʹbah and captured it.","Then he built up  Tadʹmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in Haʹmath.","He also built up Upper Beth-hoʹron and Lower Beth-hoʹron, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,","and Baʹal·ath as well as all of Solʹo·mon’s storage cities, all the chariot cities, the cities for the horsemen, and whatever Solʹo·mon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebʹa·non, and in all the land of his dominion.","As for all the people who were left from the Hitʹtites, the Amʹor·ites, the Perʹiz·zites, the Hiʹvites, and the Jebʹu·sites, who were not part of Israel,","their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had not exterminated—were conscripted by Solʹo·mon for forced labor until this day.","But Solʹo·mon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his work, for they were his warriors, the chiefs of his adjutants, and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen.","There were 250 chiefs of the deputies of King Solʹo·mon, the foremen over the people.","Solʹo·mon also brought Pharʹaoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said: “Although she is my wife, she should not dwell in the house of King David of Israel, for the places to which the Ark of Jehovah has come are holy.”","Then Solʹo·mon offered up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he had built in front of the porch.","He followed the daily routine and made offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals three times in the year—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths.","Further, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their services according to the rule of his father David, and the Levites for their posts of duty, to praise and to minister in the presence of the priests according to the daily routine, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates, for such was the commandment of David, the man of the true God.","And they did not deviate from the king’s commandment to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the storehouses.","So Solʹo·mon’s work was all well-organized,  from the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.","It was then that Solʹo·mon went to Eʹzi·on-geʹber and to Eʹloth on the seashore in the land of Eʹdom.","Hiʹram sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants. They went with Solʹo·mon’s servants to Oʹphir and took from there 450 talents  of  gold and brought it to King Solʹo·mon."],["Now the queen of Sheʹba heard the report about Solʹo·mon, so she came to Jerusalem to test Solʹo·mon with perplexing questions.  She was accompanied by a very impressive entourage,  with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones. She went in to Solʹo·mon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart.","Solʹo·mon then answered all her questions. There was nothing too difficult for  Solʹo·mon to explain to her.","When the queen of Sheʹba had seen Solʹo·mon’s wisdom, the house that he built,","the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the table service of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, she was left completely breathless.","So she said to the king: “The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements  and about your wisdom was true.","But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes. And look! I had not been told the half of your great wisdom. You have far surpassed the report that I heard.","Happy are your men, and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly, listening to your wisdom!","May Jehovah your God be praised, who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on his throne as king for Jehovah your God. Because your God loves Israel, in order to make it continue forever, he appointed you over it as king to administer justice and righteousness.”","Then she gave the king 120 talents  of gold and a great quantity of balsam oil and precious stones. Never again was such balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheʹba gave to King Solʹo·mon.","Moreover, the servants of Hiʹram and the servants of Solʹo·mon who brought gold from Oʹphir also brought algum timbers and precious stones.","The king made from the algum timbers stairs for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house,  as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers. Nothing like them had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.","King Solʹo·mon also gave the queen of Sheʹba whatever she desired and asked for, more than  what she had brought to the king. Then she left and returned to her own land, together with her servants.","And the weight of the gold that came to Solʹo·mon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold,","besides that brought in by the merchants and the traders and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land who were bringing gold and silver in to Solʹo·mon.","King Solʹo·mon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold (600 shekels  of alloyed gold went on each shield)","and 300 bucklers  of alloyed gold (three miʹnas  of gold went on each  buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebʹa·non.","The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.","There were six steps to the throne, and there was a gold footstool attached to the throne, and there were armrests on both sides of the seat, and two lions were standing beside the armrests.","And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps, one at each end of the six steps. No other kingdom had made anything like it.","All the drinking vessels of King Solʹo·mon were of gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebʹa·non were of pure gold. There was nothing made of silver, for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solʹo·mon.","For the king’s ships would go to Tarʹshish with the servants of Hiʹram. Once every three years, the ships of Tarʹshish would come loaded with gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.","So King Solʹo·mon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.","And the kings of all the earth sought an audience with  Solʹo·mon to hear his wisdom that the true God had put in his heart.","They would each bring a gift—articles of silver, articles of gold, garments, armor, balsam oil, horses, and mules—and this continued year after year.","And Solʹo·mon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots and 12,000 horses,  and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem.","And he ruled over all the kings from the River  to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines and to the boundary of Egypt.","The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the She·pheʹlah.","And they would bring horses to Solʹo·mon from Egypt and from all the other lands.","As for the rest of the history of Solʹo·mon, from beginning to end, is it not written among the words of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of A·hiʹjah the Shiʹlo·nite, and in the record of visions of Idʹdo the visionary concerning Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat?","Solʹo·mon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years.","Then Solʹo·mon was laid to rest with his forefathers. So they buried him in the City of David his father; and his son Re·ho·boʹam became king in his place."],["Re·ho·boʹam went to Sheʹchem, for all Israel had come to Sheʹchem to make him king.","As soon as Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat heard of it (he was still in Egypt because he had fled on account of King Solʹo·mon), Jer·o·boʹam came back from Egypt.","Then they sent for him, and Jer·o·boʹam and all Israel came to Re·ho·boʹam and said:","“Your father made our yoke harsh. But if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy  yoke he put on us, we will serve you.”","At this he said to them: “Return to me after three days.” So the people went away.","King Re·ho·boʹam then consulted with the older men  who had served his father Solʹo·mon while he was alive, saying: “What advice would you give on how to reply to this people?”","They answered him: “If you are good to this people  and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.”","However, he rejected the advice that the older men  gave him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants.","He asked them: “What advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me, ‘Make the yoke your father put on us lighter’?”","The young men who had grown up with him said to him: “This is what you should say to the people who have said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter for us’; this is what you should tell them, ‘My little finger will be thicker than my father’s hips.","My father imposed a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.’”","Jer·o·boʹam and all the people came to Re·ho·boʹam on the third day, just as the king had said: “Return to me on the third day.”","But the king answered them harshly. Thus King Re·ho·boʹam rejected the advice of the older men.","He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying: “I will make your yoke heavier, and I will add to it. My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.”","So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was caused by the true God, in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through A·hiʹjah the Shiʹlo·nite to Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat.","As for all Israel, because the king refused to listen to them, the people replied to the king: “What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesʹse. Each one to your gods, O Israel! Now look after your own house, O David.” With that all Israel returned to their homes.","But Re·ho·boʹam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.","Then King Re·ho·boʹam sent Ha·doʹram, who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Re·ho·boʹam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.","And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day."],["When Re·ho·boʹam arrived in Jerusalem, he immediately congregated the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 trained  warriors, to fight against Israel in order to restore the kingdom to Re·ho·boʹam.","Then the word of Jehovah came to She·maiʹah the man of the true God, saying:","“Say to Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon the king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,","‘This is what Jehovah says: “You must not go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you return to his house, for I have caused this to happen.”’” So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and returned and did not go against Jer·o·boʹam.","Re·ho·boʹam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities in Judah.","Thus he built up  Bethʹle·hem, Eʹtam, Te·koʹa,","Beth-zur, Soʹco, A·dulʹlam,","Gath, Ma·reʹshah, Ziph,","Ad·o·raʹim, Laʹchish, A·zeʹkah,","Zoʹrah, Aiʹja·lon, and Hebʹron, fortified cities that were in Judah and Benjamin.","Further, he reinforced the  fortified places and put commanders in them and supplied them with food and oil and wine,","and he supplied all the different cities with large shields and lances; he reinforced them to a very great degree. And Judah and Benjamin remained his.","And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him, coming out of all their territories.","The Levites left their pastures and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jer·o·boʹam and his sons had dismissed them from serving as priests to Jehovah.","Jer·o·boʹam then appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goatlike demons  and for the calves that he had made.","And those from all the tribes of Israel who had their heart set on seeking Jehovah the God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.","For three years they strengthened the kingship of Judah and supported Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon, for they walked in the way of David and Solʹo·mon for three years.","Then Re·ho·boʹam took as his wife Maʹha·lath the daughter of David’s son Jerʹi·moth and of Abʹi·ha·il the daughter of Jesʹse’s son E·liʹab.","In time she bore him sons: Jeʹush, Shem·a·riʹah, and Zaʹham.","After her, he married Maʹa·cah the granddaughter of Abʹsa·lom. In time she bore him A·biʹjah, Atʹtai, Ziʹza, and She·loʹmith.","Re·ho·boʹam loved Maʹa·cah the granddaughter of Abʹsa·lom more than all his other wives and concubines, for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines, and he became father to 28 sons and 60 daughters.","So Re·ho·boʹam appointed A·biʹjah the son of Maʹa·cah as head and leader among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.","However, he acted with understanding and sent  some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, to all the fortified cities, and gave them abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them."],["Soon after the kingship of Re·ho·boʹam was firmly established and he had become strong, he abandoned the Law of Jehovah, and also all Israel with him.","In the fifth year of King Re·ho·boʹam, King Shiʹshak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, for they had behaved unfaithfully toward Jehovah.","He had 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and countless troops who came with him from Egypt—Libʹy·ans, Sukʹki·im, and E·thi·oʹpi·ans.","He captured the fortified cities of Judah and finally reached Jerusalem.","She·maiʹah the prophet came to Re·ho·boʹam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shiʹshak, and he said to them: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘You have abandoned me, so I have also abandoned you to the hand of Shiʹshak.’”","At that the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said: “Jehovah is righteous.”","When Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to She·maiʹah, saying: “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, and in a little while I will rescue them. I will not pour out my wrath on Jerusalem through Shiʹshak.","But they will become his servants, so that they will know the difference  between serving me and serving the kings  of other lands.”","So King Shiʹshak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house.  He took everything, including the gold shields that Solʹo·mon had made.","So King Re·ho·boʹam made copper shields to replace them, and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard,  who guarded the entrance of the king’s house.","Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah, the guards would come in and carry them, and then they would return them to the guard chamber.","Because the king humbled himself, Jehovah’s anger turned away from him, and he did not destroy them completely. Moreover, there were some good things found in Judah.","King Re·ho·boʹam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and continued to reign; Re·ho·boʹam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name. The name of the king’s mother was Naʹa·mah the Amʹmon·it·ess.","But he did what was bad, for he had not resolved in his heart to search for Jehovah.","As for Re·ho·boʹam’s history, from beginning to end, is it not written among the words of She·maiʹah the prophet and of Idʹdo the visionary in the genealogical record? And there were constant wars between Re·ho·boʹam and Jer·o·boʹam.","Then Re·ho·boʹam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David; and his son A·biʹjah became king in his place."],["In the 18th year of King Jer·o·boʹam, A·biʹjah became king over Judah.","He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Mi·caiʹah the daughter of U·riʹel of Gibʹe·ah. And there was war between A·biʹjah and Jer·o·boʹam.","So A·biʹjah went to war with an army of 400,000 mighty, trained  warriors. And Jer·o·boʹam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 trained  men, mighty warriors.","A·biʹjah now stood on Mount Zem·a·raʹim, which is in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and said: “Hear me, O Jer·o·boʹam and all Israel.","Do you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave to David a kingdom over Israel forever, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt?","But Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat, the servant of David’s son Solʹo·mon, rose up and rebelled against his lord.","And idle, worthless men kept gathering to him. And they proved superior to Re·ho·boʹam the son of Solʹo·mon when Re·ho·boʹam was young and fainthearted, and he could not hold his own against them.","“And now you think you can hold your own against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David because you are a large crowd and you have the golden calves that Jer·o·boʹam made as gods for you.","Have you not driven out Jehovah’s priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and have you not appointed your own priests just like the peoples of the other lands? Anyone who came along with  a  young bull and seven rams could become a priest of what are not gods.","As for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not abandoned him; our priests, the descendants of Aaron, are ministering to Jehovah, and the Levites assist in the work.","They are making burnt offerings smoke to Jehovah each morning and each evening along with perfumed incense, and the layer bread  is on the table of pure gold, and they light up the golden lampstand and its lamps each evening, because we are caring for our responsibility to Jehovah our God; but you have abandoned him.","Now look! the true God is with us, leading us, with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against you. O men of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of your forefathers, for you will not be successful.”","But Jer·o·boʹam dispatched an ambush to come from behind them, so that they were in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them.","When the men of Judah turned around, they saw that they had to fight the battle both in front and from behind. So they began to cry out to Jehovah, while the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets.","The men of Judah broke out in a war cry, and when the men of Judah shouted the war cry, the true God defeated Jer·o·boʹam and all Israel before A·biʹjah and Judah.","The Israelites fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.","A·biʹjah and his people inflicted a great slaughter on them, and the slain of Israel kept falling, 500,000 trained  men.","Thus the men of Israel were humbled at that time, but the men of Judah proved superior because they relied  on Jehovah the God of their forefathers.","A·biʹjah kept chasing after Jer·o·boʹam and captured cities from him, Bethʹel and its dependent  towns, Jeshʹa·nah and its dependent towns, and Eʹphra·in and its dependent towns.","And Jer·o·boʹam never regained his power during the time of A·biʹjah; then Jehovah struck him down and he died.","But A·biʹjah grew in strength. In time he took 14 wives, and he became father to 22 sons and 16 daughters.","And the rest of A·biʹjah’s history, his deeds and his words, is recorded in the writings  of the prophet Idʹdo."],["Then A·biʹjah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and his son Aʹsa became king in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years.","Aʹsa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.","He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the sacred poles.","Further, he told Judah to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers and to observe the Law and the commandment.","So he removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense stands, and under him, the kingdom continued without disturbance.","He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land had no disturbance and there was no war against him during these years, for Jehovah  gave him rest.","He said to Judah: “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates  and bars. For the land is still at our disposal, because we have searched for Jehovah our God. We have searched, and he has given us rest all around.” So their building was successful.","Aʹsa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and lances. And out of Benjamin were 280,000 mighty warriors who carried bucklers  and were armed with bows.","Later Zeʹrah the E·thi·oʹpi·an came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. When he reached Ma·reʹshah,","Aʹsa went out against him and they drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephʹa·thah at Ma·reʹshah.","Aʹsa then called to Jehovah his God and said: “O Jehovah, it does not matter to you whether those you help are many or have no power. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying  on you, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man prevail against you.”","So Jehovah defeated the E·thi·oʹpi·ans before Aʹsa and before Judah, and the E·thi·oʹpi·ans fled.","Aʹsa and the people with him pursued them as far as Geʹrar, and the E·thi·oʹpi·ans continued falling until not one of them was alive, for they were crushed by Jehovah and by his army. Afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil.","Further, they struck all the cities around Geʹrar, for the dread of Jehovah had come upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was much to plunder in them.","They also attacked the tents of those with livestock, and they captured a great number of flocks and camels, after which they returned to Jerusalem."],["Now the spirit of God came upon Az·a·riʹah the son of Oʹded.","So he went out to meet Aʹsa and said to him: “Hear me, O Aʹsa and all Judah and Benjamin! Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you.","For a long time  Israel had been without the true God, without a priest teaching, and without law.","But when in their distress they returned to Jehovah the God of Israel and searched for him, he let himself be found by them.","In those times no one could travel safely,  for there was much unrest among all the inhabitants of the lands.","Nation was being crushed by nation and one city by another city, because God kept them in disorder with every sort of distress.","But you, be strong and do not become discouraged,  for your activity will be rewarded.”","As soon as Aʹsa heard these words and the prophecy of Oʹded the prophet, he took courage and removed the disgusting idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had captured from the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and he restored Jehovah’s altar that was before the porch of  Jehovah.","And he gathered together all Judah and Benjamin and the foreign residents with them from Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh and Simʹe·on, for they had deserted to him from Israel in great number when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.","So they were gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month of the 15th year of Aʹsa’s reign.","On that day they sacrificed to Jehovah from the spoil they had brought, 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep.","Furthermore, they entered into a covenant to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers with all their heart and with all their soul.","Whoever would not search for Jehovah the God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.","So they took an oath to Jehovah with a loud voice, with joyful shouting, and with the trumpets and horns.","And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had taken the oath with all their heart and they eagerly sought him and he let himself be found by them, and Jehovah continued to give them rest on every side.","Aʹsa the king even removed Maʹa·cah his grandmother from her position as queen mother,  because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole.  Aʹsa cut down her obscene idol and pulverized it and burned it in the Kidʹron Valley.","But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, Aʹsa’s heart was complete  all his life.","And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of the true God—silver, gold, and various utensils.","There was no war until the 35th year of Aʹsa’s reign."],["In the 36th year of the reign of Aʹsa, King Baʹa·sha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up  Raʹmah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to  King Aʹsa of Judah.","At that Aʹsa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of Jehovah’s house and the king’s house  and sent them to King Ben-haʹdad of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying:","“There is a treaty  between me and you and between my father and your father. I am sending you silver and gold. Come, break your treaty  with King Baʹa·sha of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”","Ben-haʹdad listened to King Aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they struck down Iʹjon, Dan, Aʹbel-maʹim, and all the storage places of the cities of Naphʹta·li.","When Baʹa·sha heard of it, he immediately quit building  Raʹmah and abandoned his work on it.","King Aʹsa then took all Judah, and they carried off the stones and timbers of Raʹmah that Baʹa·sha had been building with, and with them he built up  Geʹba and Mizʹpah.","At that time Ha·naʹni the seer came to King Aʹsa of Judah and said to him: “Because you relied  on the king of Syria and did not rely  on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.","Were not the E·thi·oʹpi·ans and the Libʹy·ans a very great army with many chariots  and horsemen? But because you relied on Jehovah, he gave them into your hand.","For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength  in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward  him. You have acted foolishly in this matter; from now on there will be wars against you.”","However, Aʹsa became offended at the seer and put him in prison  because he was enraged at him over this. And Aʹsa began to mistreat others among the people at that same time.","Now the history of Aʹsa, from beginning to end, is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.","In the 39th year of his reign, Aʹsa developed an ailment in his feet until he became very sick; and even in his sickness, he turned, not to Jehovah, but to the healers.","Then Aʹsa was laid to rest with his forefathers; he died in the 41st year of his reign.","So they buried him in the grand burial place that he had excavated for himself in the City of David, and they laid him on a bier that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ingredients mixed into a specially made ointment. Further, they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him."],["And his son Je·hoshʹa·phat became king in his place, and he strengthened his position over Israel.","He stationed military forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Eʹphra·im that Aʹsa his father had captured.","Jehovah continued with Je·hoshʹa·phat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David and did not search for the Baʹals.","For he searched for the God of his father and followed  his commandment and not the practices of Israel.","Jehovah kept the kingdom firmly established in his hand; and all Judah continued to give gifts to Je·hoshʹa·phat, and he had riches and glory in abundance.","His heart became bold in the ways of Jehovah, and he even removed the high places and the sacred poles  from Judah.","In the third year of his reign he sent for his princes, Ben-haʹil, O·ba·diʹah, Zech·a·riʹah, Ne·thanʹel, and Mi·caiʹah, to teach in the cities of Judah.","There were Levites with them: She·maiʹah, Neth·a·niʹah, Zeb·a·diʹah, Asʹa·hel, She·mirʹa·moth, Je·honʹa·than, Ad·o·niʹjah, To·biʹjah, and Tob-ad·o·niʹjah, and along with them E·lishʹa·ma and Je·hoʹram the priests.","They began teaching in Judah, taking with them the book of Jehovah’s Law, and they went around through all the cities of Judah teaching among the people.","And the dread of Jehovah came upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, and they did not fight against Je·hoshʹa·phat.","And the Phi·lisʹtines brought to Je·hoshʹa·phat gifts and money as tribute. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats from their flocks.","Je·hoshʹa·phat grew greater and greater, and he continued building fortified places and storage cities in Judah.","He carried out extensive projects in the cities of Judah, and  he had soldiers, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem.","These were grouped by their paternal houses: of Judah the chiefs of thousands, Adʹnah the chief, and with him were 300,000 mighty warriors.","And under his command was Je·ho·haʹnan the chief, and with him were 280,000.","And also under his command was Am·a·siʹah the son of Zichʹri, who volunteered for Jehovah’s service, and with him were 200,000 mighty warriors.","And out of Benjamin was E·liʹa·da, a mighty warrior, and with him were 200,000 men equipped with the bow and shield.","And under his command was Je·hozʹa·bad, and with him were 180,000 men equipped for the army.","These were ministering to the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."],["Je·hoshʹa·phat had riches and glory in abundance, but he made a marriage alliance with Aʹhab.","So years later he went down to Aʹhab at Sa·marʹi·a, and Aʹhab sacrificed sheep and cattle in abundance for him and for the people with him. And he urged  him to go up against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad.","Then King Aʹhab of Israel said to King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah: “Will you go with me to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad?” He replied to him: “I am the same as you, and my people are the same as your people and will support you in the war.”","But Je·hoshʹa·phat said to the king of Israel: “First inquire, please, for the word of Jehovah.”","So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, 400 men, and said to them: “Should we go to war against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, or should I refrain?” They said: “Go up, and the true God will give it into the king’s hand.”","Je·hoshʹa·phat then said: “Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah? Let us also inquire through him.”","At that the king of Israel said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good things concerning me, but always bad. He is Mi·caiʹah the son of Imʹlah.” However, Je·hoshʹa·phat said: “The king should not say such a thing.”","So the king of Israel called a court official and said: “Bring Mi·caiʹah the son of Imʹlah quickly.”","Now the king of Israel and Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in royal attire; they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sa·marʹi·a, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.","Then Zed·e·kiʹah the son of Che·naʹa·nah made for himself iron horns and said: “This is what Jehovah says, ‘With these you will gore  the Syrians until you exterminate them.’”","All the other prophets were prophesying the same way, saying: “Go up to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king’s hand.”","So the messenger who went to call Mi·caiʹah said to him: “Look! The words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. Let your word, please, become like theirs, and speak favorably.”","But Mi·caiʹah said: “As surely as Jehovah is living, whatever my God says is what I will speak.”","Then he came in to the king, and the king asked him:  “Mi·caiʹah, should we go to war against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, or should I refrain?” At once he replied: “Go up and you will be successful; they will be given into your hand.”","At that the king said to him: “How many times must I put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of Jehovah?”","So he said: “I see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. Jehovah said: ‘These have no master. Let each one go back to his house in peace.’”","Then the king of Israel said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “Did I not tell you, ‘He will not prophesy good things concerning me, only bad’?”","Mi·caiʹah then said: “Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing at his right and at his left.","Jehovah then said, ‘Who will fool King Aʹhab of Israel, so that he will go up and fall at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad?’ And one was saying one thing while another said something else.","Then a spirit  came forward and stood before Jehovah and said, ‘I will fool him.’ Jehovah asked him, ‘How will you do it?’","He replied, ‘I will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ So he said, ‘You will fool him, and what is more, you will be successful. Go out and do that.’","And now Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, but Jehovah has declared calamity for you.”","Zed·e·kiʹah the son of Che·naʹa·nah now approached and struck Mi·caiʹah on the cheek and said: “Which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass from me to speak with you?”","Mi·caiʹah replied: “Look! You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide.”","Then the king of Israel said: “Take Mi·caiʹah and turn him over to Aʹmon the chief of the city and to Joʹash the king’s son.","Tell them, ‘This is what the king says: “Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace.”’”","But Mi·caiʹah said: “If you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.” Then he added: “Take note, all you peoples.”","So the king of Israel and Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah went up to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad.","The king of Israel now said to Je·hoshʹa·phat: “I will disguise myself and will go into the battle, but you should put on your royal attire.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they entered the battle.","Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders: “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”","And as soon as the chariot commanders saw Je·hoshʹa·phat, they said to themselves: “It is the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Je·hoshʹa·phat began to cry for help, and Jehovah helped him, and God at once diverted them from him.","When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they immediately turned back from following him.","But one man shot his bow at random,  and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail. So the king said to his charioteer: “Turn around and take me out of the battle,  for I have been  badly wounded.”","The fighting raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel had to be propped up in the chariot, facing the Syrians until the evening; and he died at sunset."],["Then King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah returned safely  to his own house  in Jerusalem.","Jeʹhu the son of Ha·naʹni the visionary went out to meet him and said to King Je·hoshʹa·phat: “Is it the wicked you should be helping, and is it those who hate Jehovah you should love? Because of this the indignation of Jehovah is against you.","Nevertheless, there are good things that have been found in you, because you cleared out the sacred poles  from the land and you have prepared your heart  to search for the true God.”","Je·hoshʹa·phat continued living in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beʹer-sheʹba to the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, to bring them back to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.","He also appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.","And he said to the judges: “Pay attention to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, and he is with you when you pass judgment.","Now let the fear of Jehovah be upon you. Be careful about what you do, for with Jehovah our God there is no injustice, no partiality, no bribe-taking.”","In Jerusalem also, Je·hoshʹa·phat appointed some of the Levites and the priests and some of the heads of the paternal houses of Israel to serve as judges for Jehovah and to settle legal cases for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","And he commanded them: “This is what you should do in the fear of Jehovah, with faithfulness and a complete  heart:","Whenever your brothers living in their cities bring a legal case that involves the shedding of blood or a question about a law, a commandment, regulations, or judgments, you should warn them so that they may not become guilty before Jehovah; otherwise his indignation will come against you and your brothers. This is what you should do, so that you may not incur guilt.","Here is Am·a·riʹah the chief priest who is over you for every matter of Jehovah. Zeb·a·diʹah the son of Ishʹma·el is the leader of the house of Judah for every matter pertaining to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers for you. Be strong and act, and let Jehovah be with those who do what is good.”"],["Afterward the Moʹab·ites and the Amʹmon·ites, together with some of the Amʹmon·im,  came to wage war against Je·hoshʹa·phat.","So Je·hoshʹa·phat was told: “A large crowd has come against you from the region of the sea,  from Eʹdom, and there they are in Hazʹa·zon-taʹmar, that is, En-gedʹi.”","At that Je·hoshʹa·phat became afraid, and he resolved  to search for Jehovah. So he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.","The people of Judah then gathered together to inquire of Jehovah; they came from all the cities of Judah to consult Jehovah.","Then Je·hoshʹa·phat stood up in the congregation of Judah  and Jerusalem in the house of Jehovah before the new courtyard,","and he said:","O our God, did you not drive away the inhabitants of this land from before your people Israel and then give it as a lasting possession to the offspring  of your friend Abraham?","And they settled in it, and they built for you there a sanctuary for your name, saying,","‘If disaster should come on us, whether by sword, adverse judgment, pestilence, or famine, let us stand before this house and before you (for your name is in this house) and call to you for help out of our distress, and may you hear and save us.’","Now here are the men of Amʹmon, Moʹab, and the mountainous region of Seʹir, whom you did not allow Israel to invade when they came out of the land of Egypt. They turned away from them and did not annihilate them.","Now they are repaying us by coming in to drive us out from your possession that you gave us as an inheritance.","O our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we do not know what we should do, but our eyes are toward you.”","Meanwhile, all those of Judah were standing before Jehovah, along with their little ones, their wives, and their children.","Then in the middle of the congregation, the spirit of Jehovah came upon Ja·ha·ziʹel son of Zech·a·riʹah son of Be·naiʹah son of Je·iʹel son of Mat·ta·niʹah the Levite of the sons of Aʹsaph.","He said: “Pay attention, all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Je·hoshʹa·phat! Here is what Jehovah says to you, ‘Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd, for the battle is not yours but God’s.","Tomorrow go down against them. They will be coming up by the pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley  before the wilderness of Je·ruʹel.","You will not need to fight this battle. Take your position, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.  O Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid or be terrified. Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.’”","At once Je·hoshʹa·phat bowed low with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to worship Jehovah.","Then the Levites who were descendants of the Koʹhath·ites and the Korʹah·ites rose up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with a very loud voice.","They rose up early the next morning and went out to the wilderness of Te·koʹa. As they went out, Je·hoshʹa·phat stood up and said: “Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Put faith in Jehovah your God so that you may be able to stand firm.  Put faith in his prophets, and you will be successful.”","After he consulted with the people, he appointed men to sing to Jehovah and to offer praise in holy adornment as they went out ahead of the armed  men, saying: “Give thanks to Jehovah, for his loyal love endures forever.”","When they began joyfully singing praises, Jehovah set an ambush against the men of Amʹmon, Moʹab, and the mountainous region of Seʹir who were invading Judah, and they struck each other down.","And the Amʹmon·ites and the Moʹab·ites turned against the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seʹir to destroy and annihilate them; and when they finished with the inhabitants of Seʹir, they helped to destroy one another.","But when Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness and looked toward the crowd, there they saw their carcasses fallen to the ground; there were no survivors.","So Je·hoshʹa·phat and his people came to carry off the spoil from them, and they found among them an abundance of goods, clothing, and desirable articles, which they stripped off for themselves until they could carry no more. It took three days to carry off the spoil, for it was abundant.","On the fourth day they congregated together at the Valley  of Berʹa·cah, for there they praised  Jehovah. That is why they named that place Valley of Berʹa·cah —until today.","Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, with Je·hoshʹa·phat at their head, returned to Jerusalem with rejoicing, for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.","So they came into Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets and went to the house of Jehovah.","And the dread of God came upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.","Thus the kingdom of Je·hoshʹa·phat had no disturbance, and his God continued to give him rest on every side.","And Je·hoshʹa·phat continued reigning over Judah. He was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was A·zuʹbah the daughter of Shilʹhi.","He kept walking in the way of his father Aʹsa. He did not deviate from it, and he did what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.","However, the high places were not removed, and the people had not yet prepared their heart for the God of their forefathers.","As for the rest of the history of Je·hoshʹa·phat, from beginning to end, there it is written among the words of Jeʹhu the son of Ha·naʹni, which were included in the Book of the Kings of Israel.","After this King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah made an alliance with King A·ha·ziʹah of Israel, who acted wickedly.","So he made him his partner in making ships to go to Tarʹshish, and they built the ships in Eʹzi·on-geʹber.","However, E·li·eʹzer the son of Dod·avʹa·hu of Ma·reʹsha spoke prophetically against Je·hoshʹa·phat, saying: “Because you have made an alliance with A·ha·ziʹah, Jehovah will destroy your works.” So the ships were wrecked, and they were unable to go to Tarʹshish."],["Then Je·hoshʹa·phat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David; and his son Je·hoʹram became king in his place.","His brothers, Je·hoshʹa·phat’s sons, were Az·a·riʹah, Je·hiʹel, Zech·a·riʹah, Az·a·riʹah, Miʹcha·el, and Sheph·a·tiʹah; all of these were the sons of King Je·hoshʹa·phat of  Israel.","And their father had given them many gifts in silver and gold, and valuable things, along with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Je·hoʹram, for he was the firstborn.","When Je·hoʹram had taken control of the kingdom of his father, he strengthened his position by killing all his brothers with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel.","Je·hoʹram was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.","He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as those of the house of Aʹhab had done, for Aʹhab’s daughter had become his wife; and he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.","But Jehovah did not want to bring the house of David to ruin for the sake of the covenant that he had made with David, since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.","In his days Eʹdom revolted against Judah and then set up its own king.","So Je·hoʹram and his commanders crossed over with all his chariots, and he rose up by night and defeated the Eʹdom·ites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders.","But Eʹdom has kept up its revolt against Judah to this day. Libʹnah also revolted against him at that time, because he had abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers.","He had also made high places on the mountains of Judah to cause the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution, and he led Judah astray.","Eventually a written message came to him from E·liʹjah the prophet, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says, ‘You have not walked in the ways of your father Je·hoshʹa·phat or in the ways of King Aʹsa of Judah.","But you walk in the way of the kings of Israel and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution like the prostitution of the house of Aʹhab, and you even killed your own brothers, the household of your father, who were better than you.","Therefore, Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people, to your sons, to your wives, and to all your possessions.","And you will suffer with many sicknesses, including a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the disease, day after day.’”","Then Jehovah stirred up against Je·hoʹram the Phi·lisʹtines  and the Arabs who were near the E·thi·oʹpi·ans.","So they invaded Judah, forcing their way in, and carried off all the possessions that were found in the king’s house,  as well as his sons and his wives; and the only son left to him was Je·hoʹa·haz,  his youngest son.","And after all of this, Jehovah afflicted him with an incurable disease in his intestines.","Some time later, when two full years had passed, his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died while suffering severely from his disease; and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning that was made for his forefathers.","He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted it when he died.

Conspiracy!”","But Je·hoiʹa·da the priest brought out the chiefs of hundreds, those appointed over the army, and said to them: “Take her out from among the ranks, and if anyone follows her, put him to death with the sword!” For the priest had said: “Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.”","So they seized her, and when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s house,  they immediately put her to death there.","Then Je·hoiʹa·da made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they would continue as the people of Jehovah.","After that all the people came to the house  of Baʹal and tore it down, and they smashed his altars and his images, and they killed Matʹtan the priest of Baʹal  in front of the altars.","Then Je·hoiʹa·da put the oversight of the house of Jehovah in the hands of the priests and the Levites, whom David had assigned in divisions over the house of Jehovah to offer up the burnt sacrifices of Jehovah according to what is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with song, as directed by  David.","He also stationed the gatekeepers by the gates of the house of Jehovah, so that no one unclean in any respect could enter.","He now took the chiefs of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land and escorted the king down from the house of Jehovah. Then they came through the upper gate to the king’s house  and seated the king on the throne of the kingdom.","So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, for they had put Ath·a·liʹah to death with the sword."],["Je·hoʹash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibʹi·ah from Beʹer-sheʹba.","Je·hoʹash continued doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes all the days of Je·hoiʹa·da the priest.","Je·hoiʹa·da chose two wives for him, and he became father to sons and daughters.","Afterward it was the heart’s desire of Je·hoʹash to renovate the house of Jehovah.","So he gathered the priests and the Levites together and said to them: “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year; and you should act quickly in the matter.” But the Levites did not act quickly.","So the king called Je·hoiʹa·da the chief and said to him: “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the sacred tax ordered by Moses the servant of Jehovah, the sacred tax of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the Testimony?","For the sons of Ath·a·liʹah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of the true God, and they had used all the holy things of the house of Jehovah for the Baʹals.”","Then, at the king’s order, a chest was made and placed outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.","After that a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the sacred tax that Moses the servant of the true God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness.","All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they kept bringing contributions and dropping them into the chest until it was full.","Whenever the Levites brought the chest in to be turned over to the king and they saw that there was a great deal of money in it, the secretary of the king and the commissioner of the chief priest would come and empty the chest, and then they would take it back to its place. That was what they did from day to day, and they gathered money in abundance.","Then the king and Je·hoiʹa·da would give it to those supervising the work of the service of Jehovah’s house, and they would hire the stonecutters and the craftsmen for renovating Jehovah’s house, and also workers in iron and copper to repair Jehovah’s house.","And those supervising the work got it started, and the repair work  progressed under their supervision, and they restored the house of the true God to its proper condition and reinforced it.","And as soon as they finished, they brought the money that was left over to the king and Je·hoiʹa·da, and they used it to make utensils for the house of Jehovah, utensils for the ministry and for making offerings and cups and utensils of gold and of silver. And they would offer up burnt sacrifices at the house of Jehovah regularly all the days of Je·hoiʹa·da.","When Je·hoiʹa·da was old and satisfied with years, he died; he was 130 years old at his death.","So they buried him in the City of David along with the kings, because he had done good in Israel with respect to the true God and His house.","After Je·hoiʹa·da’s death the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them.","They abandoned the house of Jehovah the God of their forefathers and began serving the sacred poles  and the idols, so that God’s anger came  against Judah and Jerusalem because of their guilt.","He kept sending prophets among them to bring them back to Jehovah, and they kept warning  them, but they refused to listen.","God’s spirit came upon  Zech·a·riʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them: “This is what the true God says, ‘Why are you violating the commandments of Jehovah?

Because you have abandoned Jehovah, he will, in turn, abandon you.’”","But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king’s order in the courtyard of Jehovah’s house.","Thus King Je·hoʹash did not remember the loyal love that his father  Je·hoiʹa·da had shown toward him, and he killed his son, who said as he was dying: “May Jehovah see to it and call you to account.”","At the beginning of the year  the Syrian army came up against Je·hoʹash, and they invaded Judah and Jerusalem. Then they did away with all the princes of the people, and they sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.","For although the invading Syrian army had a small number of men, Jehovah handed over to them a very large army, because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers; so they  executed judgment on Je·hoʹash.","And when they withdrew from him (for they left him severely wounded ), his own servants conspired against him because he had shed the blood of the sons  of Je·hoiʹa·da the priest.

Otherwise, the true God could cause you to stumble before an enemy, for God has the power to help and to cause stumbling.”","At this Am·a·ziʹah said to the man of the true God: “But what about the 100 talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?” The man of the true God replied: “Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.”","So Am·a·ziʹah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Eʹphra·im, sending them to their own place. However, they were very angry with Judah, so they returned to their own place in the heat of anger.","Then Am·a·ziʹah took courage and led his own troops to the Valley of Salt, and he struck down 10,000 men of Seʹir.","And the men of Judah captured 10,000 alive. So they brought them to the top of the crag and threw them down from the top of the crag, and they were all dashed to pieces.","But the members of the troop whom Am·a·ziʹah had sent back from accompanying him to the war were making raids on the cities of Judah, from Sa·marʹi·a clear to Beth-hoʹron; they struck down 3,000 of them and took much spoil.","But after Am·a·ziʹah returned from striking down the Eʹdom·ites, he brought the gods of the men of Seʹir and set them up for himself as gods, and he began to bow down before them and to make sacrificial smoke to them.","So Jehovah grew very angry with Am·a·ziʹah, and he sent a prophet who said to him: “Why are you following the people’s gods that did not rescue their own people out of your hand?”","As he spoke to him, the king said: “Did we appoint you as an adviser to the king? Stop! Why should they strike you down?” Then the prophet quit, but he added: “I know that God has decided to bring you to ruin, because you have done this and you have not listened to my advice.”","After consulting with his advisers, King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah sent a message to Je·hoʹash  son of Je·hoʹa·haz son of Jeʹhu the king of Israel, saying: “Come, let us confront each other in battle.”","King Je·hoʹash of Israel sent this message to King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah: “The thorny weed in Lebʹa·non sent a message to the cedar in Lebʹa·non, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ However, a wild beast of Lebʹa·non passed by and trampled down the thorny weed.","You have said, ‘Look! I  have struck down Eʹdom.’ So your heart has become arrogant, wanting to be glorified. But now stay in your own house.  Why should you provoke disaster and fall, bringing Judah down with you?”","But Am·a·ziʹah did not listen, for this was from the true God to give them into the hand of the enemy, because they had followed the gods of Eʹdom.","So King Je·hoʹash of Israel went up, and he and King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-sheʹmesh, which belongs to Judah.","Judah was defeated by Israel, so each one fled to his home.","King Je·hoʹash of Israel captured King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah, son of Je·hoʹash son of Je·hoʹa·haz,  at Beth-sheʹmesh.

Then he built cities in the territory of Ashʹdod and among the Phi·lisʹtines.","The true God continued to help him against the Phi·lisʹtines, against the Arabians who were dwelling in Gur·baʹal, and against the Me·uʹnim.","The Amʹmon·ites began to give tribute to Uz·ziʹah. His fame eventually spread as far as Egypt, for he became extremely powerful.","Moreover, Uz·ziʹah built towers in Jerusalem by the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the Buttress, and he fortified them.","Further, he built towers in the wilderness and dug  many cisterns (for he had a great deal of livestock); he also did so in the She·pheʹlah and on the plain.  He had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carʹmel, for he loved agriculture.","Moreover, Uz·ziʹah came to have an army equipped for war. They would go out on military campaigns, organized in divisions.

So his fame spread far and wide, for he received tremendous help and he became strong.","However, as soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty to his own ruin, and he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God by entering the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.","Immediately Az·a·riʹah the priest and 80 other courageous priests of Jehovah went in after him.","They confronted King Uz·ziʹah and said to him: “It is not proper for you, Uz·ziʹah, to burn incense to Jehovah! It is only the priests who should burn incense, for they are the descendants of Aaron, those who have been sanctified. Go out from the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully and you will receive no glory from Jehovah God for this.”","But Uz·ziʹah, who had a censer in his hand to burn incense, became enraged; and during his rage against the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of Jehovah next to the altar of incense.","When Az·a·riʹah the chief priest and all the priests turned toward him, they saw that he had been stricken with leprosy in his forehead!

The Amʹmon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years.","So Joʹtham kept growing strong, for he established  his ways before Jehovah his God.","As for the rest of the history of Joʹtham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah.","He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem.","Then Joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David.

So they clothed them and gave them sandals, food and drink, and oil for their skin. Furthermore, they transported the feeble on donkeys and brought them to their brothers in Jerʹi·cho, the city of palm trees. After that they returned to Sa·marʹi·a.","At that time King Aʹhaz asked the kings of As·syrʹi·a for help.","And once again the Eʹdom·ites invaded and attacked Judah and carried off captives.","The Phi·lisʹtines also made a raid on the cities of the She·pheʹlah and the Negʹeb of Judah and captured Beth-sheʹmesh, Aiʹja·lon, Ge·deʹroth, Soʹco and its dependent  towns, Timʹnah and its dependent towns, and Gimʹzo and its dependent towns; and they settled there.","Jehovah humbled Judah because of King Aʹhaz of Israel, for he had let Judah go unrestrained, resulting in great unfaithfulness toward Jehovah.","King Tilʹgath-pil·neʹser of As·syrʹi·a eventually came against him and caused him distress rather than strengthening him.","For Aʹhaz had stripped the house of Jehovah and the house  of the king and the houses of the princes and made a gift to the king of As·syrʹi·a; but it was of no help to him.","And during his time of distress, King Aʹhaz acted even more unfaithfully toward Jehovah.","He began to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, and he went on to say: “Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.” But they caused him and all Israel to stumble.","Furthermore, Aʹhaz collected the utensils of the house of the true God; he then cut to pieces the utensils of the house of the true God, closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.","And in all the cities of Judah, he made high places for making sacrificial smoke to other gods, and he offended Jehovah the God of his forefathers.","As for the rest of his history, all his dealings from beginning to end, there it is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.","Then Aʹhaz was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in  the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the burial places of the kings of Israel.

The priests and the Levites felt ashamed, so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.","They took their  customary places, according to the Law of Moses the man of the true God; then the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites.","There were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves, and the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover sacrifices for all who were not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.","For a great number of the people, especially those from Eʹphra·im, Ma·nasʹseh, Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun, had not cleansed themselves, but they still ate the Passover, contrary to what is written.

And they ate throughout the festival for seven days, sacrificing communion sacrifices and giving thanks to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.","Then all the congregation decided to observe it for seven more days, so they observed it for seven more days with rejoicing.","And King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; and priests were sanctifying themselves in great number.","And all the congregation of Judah, the priests, the Levites, all the congregation that came from Israel, and the foreign residents who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah continued rejoicing.","And there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solʹo·mon the son of David the king of Israel, nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem.","Finally the Levite priests stood up and blessed the people; and God heard their voice, and their prayer reached his holy dwelling, the heavens."],["As soon as they had finished all of this, all the Israelites who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and they smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the sacred poles,  and tore down the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh, until they had destroyed them completely, after which all the Israelites returned to their cities, each one to his own possession.","Then Hez·e·kiʹah appointed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their divisions, each of the priests and Levites for their service, for the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, to minister and to give thanks and praise in the gates of the courtyards  of Jehovah.","A portion of the king’s own goods was given for the burnt offerings, including the  morning and evening offerings, as well as the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the festivals, according to what is written in the Law of Jehovah.","Furthermore, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and the Levites, so that they might adhere strictly  to the law of Jehovah.","As soon as the order was issued, the Israelites gave in great quantities the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field; they brought in abundantly the tenth of everything.","And the people of Israel and of Judah living in the cities of Judah also brought in the tenth of cattle and sheep and the tenth of the holy things that were sanctified to Jehovah their God. They brought it in and put it in many heaps.","In the third month they began laying their contributions in heaps; and in the seventh month they finished.","When Hez·e·kiʹah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they praised Jehovah and blessed his people Israel.","Hez·e·kiʹah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps,","and Az·a·riʹah the chief priest of the house of Zaʹdok said to him: “From the time they started bringing the contributions into the house of Jehovah, the people have been eating to satisfaction and there is still an abundant surplus, for Jehovah has blessed his people, and this great plenty is left over.”","At this Hez·e·kiʹah told them to prepare storerooms  in the house of Jehovah, so they prepared them.","They kept faithfully bringing in the contributions, the tenth parts,  and the holy things; Con·a·niʹah the Levite was put in charge of all of this as supervisor, and his brother Shimʹe·i was second.","Je·hiʹel, Az·a·ziʹah, Naʹhath, Asʹa·hel, Jerʹi·moth, Joʹza·bad, Eʹli·el, Is·ma·chiʹah, Maʹhath, and Be·naiʹah were commissioners assisting Con·a·niʹah and his brother Shimʹe·i, by the order of King Hez·e·kiʹah, and Az·a·riʹah was supervisor of the house of the true God.","And Koʹre the son of Imʹnah, the Levite gatekeeper on the east side, was in charge of the voluntary offerings of the true God, and he distributed the contribution made to Jehovah and the most holy things.","And under his direction were Eʹden, Mi·niʹa·min, Jeshʹu·a, She·maiʹah, Am·a·riʹah, and Shec·a·niʹah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to distribute equally to their brothers in the divisions, to great and small alike.","This was in addition to the distribution made to the males from three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical enrollment, who came daily to serve in the house of Jehovah and to carry out the duties of their divisions.","The genealogical enrollment of the priests was by their paternal house, as was that of the Levites who were 20 years old and up, by the duties of their divisions.","The genealogical enrollment included all their children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, their entire congregation—for they kept themselves sanctified for what was holy because of their office of trust—","as well as the descendants of Aaron, the priests who were living in the fields of  the pastures surrounding their cities. In all the cities, men had been designated by name to give portions to every male among the priests and to everyone included in the genealogical enrollment of the Levites.","Hez·e·kiʹah did this throughout Judah, and he continued to do what was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.","And every work that he undertook to search for his God, whether in connection with the service of the house of the true God or in the Law and the commandment, he did wholeheartedly, and he was successful."],["After these things and these acts of faithfulness, King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a came and invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities, intent on breaking through and capturing them.","When Hez·e·kiʹah saw that Sen·nachʹer·ib had come and intended to wage war against Jerusalem,","he decided, after consulting with his princes and his warriors, to stop up the waters of the springs outside the city, and they gave him their support.","Many people were gathered together, and they stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land, saying: “Why should the kings of As·syrʹi·a come and find plenty of water?”","Furthermore, with determination he rebuilt the entire broken-down wall and raised towers on it, and outside he made another wall. He also repaired the Mound  of the City of David, and he made a large number of weapons  and shields.","He then appointed military chiefs over the people and assembled them at the public square of the city gate and encouraged them,  saying:","“Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or be terrified because of the king of As·syrʹi·a and all the multitude with him, for there are more with us than there are with him.","With him is an arm of flesh,  but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people were strengthened by the words of King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah.","After this, while King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a was at Laʹchish with all his imperial might,  he sent his servants to Jerusalem, to King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah and to all the Ju·deʹans in Jerusalem, saying:","“This is what King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a says, ‘In what are you trusting that you remain in Jerusalem while it is besieged?","Is not Hez·e·kiʹah misleading you and handing you over to die by famine and thirst, saying: “Jehovah our God will rescue us from the hand of the king of As·syrʹi·a”?","Is this not the same Hez·e·kiʹah who removed your God’s  high places and His altars and then said to Judah and Jerusalem: “You should bow down before one altar and on it you should make your sacrifices smoke”?","Do you not know what I and my forefathers did to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands able to rescue their land from my hand?","Who among all the gods of these nations that my forefathers devoted to destruction was able to rescue his people from my hand, so that your  God should be able to rescue you from my hand?","Now do not let Hez·e·kiʹah deceive you or mislead you like this! Do not put faith in him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to rescue his people from my hand and from the hand of my forefathers. How much less, then, will your own God rescue you from my hand!’”","His servants said even more against Jehovah the true God and against Hez·e·kiʹah his servant.","He also wrote letters to insult Jehovah the God of Israel and to speak against him, saying: “Like the gods of the nations of the lands who could not rescue their people from my hand, so the God of Hez·e·kiʹah will not rescue his people from my hand.”","They kept calling loudly in the language of the Jews to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to make them afraid and to terrify them, in order to capture the city.","They spoke against the God of Jerusalem the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of man’s hands.","But King Hez·e·kiʹah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz kept praying about this and crying out to the heavens for help.","Then Jehovah sent an angel and wiped out every mighty warrior, leader, and chief in the camp of the king of As·syrʹi·a, so that he went back to his own land in disgrace. He later entered the house  of his god, and there some of his own sons struck him down with the sword.","So Jehovah saved Hez·e·kiʹah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a and from the hand of all others and gave them rest on every side.","And many brought gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and choice things to King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah, and he was greatly respected by all the nations after that.","In those days Hez·e·kiʹah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to Jehovah, who answered him and gave him a sign.","But Hez·e·kiʹah did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him, for his heart became haughty, bringing indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.","However, Hez·e·kiʹah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hez·e·kiʹah.","And Hez·e·kiʹah came to have vast riches and glory; and he made storehouses for himself for silver, gold, precious stones, balsam oil, shields, and for all the desirable articles.","He also made storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil, as well as stalls for all the different kinds of livestock and stalls for the flocks.","He also acquired cities for himself, and an abundance of livestock, flocks, and herds, for God gave him very many possessions.","It was Hez·e·kiʹah who stopped up the upper source of the waters of Giʹhon and directed them straight down to the west to the City of David, and Hez·e·kiʹah was successful in every work of his.","However, when the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon were sent to ask him about the sign  that had occurred in the land, the true God left him alone to put him to the test, to get to know all that was in his heart.","As for the rest of the history of Hez·e·kiʹah and his acts of loyal love, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Aʹmoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.","Then Hez·e·kiʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Ma·nasʹseh became king in his place."],["Ma·nasʹseh was 12 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem.","He did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the people of Israel.","He rebuilt the high places that his father Hez·e·kiʹah had torn down, he set up altars to the Baʹals and made sacred poles,  and he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them.","He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, about which Jehovah had said: “In Jerusalem my name will be forever.”","And he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah.","And he made his own sons pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom; he practiced magic, used divination, practiced sorcery, and appointed spirit mediums and fortune-tellers. He did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, to offend him.","He put the carved image that he made into the house of the true God about which God had said to David and to his son Solʹo·mon: “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will permanently put my name.","And I will never again remove the feet of Israel from the land that I assigned to their forefathers, provided they carefully observe all that I have commanded them, the entire Law, the regulations and the judicial decisions given through Moses.”","Ma·nasʹseh kept leading Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, causing them to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the Israelites.","Jehovah kept speaking to Ma·nasʹseh and his people, but they paid no attention.","So Jehovah brought against them the army chiefs of the king of As·syrʹi·a, and they captured Ma·nasʹseh with hooks  and bound him with two copper fetters and took him to Babylon.","In his distress, he begged Jehovah his God for favor  and kept humbling himself greatly before the God of his forefathers.","He kept praying to Him, and He was moved by his entreaty and heard his request for favor, and He restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship. Then Ma·nasʹseh came to know that Jehovah is the true God.","After this he built an outer wall for the City of David west of Giʹhon in the valley  and as far as the Fish Gate, and he continued it around to Oʹphel, and he made it very high. Further, he appointed army chiefs in all the fortified cities in Judah.","He then removed the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of Jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and  he had them thrown outside the city.","He also prepared the altar of Jehovah and began to offer up communion sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices on it, and he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.","Nevertheless, the people were still sacrificing on the high places, although only to Jehovah their God.","As for the rest of the history of Ma·nasʹseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the visionaries who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, they are recorded in the history of the kings of Israel.","Also his prayer and how his entreaty was granted him, all his sins and his unfaithfulness, the locations where he built high places and set up the sacred poles  and the graven images before he humbled himself, they are written among the words of his visionaries.","Then Ma·nasʹseh was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him at his house; and his son Aʹmon became king in his place.","Aʹmon was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.","And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Ma·nasʹseh had done; and Aʹmon sacrificed to all the graven images that his father Ma·nasʹseh had made, and he kept serving them.","But he did not humble himself before Jehovah as Ma·nasʹseh his father had humbled himself; instead, Aʹmon greatly increased his guilt.","Eventually his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.","But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Aʹmon, and they made his son Jo·siʹah king in his place."],["Jo·siʹah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem.","He did what was right in Jehovah’s eyes and walked in the ways of David his forefather, and he did not deviate to the right or to the left.","In the 8th year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he started to search for the God of David his forefather; and in the 12th year, he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places and the sacred poles,  the graven images, and the metal statues.","Further, they tore down the altars of the Baʹals in his presence, and he cut down the incense stands that were up above them. He also broke into pieces the sacred poles,  the graven images, and the metal statues  and reduced them to powder and sprinkled it over the graves of those who used to sacrifice to them.","And he burned the bones of priests on their altars. Thus he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.","And in the cities of Ma·nasʹseh, Eʹphra·im, Simʹe·on, and clear to Naphʹta·li, in their surrounding ruins,","he tore down the altars and he crushed the sacred poles  and the graven images, reducing them to powder; and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of Israel, after which he returned to Jerusalem.","In the 18th year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land and the temple,  he sent Shaʹphan the son of Az·a·liʹah, Ma·a·seiʹah the chief of the city, and Joʹah the son of Joʹa·haz the recorder to repair the house of Jehovah his God.","They came  to Hil·kiʹah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought to the house of God, which the Levites serving as doorkeepers had collected from Ma·nasʹseh, Eʹphra·im, and all the rest of Israel, as well as from Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Then they gave it to those who were appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah. In turn the workers in the house of Jehovah used it to mend and repair the house.","They gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy hewn stones and timbers for braces and to build with beams the houses that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.","And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed the Levites Jaʹhath and O·ba·diʹah of the Me·rarʹites, and Zech·a·riʹah and Me·shulʹlam of the Koʹhath·ites, to serve as overseers. And the Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians,","were in charge of the common laborers  and were overseers of all those who were doing the work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.","While they were taking out the money that had been brought to the house of Jehovah, Hil·kiʹah the priest found the book of Jehovah’s Law given through  Moses.","So Hil·kiʹah said to Shaʹphan the secretary: “I have found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.” With that Hil·kiʹah gave the book to Shaʹphan.","Then Shaʹphan brought the book to the king and told him: “Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them.","They have poured out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and they have handed it over to the appointed men and to those doing the work.”","Shaʹphan the secretary also told the king: “There is a book that Hil·kiʹah the priest has given me.” Then Shaʹphan began to read from it before the king.","As soon as the king heard the words of the Law, he ripped his garments apart.","Then the king gave this order to Hil·kiʹah, A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan, Abʹdon the son of Miʹcah, Shaʹphan the secretary, and A·saiʹah the king’s servant:","“Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf and in behalf of those who remain in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found; for Jehovah’s rage that will be poured out against us is great because our forefathers did not carry out the word of Jehovah by observing all that is written in this book.”","So Hil·kiʹah, along with those sent by the king, went to Hulʹdah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shalʹlum son of Tikʹvah son of Harʹhas, the caretaker of the wardrobe, and she was dwelling in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem; and they spoke to her there.","She said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Tell the man who sent you to me:","“This is what Jehovah says, ‘I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of Judah.","Because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the works of their hands, my rage will pour out on this place and it will  not be extinguished.’”","But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, this is what you should say to him, “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘Regarding the words that you have heard,","because your heart was responsive  and you humbled yourself before God on hearing his words concerning this place and its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before me and ripped your garments apart and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares Jehovah.","That is why I will gather you to your ancestors,  and you will be laid in your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.’”’”","So the king sent word and summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.","After that the king went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites—all the people, the great as well as the small. He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Jehovah.","The king stood in his place and made a covenant  before Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and keep his commandments, his reminders, and his regulations with all his heart and with all his soul  by carrying out the words of the covenant that were written in this book.","Furthermore, he had all those who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin to agree to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their forefathers.","Jo·siʹah then removed all the detestable things  out of all the lands that belonged to the Israelites, and he made everyone in Israel serve Jehovah their God.

There was no need for them to leave their service, because their brothers the Levites made preparations for them.","So all the service of Jehovah was prepared on that day to hold the Passover and to offer up the burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the order of King Jo·siʹah.","The Israelites who were present held the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.","There had never been held a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the other kings of Israel held a Passover like that held by Jo·siʹah, the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","This Passover was held in the 18th year of Jo·siʹah’s reign.","After all of this, when Jo·siʹah had prepared the temple,  King Neʹcho of Egypt came up to fight at Carʹche·mish by the Eu·phraʹtes.

Let us, please, stop this lending on interest.","Please, restore to them on this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth  of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are demanding as interest from them.”","To this they said: “We will restore these things to them and ask nothing back. We will do precisely as you say.” So I called the priests and made those men swear to keep this promise.","Also, I shook out the folds of my garment  and said: “In this manner may the true God shake out from his house and from his possessions every man who does not carry out this promise, and in this manner may he be shaken out and emptied.” To this all the congregation said: “Amen!”  And they praised Jehovah, and the people did as they promised.","Moreover, from the day that he commissioned me to become their governor in the land of Judah, from the 20th year to the 32nd year of King Ar·ta·xerxʹes, 12 years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance due the governor.","But  the former governors who were before me had burdened the people and had been taking from them 40 silver shekels  for bread and wine each day. Also, their attendants had oppressed the people. But I did not do that because of the fear of God.","Furthermore, I took a hand in the work on this wall, and not a field did we acquire; all my attendants were gathered there for the work.","There were 150 Jews and deputy rulers dining at my table, as well as those who came to us from the nations.","Every day one bull, six choice sheep, and birds were prepared for me,  and once every ten days we had all sorts of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not demand the food allowance due the governor, because the people were already bearing their burden of service.","Do remember me favorably,  O my God, for all that I have done in behalf of this people."],["Now as soon as San·balʹlat, To·biʹah, Geʹshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies were told that I had rebuilt the wall and that there were no gaps left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),","San·balʹlat and Geʹshem immediately sent this message to me: “Come, and let us set a time to meet together in the villages of the Valley Plain of Oʹno.” But they were scheming to harm me.","So I sent messengers to them, saying: “I am engaged in a great work, and I am not able to go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come to you?”","They sent me the same message four times, and I gave them the same reply each time.","Then San·balʹlat sent his attendant to me with the same message a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.","There it was written: “Among the nations it has been heard, and Geʹshem is also saying it, that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel. That is why you are building the wall; and according to these reports you are to become their king.","Also, you have appointed prophets to proclaim about you throughout Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ And now these things will be told to the king. So come, and let us discuss this together.”","However, I sent him this reply: “None of the things you are saying have taken place; you are making them up out of your own imagination.”","For they were all trying to frighten us, saying: “Their hands will slacken in the work, and it will not be done.” Now, I pray, strengthen my hands.","Then I went to the house of She·maiʹah the son of De·laʹiah the son of Me·hetʹa·bel while he was confined there. He said: “Let us set a time to meet at the house of the true God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night.”","But I said: “Should a man like me run away? Can a man like me go into the temple and live? I will not go in!”","Then I realized that God had not sent him, but that To·biʹah and San·balʹlat had hired him to speak this prophecy against me.","He had been hired to frighten me and to cause me to sin, so that they would have grounds to damage my reputation in order to reproach me.","Do remember, O my God, To·biʹah and San·balʹlat and  these deeds, and also No·a·diʹah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were constantly trying to frighten me.","So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Eʹlul,  in 52 days.","As soon as all our enemies heard of it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they became greatly ashamed,  and they realized that it was with our God’s help that this work had been done.","In those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to To·biʹah, and To·biʹah would reply to them.","Many in Judah swore allegiance to him, for he was a son-in-law of Shec·a·niʹah the son of Aʹrah, and his son Je·ho·haʹnan had married the daughter of Me·shulʹlam the son of Ber·e·chiʹah.","Also, they would constantly tell me good things about him and then report to him what I said. Then To·biʹah would send letters to frighten me."],["As soon as the wall had been rebuilt I set up the doors; then the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed.","I then put my brother Ha·naʹni in charge of Jerusalem, along with Han·a·niʹah the chief of the Fortress, for he was a most trustworthy man and feared the true God more than many others.","So I said to them: “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the heat of the day, and while they are standing guard, they should shut the doors and bolt them. And assign the inhabitants of Jerusalem as guards, each to his assigned guardpost and each in front of his own house.”","Now the city was spacious and large, and there were few people inside it, and the houses had not been rebuilt.","But my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to be enrolled genealogically.

You made a name for yourself that remains to this day.","And you split the sea before them, so that they crossed through the sea on the dry land, and you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone thrown into the turbulent waters.","You led them by day with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire, to light up for them the way they should go.","And you came down on Mount Siʹnai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them righteous judgments, laws of truth,  good regulations and commandments.","You made known to them your holy Sabbath, and you gave them commandments, regulations, and a law through your servant Moses.","You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry, and you brought water out of the crag when they were thirsty, and you told them to enter and take possession of the land that you had sworn  to give to them.","“But they, our forefathers, acted presumptuously and became stubborn,  and they would not listen to your commandments.","They refused to listen, and they did not remember your extraordinary acts that you performed among them, but they became stubborn  and appointed a head to return to their slavery in Egypt.

The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way they should go.","And you gave your good spirit to give them insight, and you did not hold back your manna from their mouth, and you gave them water when they were thirsty.","For 40 years you provided them with food in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their garments did not wear out, and their feet did not become swollen.","“You gave them kingdoms and peoples, apportioning them piece by piece, so that they took possession of the land of Siʹhon, that is, the land of the king of Heshʹbon, as well as the land of Og the king of Baʹshan.","And you made their sons as numerous as the stars of the heavens. Then you brought them into the land that you had promised their forefathers that they should enter and possess.","So their sons went in and took possession of the land, and you subdued before them the Caʹnaan·ites, who were the inhabitants of the land, and you gave them into their hand, both their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them as they pleased.","And they captured fortified cities and a fertile  land, and they took possession  of houses full of all sorts of good things, cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and grew satisfied and fat, and they basked in your great goodness.","“However, they became disobedient and rebelled against you and turned their back on your Law.  They killed your prophets who warned them so as to bring them back to you, and they committed acts of great disrespect.","For this you gave them into the hand of their adversaries, who kept causing them distress.

Let them be put in the care of Hegʹa·i the king’s eunuch and guardian of the women, and let them be given beauty treatments.","And the young woman who is most pleasing to the king will be queen instead of Vashʹti.” The suggestion was pleasing to the king, and that is what he did.","There was a certain Jewish man in Shuʹshan  the citadel  whose name was Morʹde·cai son of Jaʹir son of Shimʹe·i son of Kish, a Benʹja·min·ite,","who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the people who were deported with King Jec·o·niʹah  of Judah, whom King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon took into exile.","He was the guardian  of Ha·dasʹsah,  that is, Esther, the daughter of his father’s brother, for she had neither father nor mother.

He also transferred her and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women.","Esther did not say  anything about her people or her relatives, for Morʹde·cai had instructed her not to tell anyone.","Day after day Morʹde·cai would walk in front of the courtyard of the house of the women  to learn about Esther’s welfare and about what was happening to her.","Each young woman had her turn to go in to King A·has·u·eʹrus after completing the 12-month treatment that was prescribed for the women, for this was the way they had to fulfill their beauty treatment —six months with oil of myrrh and six months with balsam oil and various ointments for beauty treatment.","Then the young woman was ready to go in to the king, and whatever she asked for would be given her when she went from the house of the women  to the king’s house.","In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women,  under the care of Sha·ashʹgaz the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the concubines. She would not go to the king again unless the king had been especially pleased with her and she was requested by name.","And when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abʹi·ha·il the uncle of Morʹde·cai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegʹa·i the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the women, recommended. (All the while Esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her.)","Esther was taken to King A·has·u·eʹrus at his royal house in the tenth month, that is, the month of Teʹbeth,  in the seventh year of his reign.","And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, and she won his favor and approval  more than any of the other virgins. So he put the royal headdress  on her head and made her queen instead of Vashʹti.","And the king held a great banquet for all his princes and his servants, the banquet of Esther. He then proclaimed an amnesty for the provinces,  and he kept giving gifts according to the means of the king.","Now when virgins  were brought together a second time, Morʹde·cai was sitting in the king’s gate.","Esther did not say anything about her relatives and her people, just as Morʹde·cai had instructed her; Esther continued to do what Morʹde·cai said, just as when she was under his care.","In those days while Morʹde·cai was sitting in the king’s gate, Bigʹthan and Teʹresh, two court officials of the king, doorkeepers, got angry and plotted to do away with  King A·has·u·eʹrus.","But Morʹde·cai learned about it, and he immediately told Queen Esther. Esther then spoke to the king in Morʹde·cai’s name.","So the matter was investigated and eventually confirmed, and both men were hanged on a stake; and this was all recorded in the book of the history of the times in the presence of the king."],["After this King A·has·u·eʹrus promoted Haʹman the son of Ham·me·daʹtha the Agʹag·ite and exalted him by putting his throne above all the other princes who were with him.","And all the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate would bow low and prostrate themselves to Haʹman, for this is what the king had commanded respecting him. But Morʹde·cai refused to bow low or prostrate himself.","So the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate said to Morʹde·cai: “Why are you ignoring the king’s commandment?”","Day after day they would ask him, but he would not listen to them. Then they told Haʹman to see whether Morʹde·cai’s conduct would be tolerated; for he had told them that he was a Jew.","Now when Haʹman saw that Morʹde·cai refused to bow low and prostrate himself to him, Haʹman became filled with rage.","But he despised the thought of doing away with  Morʹde·cai alone, for they had told him about Morʹde·cai’s people. So Haʹman began seeking to annihilate all the Jews who were in the entire realm of A·has·u·eʹrus, all of Morʹde·cai’s people.","In the first month, that is, the month of Niʹsan,  in the 12th year of King A·has·u·eʹrus, they cast Pur (that is, the Lot) before Haʹman to determine the day and the month, and it fell on the 12th month, that is, Aʹdar.","Haʹman then said to King A·has·u·eʹrus: “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces  of your realm, whose laws are different from those of all other peoples; and they do not obey the king’s laws, and it is not in the king’s interests to let them be.","If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed. I will pay 10,000 silver talents  to the officials to put into the royal treasury.”","At that the king removed his signet ring from his own hand and gave it to Haʹman the son of Ham·me·daʹtha the Agʹag·ite, who was the enemy of the Jews.","The king said to Haʹman: “The silver and the people are given to you, to do with them as you see fit.”","The king’s secretaries were then called on the 13th day of the first month. They put in writing all of Haʹman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors who were over the provinces,  and the princes of the different peoples, to each province  in its own script  and to each people in its own language. It was written in the name of King A·has·u·eʹrus and sealed with the king’s signet ring.","The letters were sent by means of couriers to all the king’s provinces,  giving the order to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all the Jews, young and old alike, children and women, on a single day, on the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Aʹdar, and to seize their possessions.","A copy of the document was to be issued as a law in every province  and proclaimed to all the peoples, so that they would be prepared for that day.","The couriers went out quickly by order of the king; the law was issued in Shuʹshan  the citadel.  The king and Haʹman then sat down to drink, but the city of Shuʹshan  was in confusion."],["When Morʹde·cai learned of everything that had been done, he ripped his garments  apart and put on sackcloth and ashes. Then he went out into the middle of the city, crying out loudly and bitterly.","He went only as far as the king’s gate, for no one was to enter the king’s gate wearing sackcloth.","And in every province  where the king’s word and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, along with fasting and weeping and wailing. Many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes.","When Esther’s female attendants and her eunuchs came in and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments for Morʹde·cai to wear instead of his sackcloth, but he refused them.","At this Esther summoned Haʹthach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to serve her, and she ordered him to find out from Morʹde·cai what this meant and what was happening.","So Haʹthach went out to Morʹde·cai in the public square of the city in front of the king’s gate.","Morʹde·cai told him about everything that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haʹman had promised to pay to the king’s treasury for the Jews to be destroyed.","He also gave him a copy of the written decree that had been issued in Shuʹshan  for their annihilation. He was to show it to Esther and explain it to her and instruct her to go in to the king to beg for his favor and to plead directly with him in behalf of her people.","Haʹthach came back and told Esther what Morʹde·cai had said.","Esther replied to Haʹthach with instructions to tell Morʹde·cai:","“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces  are aware that if any man or woman goes into the king’s inner courtyard without being summoned, there is only one law that applies: He is to be put to death; he may live only if the king holds out to him the golden scepter. And I have not been summoned to the king now for 30 days.”","When Morʹde·cai was told what Esther had said,","he replied to Esther: “Do not imagine that because you are in the king’s household you are any more likely to escape than all the other Jews.","For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another source, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to your royal status?”","Then Esther replied to Morʹde·cai:","“Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shuʹshan  and fast in my behalf. Do not eat or drink for three days, night and day. I along with my female attendants will also fast. I will go in to the king, which is against the law, and if I am to perish, I will perish.”","So Morʹde·cai went his way and did all that Esther had instructed him to do."],["On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s house,  opposite the king’s house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance.","As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she gained his favor, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that  was in his hand. Esther then approached and touched the top of the scepter.","The king asked her: “What is the matter, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even to  the half of my kingdom, it will be granted you!”","Esther replied: “If it pleases the king, let the king along with Haʹman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”","So the king said to his men: “Tell Haʹman to come quickly, as Esther requests.” So the king and Haʹman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.","During the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther: “What is your petition? It will be granted you! And what is your request? Even to  the half of my kingdom, it will be done!”","Esther answered: “My petition and my request is,","If I have found favor with the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to act on my request, let the king and Haʹman come to the banquet that I will hold for them tomorrow; and tomorrow I will do as the king says.”","On that day Haʹman went out joyful and with a cheerful heart. But when Haʹman saw Morʹde·cai in the king’s gate and noticed that he did not rise and tremble in his presence, Haʹman was filled with rage against Morʹde·cai.","However, Haʹman restrained himself and went to his house. Then he sent for his friends and Zeʹresh his wife.","Haʹman boasted about his glorious wealth, his many sons, and how the king had promoted him and had exalted him over the princes and the servants of the king.","Haʹman added: “What is more, Queen Esther invited no one else but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared. I am also invited tomorrow to be with her and the king.","But all of this fails to satisfy me as long as I see Morʹde·cai the Jew sitting in the king’s gate.”","So Zeʹresh his wife and all his friends said to him: “Have a stake put up, 50 cubits  high. And in the morning tell the king that Morʹde·cai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to enjoy yourself at the banquet.” This suggestion seemed good to Haʹman, so he had the stake put up."],["That night the king could not sleep.  So he said to bring the book of the historical records of the times, and it was read to the king.","There it was found written what Morʹde·cai had reported concerning Big·thaʹna and Teʹresh, two court officials of the king, doorkeepers, who had plotted to do away with  King A·has·u·eʹrus.","The king asked: “What honor and recognition has been given to Morʹde·cai for this?” To this the king’s personal attendants said: “Nothing has been done for him.”","Later the king said: “Who is in the courtyard?” Now Haʹman had come into the outer courtyard of the king’s house  to speak to the king about having Morʹde·cai hanged on the stake that he had prepared for him.","The king’s attendants said to him: “It is Haʹman standing in the courtyard.” So the king said: “Have him come in.”","When Haʹman came in, the king said to him: “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haʹman  said in his heart: “Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?”","So Haʹman said to the king: “For the man whom the king wishes to honor,","let them bring royal attire that the king wears and a horse on which the king rides, with the royal headdress on its head.","Then let the attire and the horse be put into the charge of one of the king’s noble princes, and they should clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and have him ride on the horse in the public square of the city. They should call out before him: ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!’”","At once the king said to Haʹman: “Quick! Take the attire and the horse, and do what you just said for Morʹde·cai the Jew who is sitting in the king’s gate. Do not leave out anything that you have said.”","So Haʹman took the attire and the horse, and he clothed Morʹde·cai and made him ride in the public square of the city and called out before him: “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!”","Afterward Morʹde·cai returned to the king’s gate, but Haʹman hurried to his house, mourning with his head covered.","When Haʹman related to his wife Zeʹresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeʹresh said to him: “If Morʹde·cai, before whom you have started to fall, is of Jewish descent,  you will not prevail against him; you will surely fall before him.”","While they were still speaking with him, the king’s court officials arrived and quickly took Haʹman to the banquet that Esther had made."],["So the king and Haʹman came in to Queen Esther’s banquet.","The king said to Esther again on the second day during the banquet of wine: “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It will be granted you. And what is your request? Even to  the half of my kingdom, it will be done!”","Queen Esther answered: “If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life  be granted as my petition, and my people as my request.","For we have been sold, I and my people, to be annihilated, killed, and destroyed. If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent. But the distress is not proper, for it will be damaging to the king.”","King A·has·u·eʹrus then said to Queen Esther: “Who is this, and where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?”","Esther said: “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haʹman.”","The king rose up in a rage from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden, but Haʹman stood up to plead with Queen Esther for his life,  for he realized that the king was determined to punish him.","The king returned from the palace garden to the house of the wine banquet and saw that Haʹman had thrown himself on the couch where Esther was. The king exclaimed: “Is he also going to rape the queen in my own house?” As soon as these words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haʹman’s face.","Har·boʹna, one of the king’s court officials, now said: “Haʹman also prepared a stake for Morʹde·cai, whose report saved the king. It is standing at Haʹman’s house,  50 cubits  high.” At that the king said: “Hang him on it.”","So they hanged Haʹman on the stake that he had prepared for Morʹde·cai, and the king’s rage subsided."],["On that day King A·has·u·eʹrus gave the house of Haʹman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Morʹde·cai came in before the king, because Esther had revealed how he was related to her.","Then the king removed his signet ring that he had taken away from Haʹman and gave it to Morʹde·cai. And Esther put Morʹde·cai in charge of the house of Haʹman.","Moreover, Esther spoke again to the king. She fell down at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to undo the harm done by Haʹman the Agʹag·ite and his scheme against the Jews.","The king held the golden scepter out to Esther, at which Esther rose and stood before the king.","She said: “If it pleases the king and if I have his favor, and if it seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to annul the documents of that schemer Haʹman the son of Ham·me·daʹtha the Agʹag·ite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.","For how can I bear to look upon the disaster that will come upon my people, and how can I bear to see the destruction of my relatives?”","So King A·has·u·eʹrus said to Queen Esther and to Morʹde·cai the Jew: “Look! I have given the house of Haʹman to Esther and have had him hanged on the stake, because of his plot to attack  the Jews.","You may now write in the king’s name whatever you see fit in behalf of the Jews and seal it with the king’s signet ring, for a decree that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”","So the secretaries of the king were summoned at that time in the third month, that is, the month of Siʹvan,  on the 23rd day, and they wrote all that Morʹde·cai commanded to the Jews, as well as to the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces  from Inʹdi·a to E·thi·oʹpi·a, 127 provinces,  to each province  in its own script  and to each people in its own language and to the Jews in their own script  and language.","He wrote it in the name of King A·has·u·eʹrus and sealed it with the king’s signet ring and sent the written documents by the hand of couriers on horses; they rode on swift post-horses, bred for royal service.","In these documents the king granted permission to the Jews in all the different cities to gather together and defend their lives  and to annihilate, kill, and destroy any forces of any people or province  that might attack them, including women and children, and to seize their possessions.","This was to occur on the same day in all the provinces  of King A·has·u·eʹrus, on the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Aʹdar.","The text  of the document was to be issued as law throughout all the provinces.  It was to be proclaimed to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies.","The couriers riding the post-horses used in the royal service went out  urgently and speedily at the king’s order. The law was also issued in Shuʹshan  the citadel.","Now Morʹde·cai left the king’s presence in royal apparel of blue and white, wearing a great golden crown and a fine-fabric cloak of purple wool. And the city of Shuʹshan  shouted for joy.","For the Jews there was relief  and rejoicing and exultation and honor.","And in all the provinces  and all the cities, wherever the decree of the king and his law reached, the Jews were rejoicing and exulting, holding banquets and celebrations. Many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen upon them."],["On the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Aʹdar,  when the king’s word and his law were to be carried out, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, the opposite happened, and the Jews defeated those who hated them.","The Jews gathered together in their cities in all the provinces  of King A·has·u·eʹrus to lay hands on those seeking to harm them, and not a man could stand against them, for the dread of them had fallen upon all the peoples.","And all the princes of the provinces,  the satraps, the governors, and those handling the business of the king were supporting the Jews, for they were in fear of Morʹde·cai.","Morʹde·cai had become powerful in the king’s house,  and his fame was spreading throughout all the provinces,  because Morʹde·cai was steadily growing more powerful.","The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them; they did whatever they wanted to those hating them.","In Shuʹshan  the citadel  the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men.","Also, they killed Par·shan·daʹtha, Dalʹphon, As·paʹtha,","Po·raʹtha, A·daʹli·a, A·ri·daʹtha,","Par·mashʹta, Arʹi·sai, Arʹi·dai, and Vai·zaʹtha,","the ten sons of Haʹman the son of Ham·me·daʹtha, the enemy of the Jews. But after they killed them, they did not seize any plunder.","On that day the number of those killed in Shuʹshan  the citadel  was reported to the king.","The king said to Queen Esther: “In Shuʹshan  the citadel  the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the ten sons of Haʹman. What, then, have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces?  What is your petition now? It will be granted you. And what is your further request? It will be done.”","Esther replied: “If it pleases the king, let the Jews who are in Shuʹshan  be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today’s law; and let the ten sons of Haʹman be hanged on the stake.”","So the king gave orders for that to be done. A law was issued in Shuʹshan,  and the ten sons of Haʹman were hanged.","The Jews in Shuʹshan  gathered together again on the 14th day of the month of Aʹdar and killed 300 men in Shuʹshan,  but they did not seize any plunder.","The rest of the Jews in the provinces  of the king also gathered together and defended their lives.  They got rid of their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them; but they did not seize any plunder.","That was on the 13th day of the month  of Aʹdar, and they rested on the 14th day and made it a day of feasting and of rejoicing.","The Jews in Shuʹshan  gathered together on the 13th day and on the 14th day, and they rested on the 15th day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.","That is why the rural Jews inhabiting the cities of the outlying districts made the 14th day of the month of Aʹdar a day of rejoicing and feasting, a day of celebration, and a time to send portions of food to one another.","Morʹde·cai recorded these events and sent official letters to all the Jews in all the provinces  of King A·has·u·eʹrus, both near and far.","He instructed them to observe the 14th day of the month of Aʹdar, as well as the 15th day, each and every year,","because on those days the Jews rested from their enemies and in that month their grief was changed to rejoicing and their mourning to a day of celebration. They were to observe them as days of feasting and rejoicing and as a time to send portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor.","And the Jews agreed to continue the celebration that they had started and to do what Morʹde·cai wrote to them.","For Haʹman the son of Ham·me·daʹtha the Agʹag·ite, the enemy of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast Pur, that is, the Lot, to throw them into a panic and to destroy them.","But when Esther came in before the king, he gave orders in writing: “Let his evil scheme against the Jews come back on his own head”; and they hanged him and his sons on the stake.","That is why they called these days Puʹrim, after the name of the Pur.  Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter and what they saw concerning this matter and what had come upon them,","the Jews obligated themselves and their descendants and all those joining them to celebrate these two days without fail and to carry out what was written concerning them at the appointed time each and every year.","These days were to be remembered and observed in every generation, by each family, each province,  and each city; and these days of Puʹrim should not cease among the Jews, and their commemoration should not come to an end among their descendants.","Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abʹi·ha·il, and Morʹde·cai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm a second letter about Puʹrim.","He sent official letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces,  the realm of A·has·u·eʹrus, in words of peace and truth","to confirm the observance of the days of Puʹrim at their appointed times, just as Morʹde·cai the Jew and Queen Esther had instructed them to do and just as they had obligated themselves  and their descendants to carry out, including the fasting and supplication.","And the command of Esther confirmed these matters concerning Puʹrim, and it was recorded in a book."],["King A·has·u·eʹrus imposed forced labor on the land and the islands of the sea.","And all his powerful and mighty accomplishments, as well as the detailed account of Morʹde·cai’s greatness to which the king exalted him, are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Meʹdi·a and Persia?","For Morʹde·cai the Jew was second only to King A·has·u·eʹrus. He was great  among the Jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers, working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of  all their descendants."]],"Job":[["There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.  He was an upright man of integrity;  he feared God and shunned what was bad.","Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.","His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle,  and 500 donkeys,  along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.","Each of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day.  They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.","After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For  Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do.","Now the day came when the sons of the true God  entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them.","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.”","And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of  my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity,  fearing God and shunning what is bad.”","At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?","Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land.","But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.”","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand.  Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence  of Jehovah.","Now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,","a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them","when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”","While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God  fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”","While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”","While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house.","Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”","At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down","and said:","In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong."],["Afterward the day came when the sons of the true God  entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them to take his station before Jehovah.","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.”","And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of  my servant Job?

A man will give everything that he has for his life.","But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.”","Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! He is in your hand!  Only do not take his life!”","So Satan went out from the presence  of Jehovah and struck Job with painful boils  from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.","And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he was sitting among the ashes.","Finally his wife said to him: “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!”","But he said to her: “You are talking like one of the senseless women.

So he lived among the people.","While Jeremiah was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard, the word of Jehovah came to him, saying:","“Go and tell Eʹbed-melʹech the E·thi·oʹpi·an, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: “Here I am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good, and in that day you will see it happen.”’","“‘But I will rescue you in that day,’ declares Jehovah, ‘and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.’","“‘For I will surely provide you with escape, and you will not fall by the sword. You will have your life  as a spoil,  because you trusted in me,’ declares Jehovah.”"],["The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah after Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the guard let him go free from Raʹmah. He had taken him there bound with handcuffs, and he was among all the exiles of Jerusalem and of Judah who were being deported to Babylon.","Then the chief of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him: “Jehovah your God foretold this calamity against this place,","and Jehovah has brought it  about just as he said, because you people sinned against Jehovah and did not obey his voice. That is why this has happened to you.","Now I am releasing you today from the handcuffs that were on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if you do not want to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See! The entire land is before you. Go wherever you choose.”","While Jeremiah still had not turned back, Neb·uʹzar·adʹan said: “Return to Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you choose.”","So Jeremiah went to Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam at Mizʹpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.","In time all the army chiefs who were in the field with their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam over the land and that he had appointed him over the men, women, and children from the poor people of the land who had not been deported to Babylon.","So they came to Ged·a·liʹah at Mizʹpah.

Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.","As for me, I will stay in Mizʹpah to represent you to  the Chal·deʹans who come to us. But you should gather wine, summer fruits, and oil and put them in your storage containers and settle in the cities that you have taken over.”","And all the Jews who were in Moʹab, Amʹmon, and Eʹdom, as well as those who were in all the other lands, also heard that the king of Babylon had let a remnant stay in Judah and that he had appointed over them Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan.","So all the Jews began returning from all the places to which they had been dispersed, and they came into the land of Judah, to Ged·a·liʹah at Mizʹpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in very great quantity.","Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs who were in the field came to Ged·a·liʹah at Mizʹpah.","They said to him: “Do you not know that Baʹa·lis, the king of the Amʹmon·ites, has sent Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah to kill you?”  But Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam did not believe them.","Then Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah secretly told Ged·a·liʹah in Mizʹpah: “I want to go and strike down Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah, and no one will know. Why should he kill you,  and why should all the people of Judah who have gathered to you be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish?”","But Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam said to Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah: “Do not do this, for what you are saying concerning Ishʹma·el is a lie.”"],["In the seventh month Ishʹma·el son of Neth·a·niʹah son of E·lishʹa·ma, who was of the royal line  and one of the principal men of the king, came with ten other men to Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam at Mizʹpah. As they were eating a meal together in Mizʹpah,","Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah and the ten men who were with him rose up and struck down Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan with the sword.

Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah took them captive and went off to cross over to the Amʹmon·ites.","When Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs who were with him heard about all the evil that Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah had done,","they took all the men and went off to fight against Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah, and they found him by the great waters  in Gibʹe·on.","All the people who were with Ishʹma·el rejoiced when they saw Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs with him.","Then all the people whom Ishʹma·el had taken captive from Mizʹpah turned around and went back with Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah.","But Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah and eight of his men escaped from Jo·haʹnan and went to the Amʹmon·ites.","Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs who were with him took with them the rest of the people from Mizʹpah, those whom they had rescued from Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah after he had struck down Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam.

If you did not warn him, he will die for his sin and his righteous acts will not be remembered, but I will ask his blood back from you.","But if you have warned the righteous one not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely keep alive because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life.”","The hand of Jehovah came upon me there, and he said to me: “Get up, go to the valley plain, and I will speak with you there.”","So I got up and went to the valley plain, and look! the glory of Jehovah was there, like the glory that I saw by the river Cheʹbar, and I fell facedown.","Then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet, and he spoke to me and said:","As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you with them so that you cannot go out among them.","And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will become mute, unable to reprove them, because they are a rebellious house.","But when I speak with you I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.’ Let the one listening listen, and let the one refusing to listen refuse, because they are a rebellious house."],["“And you, son of man, take a brick and put it in front of you. Engrave on it a city—Jerusalem.","Lay siege to it, build a siege wall against it, raise up a siege rampart against it, set up camps against it, and surround it with battering rams.","Take an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city. Then set your face against it, and it will be under siege; you are to besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.","“Then you should lie on your left side and lay the guilt of the house of Israel on yourself.  You will carry their guilt for the number of days that you lie on your side.","And I will impose on you 390 days, corresponding to the years of their guilt, and you will carry the guilt of the house of Israel.","And you must complete them.","And you will turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and you must prophesy against it.","“Look! I will tie you with ropes so that you cannot turn from your one side to your other  side until you have completed the days of your siege.","“And you should take wheat, barley, broad beans, lentils, millet, and spelt and put them in one container and make them into bread for yourself. For the number of the days that you are lying on your side, 390 days, you will eat it.","You will weigh out and eat 20 shekels  of food per day. You will eat it at set times.","“And you will drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin.  You will drink it at set times.","“You will eat it as you would a round barley loaf; you will bake it before their eyes, using dried human excrement as fuel.”","Jehovah went on to say: “This is how the Israelites will eat their bread—unclean—among the nations where I will disperse them.”","I then said: “Not that, Sovereign Lord Jehovah! From my youth until now, I have  not been defiled by eating meat from an animal found dead or a torn animal, and no unclean  meat has entered my mouth.”","So he said to me: “All right, I will allow you to use cattle manure instead of human excrement, and you will bake your bread over it.”","He then said to me: “Son of man, here I am cutting off the food supply  in Jerusalem, and with great anxiety they will eat their bread ration by weight, and in horror they will drink their water ration by measure.","This will happen so that lacking bread and water, they may look in shock at one another and waste away because of their error."],["“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword for yourself to use as a barber’s razor. Shave your head and your beard, and then take scales to weigh and divide the hair into portions.","You will burn a third of it in the fire inside the city when the days of the siege are completed. Then you will take another third and strike it with the sword all around the city,  and the last third you will scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them.","“You must also take a few strands of them and wrap them up in the folds  of your garment.","And take some more of them and throw them into the fire and incinerate them. From this a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, with lands all around her.","But she has rebelled against my judicial decisions and my statutes, acting more wickedly than the nations and the lands all around her. For they have rejected my judicial decisions, and they did not walk in my statutes.’","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because you were more troublesome than the nations all around you and you did not walk in my statutes or carry out my judicial decisions but, instead, you followed the judicial decisions of the nations all around you,","this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O city, and I myself will execute judgment in your midst before the eyes of the nations.","I will do in you what  I have never done before, and the likes of which I will not do again, because of all your detestable practices.","“‘“So fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers, and I will execute judgment among you and scatter all the rest of you in every direction.”’","“‘Therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘because it was my sanctuary that you defiled with all your disgusting idols and with all your detestable practices, I will also reject  you; my eye will not feel sorry, and I will show no compassion.","A third of you will die by the pestilence  or perish in your midst by famine. Another third will fall all around you by the sword. And I will scatter the last third in every direction,  and I will draw a sword to chase after them.","Then my anger will come to an end, and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be satisfied. And they will have to know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion, when I have finished unleashing my wrath against them.","“‘I will make you a devastated place and an object of reproach among the surrounding nations and in the eyes of everyone passing by.","You will become an object of reproach and scorn, a warning example and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgment on you in anger and in wrath and with furious punishments. I, Jehovah, have spoken.","“‘I will send against them the deadly arrows of famine to destroy them. The arrows that I send will bring you to ruin. I will make the famine worse for you by cutting off your food supply.","I will send against you famine and vicious wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children. Pestilence and bloodshed will overwhelm you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.’”"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, turn your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.","You must say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the mountains, to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys: “Look! I will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.","Your altars will be demolished, your incense stands will be broken, and I will throw your slain ones down before your disgusting idols.","I will throw the carcasses of the people of Israel before their disgusting idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.","In all the places where you dwell, the cities will be devastated and the high places will be demolished and will lie devastated.

They will realize that I was brokenhearted over their unfaithful  heart that turned away from me and at their eyes that are lusting  after their disgusting idols. They will be ashamed of and loathe all the evil and detestable things they have done.","They will have to know that I am Jehovah and that my threats to bring this calamity on them were not empty.”’","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Clap your hands and stamp your foot and bemoan all the evil and detestable things done by the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.","The one far away will die by pestilence, the one nearby will fall by the sword, and whoever escapes these and is left remaining will die by famine; and I will fully unleash my wrath against them.","And you will have to know that I am Jehovah, when their slain lie among their disgusting idols, all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every luxuriant tree, and under the branches of big trees where they have made fragrant offerings  to appease all their disgusting idols.","I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate, and all their dwelling places will become more desolate than the wilderness near Dibʹlah. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“As for you, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the land of Israel: ‘An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.","The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds.","My eye will not feel sorry for you; nor will I feel compassion, for I will bring upon you the results of your own ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your detestable deeds.

A calamity, a unique calamity, is coming.","An end is coming; the end will come; it will rouse itself  against you. Look! It is coming.","Your turn  has come, you who inhabit the land.

I will bring on you the results of your ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your own detestable deeds. And you will have to know that I, Jehovah, am striking you.","“‘Look, the day! Look, it is coming! Your turn  has come; the rod has blossomed and presumptuousness has sprouted.","Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. Neither they nor their wealth nor their crowds nor their prominence  will survive.","The time will come, the day will arrive.

But you will see detestable things that are even more terrible.”","Then he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and when I looked, I saw a hole in the wall.","He said to me: “Son of man, please bore through the wall.” So I bored through the wall, and I saw an entryway.","He said to me: “Go in and see the evil, detestable things that they are doing here.”","So I went in and looked, and I saw all sorts of images of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the disgusting idols  of the house of Israel; they were carved on the wall all around.","And 70 of the elders of the house of Israel were standing before them, with Ja·az·a·niʹah the son of Shaʹphan standing among them. Each one had his censer in his hand, and the perfumed cloud of incense was ascending.","He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed?  For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’”","And he went on to say to me: “You will see detestable things that are even more terrible that they are doing.”","So he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Jehovah, and there I saw women sitting and weeping over the god Tamʹmuz.","And he further said to me: “Do you see this, O son of man? You will see detestable things that are even more terrible than these.”","So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah. There at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men with their backs to the temple of Jehovah and their faces to the east; they were bowing down to the sun in the east.","He said to me: “Son of man, do you see this? Is it a trivial thing for the house of Judah to do these detestable things, to fill the land with violence and  keep offending me? Here they are thrusting out the branch  to my nose.","So I will act in rage. My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. Even though they cry out loudly in my ears, I will not hear them.”"],["He then called out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: “Summon those who will bring punishment on the city, each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand!”","I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon for smashing in his hand; and there was one man among them clothed in linen, with a secretary’s inkhorn  at his waist, and they came in and stood beside the copper altar.","Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen, at whose waist was the secretary’s inkhorn.","Jehovah said to him: “Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.”","And to the others he said in my hearing: “Go through the city after him and strike. Do not let your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion.","Old man, young man, virgin, little child, and women you should kill off completely. But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. You should start from my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders who were in front of the house.","Then he said to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down people in the city.","While they were striking them down, I alone was left, and I fell facedown and cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of Israel while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem?”","So he said to me: “The error of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of corruption. For they say, ‘Jehovah has left the land, and Jehovah is not seeing.’","But as for me, my eye will not feel sorry; nor will I show compassion. The consequences of their way I will bring down on their own head.”","Then I saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word, saying: “I have done just as you have commanded me.”"],["As I was watching, I saw above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubs something like a sapphire stone appearing above them, and its appearance resembled a throne.","Then he said to the man clothed in linen: “Enter between the wheelwork, under the cherubs, and fill both your hands with burning coals from between the cherubs and toss them over the city.” So he entered as I watched.","The cherubs were standing to the right of the house when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.","And the glory of Jehovah rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and the house gradually became filled with the cloud,  and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.","And the sound of the wings of the cherubs could be heard in the outer courtyard, like the sound of God Almighty when he speaks.","Then he commanded the man clothed in linen: “Take fire from between the wheelwork, from between the cherubs,” and he entered and stood beside the wheel.","Then one of the cherubs stretched his hand out toward the fire that was between the cherubs. He took some and put it into both hands of the one clothed in linen, who now took it and went out.","The cherubs had what looked like the form of human hands under their wings.","As I was watching, I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one wheel beside each cherub, and the wheels appeared to glow like chrysʹo·lite stone.","As for their appearance, the four of them were alike, looking as though a wheel were within a wheel.","When they moved, they could go in any of the four directions without turning, because they would go to the place where the head would face without turning.","Their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, the wheels of all four of them, were full of eyes all around.","As regards the wheels, I heard a voice that called to them, “Wheelwork!”","Each one  had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, the second face was the face of a man,  the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle.","And the cherubs would rise—they were the same living creatures  that I had seen at the river Cheʹbar—","and when the cherubs moved, the wheels would move alongside them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not turn or move from their side.","When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, they would rise with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures  was in them.","Then the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold of the doorway of the house and stood still over the cherubs.","The cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth as I watched. The wheels were also alongside them when they departed. They stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.","These were the living creatures  that I had seen under the God of Israel at the river Cheʹbar, so I came to know that they were cherubs.","All four had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings.","And the appearances of their faces were like the faces I had seen by the river Cheʹbar. They would each go straight forward."],["And a spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, the gate that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate I saw 25 men, and among them were Ja·az·a·niʹah the son of Azʹzur and Pel·a·tiʹah the son of Be·naiʹah, princes of the people.","Then He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who are scheming evil and giving wicked advice in  this city.","They are saying, ‘Is it not the time for building houses? The city  is the cooking pot,  and we are the flesh.’","“So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.”","Then the spirit of Jehovah came upon me, and he said to me: “Say, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “What you have said is correct, O house of Israel, and I know what you are thinking.","You have caused many to die in this city, and you have filled her streets with the dead.”’”","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The dead bodies that you have strewn about the city are the flesh, and the city is the cooking pot. But you yourselves will be taken out of it.’”","“‘A sword you have feared, and a sword I will bring against you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.","‘I will bring you out of her and give you into the hand of foreigners and execute judgment on you.","You will fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.","The city will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be the flesh within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel,","and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. For you did not walk in my regulations and carry out my judgments, but you have acted in harmony with the judgments of the nations around you.’”","As soon as I prophesied, Pel·a·tiʹah the son of Be·naiʹah died, and I fell facedown and cried with a loud voice: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to exterminate the remaining ones of Israel?”","The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, your brothers, those of your brothers with the right of repurchase, along with the entire house of Israel, have been told by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Keep far away from Jehovah. The land is ours; it has been given to us as a possession.’","Therefore say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Although I have removed them far away among the nations and I have scattered them among the lands, for a little while I will become a sanctuary for them in the lands to which they have gone.”’","“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “I will also collect you from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.","And they will return there and remove from it all its disgusting things and detestable practices.","And I will give them a unified heart,  and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,","in order that they may walk in my statutes and observe my judgments and obey them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.”’","“‘“But as for those whose hearts are set to continue in their disgusting things and their detestable practices, I will bring the consequences of their way  upon their head,” declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’”","The cherubs now lifted up their wings, and the wheels were close to them, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.","Then the glory of Jehovah ascended from the city and stopped over the mountain to the east of the city.","A spirit then lifted me up—through a vision by the spirit of God—and brought me to the exiled people in Chal·deʹa. Then the vision that I had seen left me.","And I began to tell the exiled people all the things that Jehovah had shown me."],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house.

Perhaps they will take notice, even though they are a rebellious house.","Bring out your luggage packed for going into exile during the day while they are watching, and then in the evening while they are watching, you should leave like someone being taken into exile.","“While they are watching, bore a hole in the wall, and carry your belongings out through it.","While they are watching, put your belongings on your shoulder and carry them out in the darkness. Cover your face so that you cannot see the ground, for I am making you a sign to the house of Israel.”","I did just as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my luggage as luggage for going into exile, and in the evening I bored a hole through the wall by hand.

I will take pleasure in them there, and I will require your contributions and the firstfruits of your offerings, all your holy things.","Because of the pleasing  aroma, I will take pleasure in you when I bring you out from the peoples and collect you together from the lands to which you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified among you before the eyes of the nations.’","“‘And you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I bring you to the land of Israel, into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers.","And there you will remember your conduct and all your deeds by which you defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves  because of all the bad things that you did.","Then you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I deal with you for the sake of my name, not according to your wicked conduct or according to your corrupted dealings, O house of Israel,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”","And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, turn your face in the direction of the southern quarter and proclaim to the south, and prophesy to the forest of the field of the south.","Say to the forest of the south, ‘Hear the word of Jehovah.

It will certainly come—it will take place,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”","The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Say, ‘A sword!

He shakes the arrows. He consults his idols;  he examines the liver.","The divination in his right hand is pointed toward Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to give the word for slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to throw up a siege rampart, to build a siege wall.","But it will seem like false divination in the eyes of those  who had sworn oaths to them. But he remembers their guilt and will capture them.","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘You have caused your own guilt to be remembered by exposing your transgressions and causing your sins to be seen in all your actions. Now that you have been remembered, you will be taken by force.’","“But your day has come, O fatally wounded, wicked chieftain of Israel, the time of your final punishment.","This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Remove the turban, and take off the crown.

I clap my hands in disgust at the dishonest gain you have made and over the acts of bloodshed in your midst.","Will your courage  endure and your hands remain strong in the days when I take action against you?

I will bring the consequences of their way on their own head,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, there were two women who were the daughters of the same mother.","They became prostitutes in Egypt; from their youth they engaged in prostitution. Their breasts were squeezed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled.","Their names were O·hoʹlah,  the older one, and her sister O·hoʹli·bah.  They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, O·hoʹlah is Sa·marʹi·a, and O·hoʹli·bah is Jerusalem.","“O·hoʹlah began to prostitute herself while she belonged to me. She lusted after her passionate lovers, her neighbors the As·syrʹi·ans.","They were governors clothed in blue and deputy rulers—all desirable young men mounted on their horses.","She continued to prostitute herself with all the choicest sons of As·syrʹi·a, and she defiled herself with the disgusting idols  of those she lusted after.","She did not abandon the prostitution she practiced in Egypt, for in her youth they had lain down with her, and they fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust  on her.","So I gave her into the hand of her passionate lovers, the sons of As·syrʹi·a, after whom she had lusted.","They exposed her nakedness and seized her sons and daughters, and they killed her with a sword. She became notorious among women, and they executed judgment against her.","“When her sister O·hoʹli·bah saw it, her lust became even more depraved, and her prostitution was worse than that of her sister.","She lusted after her neighbors the sons of As·syrʹi·a, the governors and deputy rulers who were clothed in splendor and mounted on horses—all desirable young men.","When she defiled herself, I saw that both of them had followed the same course.","But she kept adding to her acts of prostitution. She saw men carved on the wall, images of Chal·deʹans  carved in vermilion,","wearing belts around their waist, with flowing turbans on their heads, having the appearance of warriors, all of them depicting Babylonians, born in the land of the Chal·deʹans.","She began to lust after them as soon as she saw them, and she sent messengers to them in Chal·deʹa.","So the sons of Babylon kept coming to her bed of lovemaking, and they defiled her with their lust.  After she was defiled by them, she  turned away from them in disgust.","“When she went on brazenly engaging in prostitution and exposing her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I  had turned away from her sister in disgust.","And she kept increasing her acts of prostitution, calling to mind the days of her youth when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt.","She lusted after them like the concubines of men whose male members are like those of a donkey and whose genitals are like those of a horse.","You yearned for the obscene conduct of your youth in Egypt when they fondled your bosom, the breasts of your youth.","“Therefore, O·hoʹli·bah, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Here I am stirring up your lovers whom you  turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every direction,","the sons of Babylon and all the Chal·deʹans, the men of Peʹkod and Shoʹa and Koʹa, along with all the sons of As·syrʹi·a. All of them are desirable young men, governors and deputy rulers, warriors and handpicked,  all mounted on horses.","They will attack you with rumbling war chariots and wheels and with a great assembly of troops, with large shield and buckler  and helmet. They will take up positions all around you, and I will authorize them to pass judgment, and they will judge you as they see fit.","I will express my indignation against you, and they will deal with you in their rage. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and those of you who remain will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and your daughters, and those of you who remain will be consumed by fire.","They will strip off your garments and seize your beautiful jewelry.","I will put an end to your obscene conduct and your prostitution, which started in the land of Egypt. You will stop looking at them, and you will remember Egypt no more.’","“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Here I am about to hand you over to those you hate, those you  turned away from in disgust.","They will deal with you in hatred and take away all you have toiled for and leave you naked and exposed. The shameful nakedness of your immorality and your obscene conduct and your prostitution will be exposed.","These things will be done to you because you chased after the nations like a prostitute, because you defiled yourself with their disgusting idols.","You have followed the same course as your sister, and I will put her cup into your hand.’","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:","You will be overcome by  drunkenness and grief,","You will have to drink it and drain it dry and gnaw on its earthenware fragments","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because you have forgotten me and have completely disregarded me,  you will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and your acts of prostitution.’”","Jehovah then said to me: “Son of man, will you pronounce judgment on O·hoʹlah and O·hoʹli·bah and confront them with their disgusting practices?","They have committed adultery,  and there is blood on their hands. Not only have they committed adultery with their disgusting idols, but they have also made their sons whom they bore to me pass through the fire as food for their idols.","Moreover, this is what they have done to me: They defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my sabbaths.","After they slaughtered their sons as sacrifices to their disgusting idols, they came into my sanctuary to profane it on that very day. That is what they did inside my own house.","They even sent a messenger for men to come from far away. When they were coming, you washed yourself and painted your eyes and adorned yourself with ornaments.","And you sat down on a magnificent couch with a table set in front of it, on which you put my incense and my oil.","The sound of a carefree crowd of men was heard there, among whom were drunkards brought in from the wilderness. They put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.","“Then I said regarding her who was worn out with adultery: ‘Now she will keep committing her prostitution.’","So they kept going in to her, just as one goes to a prostitute. That is how they went in to O·hoʹlah and to O·hoʹli·bah, the women of obscene conduct.","But righteous men will render to her the appropriate judgment for adultery and bloodshed; for adulteresses is what they are, and they have blood on their hands.","“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘An army will be brought against them to make them an object of horror and something to plunder.","The army will hurl stones at them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire.","I will put an end to the obscene conduct in the land, and all the women will learn a lesson and not copy your obscene conduct.","They will bring on you the consequences of your obscene conduct and of your sins with your disgusting idols; and you will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’”"],["The word of Jehovah again came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying:","“Son of man, record this date,  this very day. The king of Babylon has begun his attack against Jerusalem on this very day.","And relate a proverb  concerning the rebellious house, and say concerning them:","4  Put pieces of meat into it, every good piece,","5  Take the choicest sheep of the flock, and stack the logs all around under the pot.","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:","7  For its blood is within it; she poured it out on the bare rock.","8  To stir up rage for executing vengeance,","“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:","Heap on the logs and kindle the fire,","Set the empty pot on the coals to make it hot","It is frustrating and exhausting,","“‘Your uncleanness was due to your obscene conduct. I tried to cleanse you, but you would not become clean from your uncleanness. You will not become clean until my rage against you subsides.","I myself, Jehovah, have spoken. It will come to pass. I will act without holding back, without sorrow, without regret. They will judge you according to your ways and your dealings,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”","And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“Son of man, in a single blow I am about to take away your dear one from you. You should not mourn;  nor should you weep or shed tears.","Groan in silence, and do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put on your sandals. You should not cover over the mustache,  and do not eat the bread brought to you by others.”","And I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. So I did in the morning just as I had been commanded.","The people were saying to me: “Will you not tell us what these things you are doing have to do with us?”","I replied to them: “The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying,","‘Tell the house of Israel: “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says, ‘I am about to profane my sanctuary, the source of your great pride, the thing dear to you and the desire of your heart.

I judged them according to their way and according to their dealings.","But when they came to those nations, people profaned my holy name by saying about them, ‘These are  the people of Jehovah, but they had to leave his land.’","So I will show concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they have gone.”","“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Not for your sakes am I acting, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you profaned among the nations where you have gone.”’","‘I will certainly sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you profaned among them; and the nations will have to know that I am Jehovah,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘when I am sanctified among you before their eyes.","I will take you from the nations and gather you back from all the lands and bring you into your land.","I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will become clean; I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your disgusting idols.","I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit inside you. I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh.","I will put my spirit inside you, and I will cause you to walk in my regulations, and you will observe and carry out my judicial decisions.","Then you will dwell in the land that I gave to your forefathers, and you will be my people and I will be your God.’","“‘I will save you from all your uncleanness and summon the grain and make it abound, and I will not bring famine upon you.","I will make the fruitage of the tree and the produce of the field abound, so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.","Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves because of your guilt and your detestable practices.","But know this: I am not doing this for your sakes,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘Instead, be ashamed and feel humiliated because of your ways, O house of Israel.’","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘In the day that I cleanse you from all your guilt, I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the ruins to be rebuilt.","The desolate land that was lying desolate for everyone passing by to see will be cultivated.","And people will say: “The desolate land has become like the garden of Eʹden, and the cities that were in ruins and desolate and torn down are now fortified and inhabited.”","And the nations that are left remaining around you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have built what was torn down, and I have planted what was desolate. I myself, Jehovah, have spoken, and I have done it.’","“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will also let the house of Israel ask me to do this for them: I will multiply their people like a flock.","Like the flock of holy ones, like the flock of Jerusalem  during her festivals, the cities that were in ruins will become full of flocks of people; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’”"],["The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and by his spirit Jehovah took me and set me down in the middle of the valley  plain, and it was full of bones.","He had me pass all around them, and I saw that there were very many bones lying in the valley plain, and they were very dry.","He asked me: “Son of man, can these bones come to life?” To that I said: “Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you are the one who knows.”","So he said to me: “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, ‘You dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah:","“‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to these bones: “I will cause breath to enter you, and you will come to life.","I will put sinews and flesh on you, and I will cover you with skin and put breath in you, and you will come to life; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.”’”","Then I prophesied just as I had been commanded. As soon as I prophesied, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones began to come together, bone to bone.","Then I saw sinews and flesh come on them, and skin covered over them. But there was still no breath in them.","He then said to me: “Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “From the four winds come in, O wind,  and blow upon these people who were killed, so that they may come to life.”’”","So I prophesied just as he commanded me, and breath  came into them, and they began to live and to stand on their feet, an extremely large army.","Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Here they are saying, ‘Our bones are dry, and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’","So prophesy and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “I will open your graves and raise you up from your graves, my people, and bring you to the land of Israel.","And you will have to know that I am Jehovah when I open your graves and when I raise you up out of your graves, O my people.”’","‘I will put my spirit in you and you will come to life, and I will settle you on your land; and you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have spoken and I have done it,’ declares Jehovah.”","The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying:","“And you, son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the people of Israel who are with him.’  Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Eʹphra·im, and all the house of Israel who are with him.’","Then bring them close to each other so that they become just one stick in your hand.","When your people  say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean?’","tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Eʹphra·im, and the tribes of Israel who are with him, and I will join them to the stick of Judah; and I will make them one stick, and they will become one in my hand.”’","The sticks that you write on should be in your hand for them to see.","“Then tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “I will take the Israelites from among the nations where they have gone, and I will collect them together from every direction and bring them  to their land.","I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations; nor will they be divided any longer into two kingdoms.","They will no longer defile themselves with their disgusting idols  and their detestable practices and all their transgressions.

He had a flax cord and a measuring reed  in his hand, and he was standing in the gateway.","The man said to me: “Son of man, look closely, listen carefully, and pay attention  to everything I show you, for that is why you were brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything that you see.”","I saw a wall surrounding the outside of the temple.  In the man’s hand was a measuring reed six cubits long (to each cubit, a handbreadth was added).  He began to measure the wall, and its thickness was one reed and its height was one reed.","Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps. When he measured the threshold of the gate, its width was one reed, and the width of the other threshold was also one reed.","Each guard chamber was one reed long and one reed wide, and there were five cubits between the guard chambers. The threshold of the gate beside the porch of the gate facing the interior measured one reed.","He measured the porch of the gate toward the interior, and it was one reed.","He then measured the porch of the gate,  which was eight cubits; and he measured its side pillars, which were two cubits; and the porch of the gate was on the side facing the interior.","There were three guard chambers on each side of the east gate. The three were the same size, and the side pillars on either side were the same size.","Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, which was 10 cubits; and the length of the gate was 13 cubits.","The partitioned area in front of the guard chambers on either side was one cubit. The guard chambers on both sides were six cubits each.","He then measured the gate from the roof of the one guard chamber  to the roof of the other, and it was 25 cubits wide; one entrance was across from the other entrance.","Then he measured the side pillars, which were 60 cubits tall, as well as the side pillars in the gates all around the courtyard.","From the front of the entrance of the gate to the front of the porch on the inner side of the gate was 50 cubits.","There were windows with narrowing frames  for the guard chambers and for their side pillars inside the gate on each side. The interior of the porches also had windows on each side, and there were palm-tree figures on the side pillars.","He then brought me into the outer courtyard, and I saw dining rooms  and a pavement around the courtyard. There were 30 dining rooms on the pavement.","The pavement at the side of the gates corresponded to the length of the gates—this was the lower pavement.","Then he measured the distance  from the front of the lower gate to the perimeter of the inner courtyard. It was 100 cubits on the east and on the north.","The outer courtyard had a gate facing north, and he measured its length and its width.","There were three guard chambers on each side. Its side pillars and porch had the same measurements as the first gate. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.","Its windows, its porch, and its palm-tree figures were the same size as those of the east gate. People could reach it by climbing seven steps, and its porch was in front of them.","There was a gate in the inner courtyard opposite the north gate and one opposite the east gate. He measured the distance from gate to gate, and it was 100 cubits.","Next he brought me toward the south, and I saw a gate on the south side. He measured its side pillars and its porch, and they were the same size as the others.","There were windows on each side of it and its porch, like the other windows. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.","There were seven steps leading up to it, and its porch was in front of them.

There were also two tables on the other side of the porch of the gate.","There were four tables on each side of the gate—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.","The four tables for the whole burnt offering were of hewn stone. They were one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one cubit high. On them were kept the implements used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.","Shelves, one handbreadth wide, were attached all around the interior walls; and the flesh of the gift offerings would be placed on the tables.","Outside the inner gate were the dining rooms for the singers; they were in the inner courtyard near the north gate, facing south. Another dining room was near the east gate, facing north.","He said to me: “This dining room that faces south is for the priests who are responsible for the services in the temple.","The dining room that faces north is for the priests who are responsible for the service of the altar. They are the sons of Zaʹdok, those from the Levites who are assigned to approach Jehovah to minister to him.”","Then he measured the inner courtyard. It was 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide, foursquare. The altar was in front of the temple.","Then he brought me into the porch of the temple, and he measured the side pillar of the porch, and it was five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. The width of the gate was three cubits on one side and three cubits on the other side.","The porch was 20 cubits long and 11  cubits wide. People would reach it by climbing the  steps. There were pillars by the side posts, one on each side."],["Then he brought me into the outer sanctuary,  and he measured the side pillars; they were six cubits  wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side.","The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the sidewalls  of the entrance were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, which was 40 cubits, and its width, 20 cubits.","He then went inside  and measured the side pillar of the entrance, and it was two cubits thick, and the entrance was six cubits wide. The sidewalls of the entrance were  seven cubits.","Next he measured the room facing the outer sanctuary, and it was 20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide. And he said to me: “This is the Most Holy.”","Then he measured the wall of the temple, and it was six cubits thick. The side chambers around the temple were four cubits wide.","The side chambers were three stories high, one on top of the other, with 30 chambers on each story. There were ledges around the wall of the temple that served as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports did not go into the wall of the temple itself.","On both sides of the temple was a winding passage  that widened as it ascended to the upper chambers. The width increased from story to story as one ascended from the lowest story to the uppermost story by passing through the middle story.","I saw that there was a raised platform all around the temple, and the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six cubits to the corner.","The width of the outside wall of the side chambers was five cubits. There was an open space  alongside the structure of the side chambers that was part of the temple.","Between the temple and the dining rooms  was an area that was 20 cubits wide on each side.","There was an entrance between the side chambers and the open space on the north side and another entrance on the south side. The width of the open space was five cubits all around.","The building that was on the west facing the open area was 70 cubits wide and 90 cubits long; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around.","He measured the temple, and it was 100 cubits long. The open area, the building,  and its walls were also 100 cubits long.","The width of the front of the temple facing east and the open area was 100 cubits.","He measured the length of the building that faced the open area in the rear, along with its galleries on both sides, and it was 100 cubits.","as well as the thresholds, the windows with narrowing frames, and the galleries that were in those three areas.  Near the threshold were wood panels from the floor up to the windows; and the windows were covered.","Measurements were taken above the entrance and in the inner temple and on the outside and on the entire wall all around.","It had carved cherubs and palm-tree figures, with each palm tree between two cherubs, and each cherub had two faces.","The human face was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion  was toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved this way throughout the entire temple.","From the floor to the area above the entrance were carved cherubs and palm-tree figures on the wall of the sanctuary.","The doorposts  of the sanctuary were square. In front of the holy place  was something like","a wooden altar that was three cubits high and two cubits long. It had corner posts, and its base  and its sides were made of wood. He then said to me: “This is the table that is before Jehovah.”","The outer sanctuary and the holy place each had two doors.","The doors had two swinging leaves, two leaves for each door.","There were carved cherubs and palm-tree figures on the doors of the sanctuary, like those on the walls. There was also a wooden overhang  on the front of the porch on the outside.","There were also windows with narrowing frames and palm-tree figures along both sides of the porch, as well as along the side chambers of the temple and the overhangs."],["Then he led me to the outer courtyard toward the north. And he brought me to the dining-room block that was next to the open area, north of the adjoining building.","Its length at the north entrance was 100 cubits,  and it was 50 cubits wide.","It was located between the inner courtyard, which was 20 cubits wide, and the pavement of the outer courtyard. Its galleries faced each other and were three stories high.","Before the dining rooms  was an inner walkway 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long,  and their entrances were to the north.","The upper dining rooms of the building were narrower than those in the lower and middle stories, because the galleries took up more of their space.","For they were three stories high, but they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. That is why more floor space was taken away from them than from the lower and middle stories.","The outer stone wall near the dining rooms toward the outer courtyard that faced the other dining rooms was 50 cubits long.","For the length of the dining rooms that were toward the outer courtyard was 50 cubits, but for those facing the sanctuary, it was 100 cubits.","The dining rooms had an entryway on the east side leading up to them from the outer courtyard.","There were also dining rooms inside  the stone wall of  the courtyard toward the east, near the open area and the building.","There was a walkway before them like that of the northern dining rooms. They were the same length and width, and they had the same exits and layouts. Their entrances","were like the entrances of the dining rooms that were toward the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the walkway, before the adjacent stone wall toward the east, where one could enter.","Then he said to me: “The dining rooms of the north and the dining rooms of the south that are next to the open area are the holy dining rooms where the priests who are approaching Jehovah eat the most holy offerings. There they place the most holy offerings, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy.","When the priests enter, they should not go out of the holy place to the outer courtyard without first removing the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They will clothe themselves with other garments in order to approach the areas permitted to the people.”","When he finished measuring the inner temple area,  he led me out by way of the gate that faces east, and he measured the entire area.","He measured the eastern side with the measuring reed.  According to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths from one side to the other.","He measured the northern side, and according to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths.","He measured the southern side, and according to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths.","He went around to the western side. He measured 500 reed lengths with the measuring reed.","He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall all around it that was 500 reeds long and 500 reeds wide, to make a division between what is holy and what is for common use."],["Then he led me to the gate that is facing east.","There I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters; and the earth was illuminated by his glory.","What I saw was like the vision I had seen when I  came to bring the city to ruin, and it appeared to be like what I had seen near the river Cheʹbar; and I fell with my face to the ground.","Then the glory of Jehovah entered the temple  through the gate facing the east.","A spirit then raised me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and I saw that the temple had become full of the glory of Jehovah.","Then I heard someone speaking to me out of the temple, and the man came and stood beside me.","He said to me:","By putting their threshold next to my threshold and their doorpost  beside my doorpost, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by the detestable things they did, so I exterminated them in my anger.","Now let them put their spiritual prostitution and the carcasses of their kings far away from me, and I will dwell among them forever.","“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they will feel ashamed because of their errors, and they should study its plan.","If they feel ashamed of all they have done, you should make known to them the ground plan of the temple, its arrangement, its exits, and its entrances.

The entire territory all around the top of the mountain is most holy. Look!

This is your dream, and these are the visions of your head as you lay on your bed:","“As for you, O king, on your bed your thoughts turned to what is to take place in the future, and the Revealer of secrets has made known to you what is to happen.","As for me, this secret was not revealed to me because I have greater wisdom than anyone living; rather, it was to make the interpretation known to the king so that you may know the thoughts in your heart.","“You, O king, were watching, and you saw an immense image.  That image, which was huge and extremely bright, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying.","The head of that image was of fine gold, its chest and its arms were of silver, its abdomen and its thighs were of copper,","its legs were of iron, and its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.","You looked on until a stone was cut out, not by hands, and it  struck the image on its feet of iron and of clay and crushed them.","At that time the iron, the clay, the copper, the silver, and the gold were, all together, crushed and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a large mountain, and it filled the whole earth.","“This is the dream, and we will now tell the king its interpretation.","You, O king—the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the might, the strength, and the glory,","and into whose hand he has given men wherever they may dwell, as well as the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, and whom he has made ruler over all of them—you yourself are the head of gold.","“But after you another kingdom will rise, inferior to you; then another kingdom, a third one, of copper, that will rule over the whole earth.","“As for the fourth kingdom, it will be strong like iron. For just as iron crushes and pulverizes everything else, yes, like iron that shatters, it will crush and shatter all of these.","“And just as you saw the feet and the toes to be partly of clay of a potter and partly of iron, the kingdom will be divided, but some of the hardness of iron will be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with soft clay.","And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.","Just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay, they will be mixed with the people;  but they will not stick together, one to the other, just as iron does not mix with clay.","“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever,","just as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The Grand God has made known to the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”","Then King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar fell down with his face to the ground before Daniel and paid homage to him. And he gave the order to offer a present and incense to him.","The king said to Daniel: “Truly your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a Revealer of secrets, because you were able to reveal this secret.”","The king then elevated Daniel and gave him many fine gifts, and he made him the ruler over all the province  of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.","And at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go over the administration of the province  of Babylon, but Daniel served in the king’s court."],["Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar the king made an image  of gold that was 60 cubits  high and 6 cubits  wide. He set it up on the plain of Duʹra in the province  of Babylon.","Then  King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces  to come to the inauguration of the image that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up.","So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces  assembled for the inauguration of the image that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up. And they stood in front of the image that Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up.","The herald loudly proclaimed: “You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and language groups,","that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar has set up.","Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.”","So when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, and all the other musical instruments, all the peoples, nations, and language groups fell down and worshipped the image of gold that King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had set up.","Now at that time some of the Chal·deʹans came forward and accused  the Jews.","They said to King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar: “O king, may you live on forever.","You, O king, gave the command that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments should fall down and worship the image of gold;","and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.","But there are certain Jews whom you appointed to administer the province  of Babylon: Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go. These men have paid no regard to you, O king. They are not serving your gods, and they refuse to worship the image of gold that you have set up.”","Then Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, in a furious rage, ordered Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go to be brought in. So these men were brought in before the king.","Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar said to them: “Is it really true, Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, that you are not serving my gods and that you refuse to worship the image of gold that I have set up?","Now when you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image that I have made, fine. But if you refuse to worship, you will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who can rescue you out of my hands?”","Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go answered the king: “O Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.","If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O king, and to rescue us from your hand.","But even if he does not, let it be  known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up.”","Then Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar became so furious with Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go that the expression of his face changed  toward them, and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual.","He ordered some of the mighty men from his army to bind Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.","So these men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, garments, caps, and all their other clothing, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.","Because the king’s command was so harsh and the furnace was exceptionally hot, the men who took up Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go were the ones killed by the flames of the fire.","But these three men, Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.","King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar then became frightened and quickly rose up and said to his high officials: “Did we not tie up three men and throw them into the fire?” They answered the king: “Yes, O king.”","He said: “Look! I see four men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed, and the fourth one looks like a son of the gods.”","Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace and said: “Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, you servants of the Most High God, step out and come here!” Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go stepped out from the midst of the fire.","And the satraps, prefects, governors, and the high officials of the king who were assembled there saw that the fire had had no effect on  the bodies of these men; not a hair of their heads had been singed, their cloaks looked no different, and there was not even the smell of fire on them.","Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar then declared: “Praised be the God of Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go, who sent his angel and rescued his servants. They trusted in him and went against the command of the king and were willing to die  rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.","I am therefore issuing an order that any people, nation, or language group that says anything against the God of Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go should be dismembered, and their houses should be turned into public latrines;  for there is no other god who is able to rescue like this one.”","The king then promoted  Shaʹdrach, Meʹshach, and A·bedʹne·go in the province  of Babylon."],["“From King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar to all the peoples, nations, and language groups dwelling in all the earth: May your peace abound!","I am pleased to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed toward me.","How great are his signs, and how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rulership is for generation after generation.","“I, Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace.","I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay on my bed, the images and visions of my head frightened me.","So I issued an order to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream.","“At that time the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the Chal·deʹans,  and the astrologers came in. When I told them what the dream was, they could not make its interpretation known to me.","At last there came in before me Daniel, whose name is Bel·te·shazʹzar after the name of my god and in whom there is the spirit of the holy gods, and I told him the dream:","“‘O Bel·te·shazʹzar the chief of the magic-practicing priests, I well know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret is too difficult for you. So explain to me the visions I saw in my dream and its interpretation.","“‘In the visions of my head while on my bed, I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was enormous.","The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.","Its foliage was beautiful, and its fruit was abundant, and there was food on it for all. Beneath it the beasts of the field would seek shade, and on its branches the birds of the heavens would dwell, and all creatures  would feed from it.","“‘As I viewed the visions of my head while on my bed, I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from the heavens.","He called out loudly: “Chop down the tree, cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit! Let the beasts flee from beneath it, and the birds from its branches.","But leave the stump with its roots  in the ground, with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let its portion be with the beasts among the vegetation of the earth.","Let its heart be changed from that of a human, and let it be given the heart of a beast, and let seven times pass over it.","This is by the decree of watchers, and the request is by the word of the holy ones, so that people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he gives it to whomever he wants, and he sets up over it even the lowliest of men.”","“‘This was the dream that I, King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, saw; now you, O Bel·te·shazʹzar, tell its interpretation, for all the other wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the interpretation known to me. But you are able to do so, because the spirit of holy gods is in you.’","“At that time Daniel, whose name is Bel·te·shazʹzar, was alarmed for a moment, and his thoughts began to frighten him.","“‘The tree that you saw that grew great and became strong, whose top reached the heavens and was visible to all the earth,","which had beautiful  foliage, abundant fruit, and food for all, beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell and on whose branches the birds of the heavens would reside,","it is you, O king, because you have grown great and become strong, and your grandeur has grown and reached to the heavens, and your rulership to the ends of the earth.","“‘And the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from the heavens, who was saying: “Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots  in the ground, with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field. And let the dew of the heavens make it wet, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over it.”","This is the interpretation, O king; it is the decree of the Most High that must befall my lord the king.","You will be driven away from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field, and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls; and you will become wet with the dew of the heavens, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants.","“‘But because they said to leave the stump of the tree with its roots,  your kingdom will be yours again after you come to know that the heavens are ruling.","Therefore, O king, may my counsel be acceptable to you. Turn away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor. It may be that your prosperity will be extended.’”","All of this befell King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar.","Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.","The king was saying: “Is this not Babylon the Great that I myself have built for the royal house by my own strength and might and for the glory of my majesty?”","While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, a voice came down from the heavens: “To you it is being said, O King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, ‘The kingdom has gone away from you,","and from mankind you are being driven away. With the beasts of the field your dwelling will be, and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants.’”","At that moment the word was fulfilled on Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar. He was driven away from mankind, and he began to eat vegetation just like bulls, and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair grew long just like eagles’ feathers and his nails were like birds’ claws.","“At the end of that time I, Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, looked up to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me; and I praised the Most High, and to the One living forever I gave praise and glory, because his rulership is an everlasting rulership and his kingdom is for generation after generation.","All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing, and he does according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth. And there is no one who can hinder him  or say to him, ‘What have you done?’","“At that time my understanding returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. My high officials and nobles eagerly sought me out, and I was restored to my kingdom, and even more greatness was added to me.","“Now I, Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar, am praising and exalting and glorifying the King of the heavens, because all his works are truth and his ways are just, and because he is able to humiliate those who are walking in pride.”"],["As regards King Bel·shazʹzar, he held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in front of them.","While under the influence of the wine, Bel·shazʹzar gave an order to bring in the vessels of gold and silver that his father Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his concubines and his secondary wives could drink from them.","Then they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his concubines and his secondary wives drank from them.","They drank wine, and they praised the gods of gold and silver, of copper, iron, wood, and stone.","At that very moment the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace opposite the lampstand, and the king could see the back of the hand as it was writing.","Then the king turned pale  and his thoughts terrified him, and his hips shook and his knees began to knock together.","The king called out loudly to summon the conjurers, the Chal·deʹans,  and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon: “Any man who reads this writing and tells me its interpretation will be clothed with purple, a gold necklace will be placed around his neck, and he will rule as the third one in the kingdom.”","Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known the interpretation to the king.","So King Bel·shazʹzar was very frightened and his face turned pale; and his nobles were perplexed.","Because of the words of the king and his nobles, the queen entered the banqueting hall. The queen said: “O king, may you live on forever. Do not let your thoughts terrify you, nor let your face turn pale.","There is a man  in your kingdom who has the spirit of holy gods. In the days of your father, enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of gods were found in him. King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar your father appointed him as chief of the magic-practicing priests, conjurers, Chal·deʹans,  and astrologers; your father did this, O king.","For Daniel, whom the king named Bel·te·shazʹzar, had an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams, to explain riddles, and to solve knotty problems.  Now let Daniel be summoned, and he will tell you the interpretation.”","So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked Daniel: “Are you Daniel of the exiles of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah?","I have heard concerning you that the spirit of gods is in you and that enlightenment and insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you.","Now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me to read this writing and to make its interpretation known to me, but they are not able to tell the interpretation of the message.","But I have heard concerning you that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve knotty problems.  Now if you are able to read the writing and to make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple, a gold necklace will be placed around your neck, and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.”","Daniel then replied to the king: “You may keep your gifts and give your presents to others. However, I will read the writing to the king and make known its interpretation to him.","As for you, O king, the Most High God granted to Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar your father the kingdom and greatness and honor and majesty.","Because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, nations, and language groups trembled with fear before him. Whomever he wanted, he killed or let live, and whomever he wanted, he exalted or humiliated.","But when his heart became haughty and his spirit became hardened, so that he acted presumptuously, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and his dignity was taken away from him.","He was driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was given vegetation to eat just like bulls, and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens, until he came to know that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he sets up over it whomever he wants.","“But you, his son Bel·shazʹzar, have not humbled your heart, although you knew all of this.","Instead, you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens, and you had them bring you the vessels of his house. Then you and your nobles, your concubines and your secondary wives drank wine from them and praised gods of silver and gold, of copper, iron, wood, and stone, gods that see nothing and hear nothing and know nothing. But you have not glorified the God in whose hand is your breath and all your ways.","So the hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed.","And this is the writing that was inscribed: MEʹNE, MEʹNE, TEʹKEL, and PARʹSIN.","“This is the interpretation of the words: MEʹNE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end.","“TEʹKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found lacking.","“PEʹRES, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.”","Then Bel·shazʹzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with purple and placed a gold necklace around his neck; and they heralded concerning him that he was to become the third ruler in the kingdom.","That very night Bel·shazʹzar the Chal·deʹan king was killed.","And Da·riʹus the Mede received the kingdom; he was about 62 years old."],["It seemed good to Da·riʹus to appoint 120 satraps over the whole kingdom.","Over them were three high officials, one of  whom was Daniel; and the satraps would report to them, so that the king would not suffer loss.","Now Daniel was distinguishing himself over the other high officials and the satraps, for there was an extraordinary spirit in him, and the king intended to elevate him over the entire kingdom.","At that time the high officials and the satraps were seeking to find some grounds for accusation against Daniel respecting matters of state,  but they could find no grounds for accusation or anything corrupt, for he was trustworthy and no negligence or corruption could be found in him.","These men then said: “We will find in this Daniel no grounds for accusation at all, unless we find it against him in the law of his God.”","So these high officials and satraps went in as a group to the king, and they said to him: “O King Da·riʹus, may you live on forever.","All the royal officials, prefects, satraps, high royal officers, and governors have consulted together to establish a royal decree and to enforce a ban,  that for 30 days whoever makes a petition to any god or man except to you, O king, should be thrown into the lions’ pit.","Now, O king, may you establish the decree and sign it, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be annulled.”","So King Da·riʹus signed the decree and the ban.","But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house, which had the windows of his roof chamber open toward Jerusalem. And three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed and offered praise before his God, as he had regularly done prior to this.","At that time those men burst in and found Daniel petitioning and pleading for favor before his God.","So they approached the king and reminded him about the royal ban: “Did you not sign a ban stating that for 30 days any man who makes a petition to any god or man except to you, O king, should be thrown into the lions’ pit?” The king replied: “The matter is well-established according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be annulled.”","They immediately said to the king: “Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judah, has paid no regard to you, O king, nor to the ban that you signed, but three times a day he is praying.”","As soon as the king heard this, he was greatly distressed, and he tried to think of a way to rescue Daniel; and until the sun set he made every effort to save him.","Finally those men went in as a group to the king, and they said to the king: “Take note, O king, that the law of the Medes and the Persians is that any ban or decree that the king establishes cannot be changed.”","So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the pit of lions. The king said to Daniel: “Your God whom you are continually serving will rescue you.”","Then a stone was brought and placed over the entrance  of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet ring of his nobles, so that nothing could be changed with regard to Daniel.","The king then went to his palace. He passed the night fasting and refused any entertainment,  and he could not sleep.","Finally at the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ pit.","As he got near the pit, he called out to Daniel with a sad voice. The king asked Daniel: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are continually serving been able to rescue you from the lions?”","Daniel immediately said to the king: “O king, may you live on forever.","My God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not harmed me, for I was found innocent before him; nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.”","The king was overjoyed, and he commanded that Daniel be lifted up out of the pit. When Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, he was completely unharmed, because he had trusted in his God.","The king then gave an order, and the men who had accused  Daniel were brought, and they were thrown into the lions’ pit, along with their sons and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.","Then King Da·riʹus wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups dwelling throughout the earth: “May you have abundant peace!","I am issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom, people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God and he endures forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rulership  is eternal.","He rescues, saves, and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.”","So this Daniel prospered in the kingdom of Da·riʹus and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian."],["In the first year of King Bel·shazʹzar of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters.","Daniel declared:","And four huge beasts came out of the sea, each different from the others.","“The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man, and it was given the heart of a man.","“And look! another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Get up, eat much flesh.’","“After this I kept watching, and look! another beast, like a leopard, but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. And the beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.","“After this I kept watching in the visions of the night, and I saw a fourth beast, fearsome and terrifying and unusually strong, and it had large iron teeth. It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it trampled down with its feet. It  was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it, and it had ten horns.","While I considered the horns, look! another horn, a small one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it. And look! there were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and there was a mouth speaking arrogantly.","“I kept watching until thrones were set in place and the Ancient of Days sat down. His clothing was white like snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool. His throne was flames of fire; its wheels were a burning fire.","A stream of fire was flowing and going out from before him. A thousand thousands kept ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The Court took its seat, and books were opened.","“I kept watching at that time because of the sound of the arrogant  words that the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed and it was given over to be burned in the fire.","But as for the rest of the beasts, their rulerships were taken away, and their lives were prolonged for a time and a season.","“I kept watching in the visions of the night, and look! with the clouds of the heavens, someone like a son of man was coming; and he gained access to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him up close before that One.","And to him there were given rulership, honor, and a kingdom, that the peoples, nations, and language groups should all serve him. His rulership is an everlasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom will not be destroyed.","“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me because the visions of my head frightened me.","I went near to one of those who were standing there to ask him about the true meaning of this. So he replied and made known to me the interpretation of these things.","“‘These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will stand up from the earth.","But the holy ones of the Supreme One will receive the kingdom, and they will possess the kingdom forever, yes, forever and ever.’","“Then I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others; it was extraordinarily fearsome, with iron teeth and copper claws, and it was devouring and crushing, and trampling down what was left with its feet;","and about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly  and whose appearance was bigger than that of the others.","“I kept watching as that horn made war on the holy ones, and it was prevailing against them,","until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Supreme One, and the appointed time arrived for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.","“This is what he said: ‘As for the fourth beast, there is a fourth kingdom that will come to be on the earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour all the earth and will trample it down and crush it.","As for the ten horns, ten kings will rise up out  of that kingdom; and still another one will rise up after them, and he will be different from the first ones, and he will humiliate three kings.","He will speak words against the Most High, and he will continually harass the holy ones of the Supreme One. He will intend to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.","But the Court sat, and they took away his rulership, in order to annihilate him and to destroy him completely.","“‘And the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One. Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all rulerships will serve and obey them.’","“This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts alarmed me greatly, so that I turned pale;  but I kept the matter in my own heart.”"],["In the third year of the kingship of King Bel·shazʹzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me previously.","I saw the vision, and as I watched I was in Shuʹshan  the citadel,  which is in the province  of Eʹlam; I viewed the vision, and I was next to the watercourse of Uʹlai.","As I raised my eyes, look! there was a ram standing before the watercourse, and it had two horns. The two horns were tall, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up later.","I saw the ram making thrusts to the west and to the north and to the south, and no wild beasts could stand before it, and there was no one who could provide rescue from its power.  It did as it pleased and exalted itself.","As I kept watching, look! there was a male goat coming from the west  crossing the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes.","It was coming toward the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing before the watercourse; it was running toward it in a powerful rage.","I saw it closing in on the ram, and it was filled with bitterness toward it. It struck down the ram and broke its two horns, and the ram was powerless to stand up to it. It threw the ram to the ground and trampled it down, and there was no one to rescue it from its power.","Then the male goat exalted itself exceedingly, but as soon as it became mighty, the great horn was broken; then four conspicuous horns came up instead of the one, toward the four winds of the heavens.","Out of one of them came another horn, a small one, and it grew very great toward the south and toward the east  and toward the Decoration.","It grew so great that it reached all the way to the army of the heavens, and it caused some of the army and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down.","It exalted itself even against the Prince of the army, and from him the constant feature  was taken away, and the established place of his sanctuary was thrown down.","And an army  was given over, together with the constant feature,  because of transgression; and it kept throwing truth to the earth, and it acted and had success.","And I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one speaking: “How long will the vision of the constant feature  and of the transgression causing desolation continue, to make both the holy place and the army things to trample on?”","So he said to me: “Until 2,300 evenings and mornings; and the holy place will certainly be restored to its right condition.”","While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and seeking to understand it, suddenly I saw standing in front of me someone who appeared to be a man.","Then I heard the voice of a man in the midst of the Uʹlai, and he called out: “Gaʹbri·el, make that one understand what he saw.”","So he came near to where I was standing, but when he came I was so terrified that I fell facedown. He said to me: “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”","But while he was speaking with me, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground. So he touched me and made me stand up where I had been standing.","Then he said: “Here I am causing you to know what will happen in the final part of the denunciation, because it is for the appointed time of the end.","“The two-horned ram that you saw stands for the kings of Meʹdi·a and Persia.","The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first king.","As for the horn that was broken, so that four stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.","“And in the final part of their kingdom, as the transgressors act to a completion,  a fierce-looking king who understands ambiguous sayings  will stand up.","His power will become great, but not through his own power. He will bring ruin in an extraordinary way,  and he will be successful and act effectively. He will bring mighty ones to ruin, also the people made up of the holy ones.","And by his cunning he will use deception to succeed; and in his heart he will exalt himself; and during a time of security  he will bring many to ruin. He will even stand up against the Prince of princes, but he will be broken without human hand.","“What was said in the vision about the evenings and the mornings is true, but you must keep the vision secret, for it refers to a time many days from now.”","As for me, Daniel, I felt exhausted and I was sick for some days. Then I got up and carried out the king’s work; but I was numbed by what I had seen, and no one could understand it."],["In the first year of Da·riʹus the son of A·has·u·eʹrus—a descendant of the Medes who had been made king over the kingdom of the Chal·deʹans—","in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, discerned by the books  the number of years mentioned in the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet to fulfill the  desolation of Jerusalem, namely, 70 years.","So I turned my face to Jehovah the true God, entreating him in prayer, along with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.","I prayed to Jehovah my God and made confession and said:","we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled; and we have deviated from your commandments and your judgments.","We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, our forefathers, and all the people of the land.","To you, O Jehovah, belongs righteousness, but to us belongs shame  as is the case today, to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those nearby and far away, in all the lands to which you dispersed them because they acted unfaithfully toward you.","“O Jehovah, to us belongs shame,  to our kings, our princes, and our forefathers, because we have sinned against you.","To Jehovah our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him.","We have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God by following his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets.","All Israel has overstepped your Law and turned away by not obeying your voice, so that you poured out on us the curse and the sworn oath written about in the Law of Moses the servant of the true God, for we have sinned against Him.","He has carried out his words that he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled over us,  by bringing great calamity on us; nothing has ever been done under the whole heavens such as what was done in Jerusalem.","Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us, yet we have not begged for the favor  of Jehovah our God by turning away from our error and by showing insight into your truth.","“So Jehovah kept watchful and brought calamity on us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all the works that he has done; yet we have not obeyed his voice.","“Now, O Jehovah our God, the One who brought your people out of the land of Egypt by a mighty hand and made a name for yourself down to this day, we have sinned and acted wickedly.","O Jehovah, according to all your righteous acts, please, may your anger and wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the errors of our forefathers, Jerusalem and your people are an object of reproach to all those around us.","And now listen, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his entreaties, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for your own sake, O Jehovah.","Incline your ear, O my God, and hear! Do open your eyes and see our desolate condition and the city that has been called by your name; for we are not entreating you because of our righteous acts but because of your great mercy.","O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. O Jehovah, do  pay attention and act! Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.”","While I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request for favor before Jehovah my God concerning the holy mountain of my God,","yes, while I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gaʹbri·el, whom I had previously seen in the vision, came to me when I was extremely weary at about the time of the evening gift offering.","And he gave me understanding, saying:","When you began your entreaty the word went out, and I have come to report it to you, because you are someone very precious.  So consider the matter and understand the vision.","“There are 70 weeks  that have been determined for your people and your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, to finish off sin, to make atonement for error, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and the prophecy,  and to anoint the Holy of Holies.","You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Mes·siʹah  the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks. She will be restored and rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in times of distress.","“And after the 62 weeks, Mes·siʹah will be cut off,  with nothing for himself.","“And he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week, he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease."],["In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was called by the name Bel·te·shazʹzar; and the message was true, and it was about a great conflict. And he understood the message and was given understanding about what he had seen.","In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning for three full weeks.","I ate no rich food, and no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks.","On the 24th day of the first month, while I was on the bank of the great river, the Tiʹgris,","I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen, and around his waist was a belt of gold from Uʹphaz.","His body was like chrysʹo·lite, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.","Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see the vision. However, a great trembling seized them, and they ran away and hid.","Then I was left by myself, and when I saw this great vision, there was no power left in me and my dignified appearance left me and I lost all strength.","Then I heard the sound of him speaking; but when I heard him speaking, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground.","But then a hand touched me, and it stirred me to get up on my hands and knees.","Then he said to me:","He then said to me: “Do not be afraid, O Daniel. Your words have been heard from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and to humbling yourself before your God, and I have come because of your words.","But the prince of the royal realm of Persia stood in opposition to me for 21 days. But then Miʹcha·el,  one of the foremost princes,  came to help me; and I remained there beside the kings of Persia.","I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days, because it is a vision yet for the days to come.”","Now when he spoke these words to me, I turned my face to the ground and became speechless.","Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and said to the one who stood in front of me: “My lord, I am shuddering because of the vision, and I have no strength.","So how can my lord’s servant speak with my lord? For now I have no strength, and there is no breath left in me.”","The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me.","Then he said: “Do not be afraid, O very precious  man. May you have peace. Be strong, yes, be strong.” As he spoke with me I was strengthened and I said: “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”","Then he said: “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will go back to fight with the prince of Persia. When I leave, the prince of Greece will come.","However, I will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth. There is no one strongly supporting me in these things but Miʹcha·el, your prince."],["“As for me, in the first year of Da·riʹus the Mede, I stood up to strengthen and fortify him.","What I will tell you now is the truth:","“And a mighty king will stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do as he pleases.","But when he has stood up, his kingdom will be broken and be divided toward the four winds of the heavens, but not to his descendants  and not like the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be uprooted and go to others besides these.","“And the king of the south will become strong, that is, one of his princes; but one will prevail against him and will rule  with extensive dominion, greater than that one’s ruling power.","“After some years they will make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north in order to make an equitable arrangement.  But she will not retain the power of her arm; and he will not stand, nor his arm; and she will be given up, she and those bringing her in, and the one who caused her birth, and the one making her strong in those times.","And one from the sprout of her roots will stand up in his position, and he will come to the army and come against the fortress of the king of the north and will take action against them and prevail.","Also with their gods, with their metal images,  with their desirable  articles of silver and of gold, and with captives, he will come to Egypt. For some years he will stand off from the king of the north,","who will come against the kingdom of the king of the south, but will go back to his own land.","“As for his sons, they will prepare for war and assemble a vast, great army. He will certainly advance and sweep through like a flood. But he will go back, and he will wage war all the way to his fortress.","“And the king of the south will become bitter and will go out and fight with him, that is, with the king of the north; and he will muster a large crowd, but the crowd will be given into that one’s hand.","And the crowd will be carried away. His heart will become exalted, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; but he will not make use of his strong position.","“And the king of the north will return and muster a crowd larger than the first; and at the end of the times, after some years, he will surely come with a large army and with many resources.","In those times many will stand up against the king of the south.","“And the king of the north will come and throw up a siege rampart and capture a fortified city. And the arms  of the south will not stand, nor will his select men; and they will have no power to stand.","The one coming against him will do as he pleases, and no one will stand before him. He will stand in the land of the Decoration,  and ability to exterminate will be in his hand.","He will set his face  to come with the full force of his kingdom, and there will be equitable terms  with him; and he will act effectively. As regards the daughter of women, it will be granted to him to bring her to ruin. And she will not stand, and she will not continue to be his.","He will turn his face back to the coastlands and will capture many. And a commander will make the reproach from him cease for himself, so that his reproach will not be. He will make it turn back on that one.","Then he will turn his face back to the fortresses of his own land, and he will stumble and fall, and he will not be found.","“And there will stand up in his position one who causes an exactor  to pass through the splendid kingdom, but in a few  days he will be broken, though not in anger nor in warfare.","“And there will stand up in his position a despised  one, and they will not give him the majesty of the kingdom; and he will come in during a time of security  and take hold of the kingdom by means of smoothness.","And the arms  of the flood will be swept away on account of him, and they will be broken; as will be the Leader of the covenant.","And because of their alliance with him, he will carry on deception and rise up and become mighty by means of a little nation.","During a time of security  he will come into the richest parts  of the province  and do what his fathers and their fathers have not done. Plunder and spoil and goods he will distribute among them; and against fortified places he will plot his schemes, but only for a time.","“And he will muster his power and his heart against the king of the south with a large army, and the king of the south will prepare himself for the war with an exceedingly large and mighty army. And he will not stand, because they will plot schemes against him.","And those eating his delicacies will bring his downfall.","“As regards these two kings, their heart will be inclined to do what is bad, and they will sit at one table speaking lies to each other. But nothing will succeed, because the end is yet for the time appointed.","“And he will go back to his land with a great amount of goods, and his heart will be against the holy covenant. He will act effectively and go back to his land.","“At the time appointed he will return and come against the south. But this time will not be as it was before,","for the ships of Kitʹtim will come against him, and he will be humbled.","And arms  will stand up, proceeding from him; and they will profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and remove the constant feature.","“And those who act wickedly against the covenant, he will lead into apostasy by means of smooth words.  But the people who know their God will prevail and act effectively.","And those having insight among the people will impart understanding to the many. And they will be made to stumble by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plundering, for some days.","But when they are made to stumble, they will be given a little help; and many will join with them by means of smooth speech.","And some of those having insight will be made to stumble, in order to do a refining work because of them and to do a cleansing and a whitening until the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.","“The king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god; and against the God of gods he will speak astonishing things. And he will prove successful until the denunciation comes to a finish; because what is determined must take place.","He will show no regard for the God of his fathers; nor will he show regard for the desire of women or for any other god, but he will magnify himself over everyone.","But instead  he will give glory to the god of fortresses; to a god that his fathers did not know he will give glory by means of gold and silver and precious stones and desirable  things.","He will act effectively against the most fortified strongholds, along with  a foreign god. He will give great glory to those who give him recognition,  and he will make them rule among many; and the ground he will apportion out  for a price.","“In the time of the end the king of the south will engage with him in a pushing,  and against him the king of the north will storm with chariots and horsemen and many ships; and he will enter into the lands and sweep through like a flood.","He will also enter into the land of the Decoration,  and many lands will be made to stumble. But these are the ones that will escape out of his hand: Eʹdom and Moʹab and the main part of the Amʹmon·ites.","And he will keep thrusting out his hand against the lands; and as regards the land of Egypt, she will not escape.","And he will rule over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the desirable  things of Egypt. And the Libʹy·ans and the E·thi·oʹpi·ans will be at his steps.","“But reports out of the east  and out of the north will disturb him, and he will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction.","And he will plant his royal  tents between the grand sea and the holy mountain of Decoration;  and he will come all the way to his end, and there will be no helper for him."],["“During that time Miʹcha·el  will stand up,  the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people.  And there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time your people will escape, everyone who is found written down in the book.","And many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up, some to everlasting life and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.","“And those having insight will shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven, and those bringing the many to righteousness like the stars, forever and ever.","“As for you, Daniel, keep the words secret, and seal up the book until the time of the end.

Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew into the territory of Galʹi·lee.","And he came and settled in a city named Nazʹa·reth, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Naz·a·reneʹ.”"],["In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Ju·deʹa,","saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”","This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: “A voice of one calling out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah!  Make his roads straight.’”","Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.","Then the people of Jerusalem and all Ju·deʹa and all the country around the Jordan were going out to him,","and they were baptized  by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.","When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: “You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?","Therefore, produce fruit that befits repentance.","Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.","The ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.","I, for my part, baptize you with water because of your repentance, but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to take off. That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire.","His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”","Then Jesus came from Galʹi·lee to the Jordan to John,  in order to be baptized by him.","But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”","Jesus replied to him: “Let it be this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him.","After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him.","Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”"],["Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.","After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, he felt hungry.","And the Tempter approached and said to him: “If you are a son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”","But he answered: “It is written: ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s  mouth.’”","Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him on the battlement  of the temple","and said to him: “If you are a son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: ‘He will give his angels a command concerning you,’ and, ‘They will carry you on their hands, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.’”","Jesus said to him: “Again it is written: ‘You must not put Jehovah  your God to the test.’”","Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.","And he said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.”","Then Jesus said to him: “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘It is Jehovah  your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”","Then the Devil left him, and look! angels came and began to minister to him.","Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galʹi·lee.","Further, after leaving Nazʹa·reth, he came and took up residence in Ca·perʹna·um beside the sea in the districts of Zebʹu·lun and Naphʹta·li,","so as to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:","“O land of Zebʹu·lun and land of Naphʹta·li, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galʹi·lee of the nations!","The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose on them.”","From that time on, Jesus began preaching and saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”","Walking alongside the Sea of Galʹi·lee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.","And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”","At once they abandoned their nets and followed him.","Going on from there, he saw two others who were brothers, James the son of Zebʹe·dee and his brother John. They were in the boat with Zebʹe·dee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.","At once they left the boat and their father and followed him.","Then he went throughout the whole of Galʹi·lee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.","And the report about him spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all those who were suffering with various diseases and torments, those who were demon-possessed and epileptic and paralyzed, and he cured them.","Consequently, large crowds followed him from Galʹi·lee and De·capʹo·lis  and Jerusalem and Ju·deʹa and from the other side of the Jordan."],["When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him.","Then he opened his mouth and began teaching them, saying:","“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need,  since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.","“Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.","“Happy are the mild-tempered,  since they will inherit the earth.","“Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.","“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.","“Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.","“Happy are the peacemakers,  since they will be called sons of God.","“Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.","“Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake.","Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.","“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltiness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.","“You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when located on a mountain.","People light a lamp and set it, not under a basket,  but on the lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.","Likewise, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.","“Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill.","Truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place.","Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens.","For I say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.","“You heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You  must not murder, but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’","However, I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·henʹna.","“If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,","leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away. First make your peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.","“Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent, while you are with him on the way there, so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.","I say to you for a fact, you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin.","“You heard that it was said: ‘You must not commit adultery.’","But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.","If, now, your right eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into Ge·henʹna.","Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in Ge·henʹna.","“Moreover, it was said: ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’","However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality,  makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.","“Again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times: ‘You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’","However, I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;","nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.","Do not swear by your head, since you cannot turn one hair white or black.","Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes, your ‘No,’ no, for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one.","“You heard that it was said: ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’","However, I say to you: Do not resist the one who is wicked, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.","And if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment, let him also have your outer garment;","and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile,  go with him two miles.","Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow  from you.","“You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’","However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you,","so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.","For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing?","And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing?","You must accordingly be perfect,  as your heavenly Father is perfect."],["“Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them; otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.","So when you make gifts of mercy,  do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.","But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,","so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.","“Also, when you pray, do not act like the hypocrites, for they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the main streets to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.","But when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.","When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words.","So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.","“You must pray, then, this way:","Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.","Give us today our bread for this day;","and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.","And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver  us from the wicked one.’","“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;","whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","“When you fast, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces  so they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.","But you, when fasting, put oil on your head and wash your face,","so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.","“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.","Rather, store up for  yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.","For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.","“The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is focused,  your whole body will be bright.","But if your eye is envious,  your whole body will be dark. If the light that is in you is really darkness, how great that darkness is!","“No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.","“On this account I say to you: Stop being anxious about your lives  as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not life  mean more than food and the body than clothing?","Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?","Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit  to his life span?","Also, why are you anxious about clothing? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin;","but I tell you that not even Solʹo·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.","Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith?","So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to wear?’","For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.","“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.","So never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles."],["“Stop judging that you may not be judged;","for with the judgment you are judging, you will be judged, and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you.","Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye?","Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the straw from your eye,’ when look! a rafter is in your own eye?","Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother’s eye.","“Do not give what is holy to dogs nor throw your pearls before swine, so that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open.","“Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you;","for everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.","Indeed, which one of you, if his son asks for bread, will hand him a stone?","Or if he asks for a fish, he will not hand him a serpent, will he?","Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give  good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him!","“All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them. This, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.","“Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it;","whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.","“Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep’s covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves.","By their fruits you will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?","Likewise, every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit.","A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit.","Every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.","Really, then, by their fruits you will recognize those men.","“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.","Many will say to me in that day: ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’","And then I will declare to them: ‘I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!’","“Therefore, everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does them will be like a discreet man who built his house on the rock.","And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded on the rock.","Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.","And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”","When Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching,","for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes."],["After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.","And look! a leper came up and did obeisance  to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”","So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to! Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.","Then Jesus said to him: “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for a witness to them.”","When he entered Ca·perʹna·um, an army officer came to him, pleading with him","and saying: “Sir, my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis, and he is suffering terribly.”","He said to him: “When I get there, I will cure him.”","The army officer replied: “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but just say the word and my servant will be healed.","For I too am a man under authority, having  soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”","When Jesus heard that, he was amazed and said to those following him: “I tell you the truth, with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.","But I tell you that many from east and west will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens;","whereas the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.”","Then Jesus said to the army officer: “Go. Just as you have shown faith, so let it come to pass for you.” And the servant was healed in that hour.","And Jesus, on coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever.","So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him.","But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed ones; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were suffering,","in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: “He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.”","When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to depart for the other side.","And a scribe came up and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”","But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”","Then another of the disciples said to him: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”","Jesus said to him: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.”","And when he went aboard a boat, his disciples followed him.","Now look! a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but he was sleeping.","And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are about to perish!”","But he said to them: “Why are you so afraid,  you with little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in.","So the men were amazed and said: “What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him.”","When he came to the other side into the region of the Gad·a·renesʹ, two demon-possessed men coming out from among the tombs  met him. They were unusually fierce, so nobody had the courage to pass by on that road.","And look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”","A long way off from them, a herd of many swine was feeding.","So the demons began to plead with him, saying: “If you expel us, send us into the herd of swine.”","And he said to them: “Go!” With that they came out and went off into the swine, and look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice  into the sea and died in the waters.","But the herders fled, and going into the city, they reported everything, including the account of the demon-possessed men.","And look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they urged him to depart from their region."],["So boarding the boat, he traveled across and went into his own city.","And look! they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. On seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic: “Take courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.”","Now certain scribes said to themselves: “This fellow is blaspheming.”","Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “Why are you thinking wicked things in your hearts?","For instance, which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?","However, in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” then he said to the paralytic: “Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”","And he got up and went to his home.","When the crowds saw this, they were struck with fear, and they glorified God, who gave such authority to men.","Next, while moving on from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” At that he rose up and followed him.","Later as he was dining  in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began dining  with Jesus and his disciples.","But on seeing this, the Pharisees said to his disciples: “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”","Hearing them, he said: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.","Go, then, and learn what this means: ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”","Then John’s disciples came to him and asked: “Why do we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast?”","At this Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, do they?

Your faith has made you well.” And from that hour the woman was made well.","When, now, he came into the ruler’s house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,","Jesus said: “Leave the place, for the little girl did not die but is sleeping.” At this they began to laugh at him scornfully.","As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, and the little girl got up.","Of course, the talk about this spread into all that region.","As Jesus moved on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting out: “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”","After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: “Do you have faith that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord.”","Then he touched their eyes, saying: “According to your faith let it happen to you.”","And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly warned them, saying: “See that nobody gets to know it.”","But after going outside, they made it public about him in all that region.","When they were leaving, look! people brought him a speechless man possessed of a demon;","and after the demon had been expelled, the speechless man spoke. Well, the crowds were amazed and said: “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.”","But the Pharisees were saying: “It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.”","And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.","On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.","Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.","Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”"],["So he summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.","The names of the 12 apostles are these: First, Simon, the one called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebʹe·dee and John his brother;","Philip and Bar·tholʹo·mew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Al·phaeʹus; and Thad·daeʹus;","Simon the Ca·na·naeʹan;  and Judas Is·carʹi·ot, who later betrayed him.","These 12 Jesus sent out, giving them these instructions: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter any Sa·marʹi·tan city;","but instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","As you go, preach, saying: ‘The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’","Cure the sick, raise up the dead, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free.","Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your money belts,","or a food pouch for the trip, or two garments,  or sandals, or a staff, for the worker deserves his food.","“Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving, and stay there until you leave.","When you enter the house, greet the household.","If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you.","Wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words, on going out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.","Truly I say to you, it will be more endurable for the land of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah on Judgment Day than for that city.","“Look! I am sending you out as sheep among wolves;  so prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.","Be on your guard against men, for they will hand you over to local courts and they will scourge you in their synagogues.","And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.","However, when they hand you over, do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak, for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour;","for the ones speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you.","Further, brother will hand brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death.","And you will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured  to the end will be saved.","When they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to you, you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.","“A student is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.","It is enough for the student to become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. If people have called the master of the house Be·elʹze·bub,  how much more those of his household?","So do not fear them, for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.","What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, preach from the housetops.","And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul;  rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Ge·henʹna.","Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value,  do they not? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge.","But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.","So have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.","“Everyone, then, who acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in the heavens.","But whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens.","Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth; I came to bring, not peace, but a sword.","For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.","Indeed, a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.","Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me.","And whoever does not accept his torture stake  and follow after me is not worthy of me.","Whoever finds his soul  will lose it, and whoever loses his soul  for my sake will find it.","“Whoever receives you receives me also, and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me.","Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a  righteous man will get a righteous man’s reward.","And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I tell you truly, he will by no means lose his reward.”"],["When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his 12 disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.","But John, having heard in jail about the works of the Christ, sent his disciples","to ask him: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?”","In reply Jesus said to them: “Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing:","The blind are now seeing and the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news.","Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me.”","While these were on their way, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being tossed by the wind?","What, then, did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments?  Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings.","Really, then, why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.","This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,  who will prepare your way ahead of you!’","Truly I say to you, among those born of women, there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist, but a lesser person in the Kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.","From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it.","For all, the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John;","and if you are willing to accept it, he is ‘E·liʹjah who is to come.’","Let the one who has ears listen.","“With whom will I compare this generation? It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates,","saying: ‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.’","Likewise, John came neither eating nor drinking, but people say, ‘He has a demon.’","The Son of man did come eating and drinking, but people say, ‘Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ All the same, wisdom is proved righteous  by its works.”","Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place, for they did not repent:","“Woe to you, Cho·raʹzin! Woe to you, Beth·saʹi·da! because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Siʹdon, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.","But I say to you, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Siʹdon on Judgment Day than for you.","And you, Ca·perʹna·um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave  you will come; because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sodʹom,  it would have remained until this very day.","But I say to you, it will be more endurable for the land of Sodʹom on Judgment Day than for you.”","At that time Jesus said in response: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children.","Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved.","All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.","Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.","Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.","For my yoke is kindly,  and my load is light.”"],["At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat.","At seeing this, the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”","He said to them: “Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry?","How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation,  something that it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, but for the priests only?","Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and continue guiltless?","But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.","However, if you had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless ones.","For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.”","After departing from that place, he went into their synagogue,","and look! there was a man with a withered  hand! So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?” so that they might accuse him.","He said to them: “If you have one sheep and that sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, is there a man among you who will not grab hold of it and lift it out?","How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the Sabbath.”","Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand.","But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him.","Having come to know this, Jesus departed from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all,","but he sternly ordered them not to make him known,","in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:","“Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom I have  approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations.","He will not quarrel nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the main streets.","No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering wick will he extinguish, until he brings justice with success.","Indeed, in his name nations will hope.”","Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and speechless, and he cured him, so that the speechless man could speak and see.","Well, all the crowds were astounded and began to say: “May this not perhaps be the Son of David?”","At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Be·elʹze·bub,  the ruler of the demons.”","Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.","In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand?","Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges.","But if it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you.","Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Only then can he plunder his house.","Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","“For this reason I say to you, every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.","For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things  nor in that to come.","“Either you make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for by its fruit the tree is known.","Offspring of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are wicked? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.","The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things.","I tell you that men will render an account on Judgment Day for every unprofitable saying that they speak;","for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.”","Then as an answer to him, some of the scribes and the Pharisees said: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”","In reply he said to them: “A wicked and adulterous  generation keeps on seeking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Joʹnah the prophet.","For just as Joʹnah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.","Men of Ninʹe·veh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Joʹnah preached. But look! something more than Joʹnah is here.","The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solʹo·mon. But look! something more than Solʹo·mon is here.","“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in  search of a resting-place and finds none.","Then it says, ‘I will go back to my house from which I moved,’ and on arriving, it finds the house unoccupied but swept clean and adorned.","Then it goes and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.”","While he was yet speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to him.","So someone said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.”","In reply he said to the one who spoke to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”","And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: “Look! My mother and my brothers!","For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother.”"],["On that day Jesus left the house and was sitting by the sea.","And such large crowds gathered to him that he went aboard a boat and sat down, and all the crowd was standing on the beach.","Then he told them many things by illustrations, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow.","As he was sowing, some seeds fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.","Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil, and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep.","But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.","Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.","Still others fell on the fine soil, and they began to yield fruit, this one 100 times more, that one 60, the other 30.","Let the one who has ears listen.”","So the disciples came and said to him: “Why do you speak to them by the use of illustrations?”","In reply he said: “To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not granted.","For whoever has, more will be given him, and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.","That is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations; for looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, nor do they get the sense of it.","And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in their case. It says: ‘You will indeed hear but by no means get the sense of it, and you will indeed look but by no means see.","For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes, so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back and I heal them.’","“However, happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.","For truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.","“Now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed.","Where anyone hears the word of the Kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches  away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road.","As for the one sown on rocky ground, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy.","Yet, he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word, he is at once stumbled.","As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things  and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.","As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one 100 times more, that one 60, the other 30.”","He presented another illustration to them, saying: “The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field.","While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left.","When the stalk sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.","So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it have weeds?’","He said to them, ‘An enemy, a man, did this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?’","He said, ‘No, for fear that while collecting the weeds, you uproot the wheat with them.","Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest season, I will tell the reapers: First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up; then gather the wheat into my storehouse.’”","He presented another illustration to them, saying: “The Kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his field.","It is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds, but when it has grown, it is the largest of the vegetable plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches.”","He told them another illustration: “The Kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented.”","All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them,","in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said: “I will open my mouth with illustrations; I will proclaim things hidden since the founding.”","Then after dismissing the crowds, he went into the house. His disciples came to him and said: “Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.”","In response he said: “The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man;","the field is the world. As for the fine seed, these are the sons of the Kingdom, but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one,","and the enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things,  and the reapers are angels.","Therefore, just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things.","The Son of man will send his angels,  and they will collect out from his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness,","and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.","At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Let the one who has ears listen.","“The Kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure, hidden in the field, that a man found and hid; and because of his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.","“Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls.","Upon finding one pearl of high value, he went away and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.","“Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering fish of every kind.","When it was full, they hauled it up onto the beach, and sitting down, they collected the fine ones into containers, but the unsuitable they threw away.","That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things.  The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous","and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.","“Did you get the sense of all these things?” They said to him: “Yes.”","Then he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor who is taught about the Kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who brings out of his treasure store things both new and old.”","When Jesus had finished these illustrations, he departed from there.","After coming into his home territory, he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: “Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works?","Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?","And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did he get all of this?”","So they began to stumble because of him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and in his own house.”","And he did not perform many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith."],["At that time Herod, the district ruler,  heard the report about Jesus","and said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why these powerful works are operating in him.”","Herod  had arrested John and had bound him and imprisoned him because of He·roʹdi·as, the wife of Philip his brother.","For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.”","However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet.","But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of He·roʹdi·as danced for the occasion and pleased Herod so much","that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.","Then she, at her mother’s prompting, said: “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”","Grieved though he was, the king, out of regard  for his oaths and for those dining  with him, commanded it to be given.","So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.","His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.","Later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him; then they came and reported to Jesus.","At hearing this, Jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone. But the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.","When he came ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones.","But when evening fell, his disciples came to him and said: “The place is isolated and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”","However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave; you give them something to eat.”","They said to him: “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”","He said: “Bring them here to me.”","And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said a blessing, and after breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.","So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, 12 baskets full.","Now those eating were about 5,000 men, as well as women and young children.","Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore, while he sent the crowds away.","After sending the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.","By now the boat was many hundreds of yards  away from land, struggling against the waves because the wind was against them.","But in the fourth watch of the night  he came to them, walking on the sea.","When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out in their fear.","But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying: “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.”","Peter answered him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.”","He said: “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward Jesus.","But looking at the windstorm, he became afraid. And when he started to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!”","Immediately stretching out his hand, Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?”","After they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated.","Then those in the boat did obeisance  to him, saying: “You really are God’s Son.”","And they crossed over and came to land in Gen·nesʹa·ret.","On recognizing him, the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill.","And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment, and all those who touched it were made completely well."],["Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying:","“Why do your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash  their hands when about to eat a meal.”","In reply he said to them: “Why do you overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition?","For example, God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Let the one who speaks abusively of  his father or mother be put to death.’","But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother: “Whatever I have that could benefit you is a gift dedicated to God,”","he need not honor his father at all.’ So you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.","You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said:","‘This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.","It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.’”","With that he called the crowd near and said to them: “Listen and get the sense of it:","It is not what enters into a man’s mouth that defiles him, but it is what comes out of his mouth that defiles him.”","Then the disciples came and said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees were stumbled at hearing what you said?”","In reply he said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.","Let them be. Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”","Peter responded: “Make the illustration plain to us.”","At this he said: “Are you also still without understanding?","Are you not aware that whatever enters into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer?","However, whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and those things defile a man.","For example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings: murders, adulteries, sexual immorality,  thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.","These are the things that defile a man; but to take a meal with unwashed  hands does not defile a man.”","Leaving there, Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Siʹdon.","And look! a Phoe·niʹcian woman from that region came and cried out: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is cruelly demon possessed.”","But he did not say a word in answer to her. So his disciples came and began to urge him: “Send her away, because she keeps crying out after us.”","He answered: “I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”","But the woman came and did obeisance  to him, saying: “Lord, help me!”","In answer he said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.”","She said: “Yes, Lord, but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”","Then Jesus replied to her: “O woman, great is your faith; let it happen to you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed from that hour on.","Departing from there, Jesus next came near the Sea of Galʹi·lee, and after going up on the mountain, he was sitting there.","Then large crowds approached him, bringing along people who were lame, maimed, blind, speechless, and many others, and they laid them at his feet, and he cured them.","So the crowd felt amazement as they saw the speechless speaking and the maimed being made sound and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.","But Jesus called his disciples to him and said: “I feel pity for the crowd, because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have had nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry,  for they may give out on the road.”","However, the disciples said to him: “Where in this isolated place are we going to get enough bread to satisfy a crowd of this size?”","At this Jesus said to them: “How many loaves do you have?” They said: “Seven, and a few small fish.”","So after instructing the crowd to recline on the ground,","he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after offering thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.","And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up seven large baskets  full of leftover fragments.","Now those eating were 4,000 men, as well as women and young children.","Finally, after sending the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the region of Magʹa·dan."],["Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him, and to test him, they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven.","In reply he said to them: “When evening falls, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red,’","and in the morning, ‘It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red but gloomy.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot interpret.","A wicked and adulterous  generation keeps seeking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Joʹnah.” With that he went away, leaving them behind.","Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take bread along.","Jesus said to them: “Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”","So they began to reason among themselves, saying: “We did not take any loaves along.”","Knowing this, Jesus said: “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no loaves, you with little faith?","Do you not yet see the point, or do you not remember the five loaves in the case of the 5,000 and how many baskets you took up?","Or the seven loaves in the case of the 4,000 and how many large baskets  you took up?","How is it you do not discern that I did not speak to you about bread? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”","Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of bread, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.","When he had come into the region of Caes·a·reʹa Phi·lipʹpi, Jesus asked his disciples: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?”","They said: “Some say John the Baptist, others E·liʹjah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”","He said to  them: “You, though, who do you say I am?”","Simon Peter answered: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”","In response Jesus said to him: “Happy you are, Simon son of Joʹnah, because flesh and blood  did not reveal it to you, but my Father in the heavens did.","Also, I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my congregation, and the gates of the Grave  will not overpower it.","I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will already be bound in the heavens, and whatever you may loosen on earth will already be loosened in the heavens.”","Then he sternly instructed the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ.","From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.","At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.”","But turning his back, he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”","Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake  and keep following me.","For whoever wants to save his life  will lose it, but whoever loses his life  for my sake will find it.","Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life?  Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?","For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will repay each one according to his behavior.","Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdom.”"],["Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves.","And he was transfigured before them; his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant  as the light.","And look! there appeared to them Moses and E·liʹjah conversing with him.","Then Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, it is fine for us to be here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.”","While he was still speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and look! a voice out of the cloud said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. Listen to him.”","At hearing this, the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid.","Then Jesus came near, and touching them, he said: “Get up. Have no fear.”","When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus himself.","As they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.”","However, the disciples put the question to him: “Why, then, do the scribes say that E·liʹjah must come first?”","In reply he said: “E·liʹjah is indeed coming and will restore all things.","However, I say to you that  E·liʹjah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did whatever they wanted with him. In this way also, the Son of man is going to suffer at their hands.”","Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.","When they came toward the crowd, a man approached him, knelt down to him, and said:","“Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill. He falls often into the fire and often into the water.","I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”","In reply Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.”","Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.","Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: “Why could we not expel it?”","He said to them: “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”","——","It was while they were gathered together in Galʹi·lee that Jesus said to them: “The Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands,","and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.” And they were very much grieved.","After they arrived in Ca·perʹna·um, the men collecting the two drachmas  tax approached Peter and said: “Does your teacher not pay the two drachmas tax?”","He said: “Yes.” However, when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first and said: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax? From their sons or from the strangers?”","When he said: “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him: “Really, then, the sons are tax-free.","But that we do not cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a fishhook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin.  Take that and give it to them for me and you.”"],["In that hour the disciples came near to Jesus and said: “Who really is greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens?”","So calling a young child to him, he stood him in their midst","and said: “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around  and become as young children, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.","Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens;","and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me also.","But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have hung around his neck a millstone that is turned by a donkey and to be sunk in the open sea.","“Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! Of course, it is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!","If, then, your hand or your foot makes you stumble, cut it off  and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire.","Also, if your eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter one-eyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Ge·henʹna.","See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven.","——","“What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays, will he not leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying?","And if he finds it, I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the 99 that have not strayed.","Likewise, it is not a desirable thing to my  Father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish.","“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go and reveal his fault  between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.","But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, so that on the testimony  of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.","If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.","“Truly I say to you, whatever things you may bind on earth will be things already bound in heaven, and whatever things you may loosen on earth will be things already loosened in heaven.","Again I tell you truly, if two of you on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request, it will take place for them on account of my Father in heaven.","For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”","Then Peter came and said to him: “Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?”","Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not up to seven times, but up to 77 times.","“That is why the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.","When he started to settle them, a man was brought in who owed him 10,000 talents.","But because he did not have the means to pay it back, his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he owned to be sold and payment to be made.","So the slave fell down and did obeisance  to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you.’","Moved with pity at this, the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt.","But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him 100 de·narʹi·i,  and grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back whatever you owe.’","So his fellow slave fell down and began to beg him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’","However, he was not willing, but he went and  had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.","When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they became greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all the things that had happened.","Then his master summoned him and said to him: ‘Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you when you pleaded with me.","Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you?’","With that his master, provoked to wrath, handed him over to the jailers until he repaid all that he owed.","My heavenly Father will also deal with you in the same way if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart.”"],["When Jesus had finished speaking these things, he departed from Galʹi·lee and came to the borders  of Ju·deʹa across the Jordan.","Also, large crowds followed him, and he cured them there.","And Pharisees came to him intent on testing him, and they asked: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of grounds?”","In reply he said: “Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female","and said: ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?","So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.”","They said to him: “Why, then, did Moses direct giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?”","He said to them: “Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, Moses made the concession to you of divorcing your wives, but that has not been the case from the beginning.","I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality,  and marries another commits adultery.”","The disciples said to him: “If that is the situation of a man with his wife, it is not advisable to marry.”","He said to them: “Not all men make room for the saying, but only those who have the gift.","For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs on account of the Kingdom of the heavens. Let the one who can make room for it make room for it.”","Then young children were brought to him for him to place his hands on them and offer prayer, but the disciples reprimanded them.","Jesus, however, said: “Let the young children alone, and do not try to stop them from coming to me, for the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones.”","And he placed his hands on them and departed from there.","Now look! someone came up to him and said: “Teacher, what good must I do to gain everlasting life?”","He said to him: “Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.”","He said to him: “Which ones?” Jesus said: “You must not murder, you must not commit adultery, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness,","honor your father and your mother, and you must love your neighbor as yourself.”","The young man said to him: “I have kept all of these; what  am I still lacking?”","Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect,  go sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.”","When the young man heard this, he went away grieved, for he had many possessions.","Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of the heavens.","Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”","When the disciples heard that, they were greatly astounded, saying: “Who really can be saved?”","Looking at them intently, Jesus said to them: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”","Then Peter said in reply: “Look! We have left all things and followed you; what, then, will there be for us?”","Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you, in the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.","And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.","“But many who are first will be last, and the last first."],["“For the Kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","After he had agreed with the workers for a de·narʹi·us  a day, he sent them into his vineyard.","Going out also about the third hour,  he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;","and to those he said, ‘You too go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is fair.’","So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth hour  and the ninth hour  and did likewise.","Finally, about the 11th hour,  he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day unemployed?’","They replied, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You too go into the vineyard.’","“When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last and ending with the first.’","When the 11th-hour men came, they each received a de·narʹi·us.","So when the first came, they assumed that they would receive more, but they too were paid at the rate of a de·narʹi·us.","On receiving it, they began to complain against the master of the house","and said, ‘These last men put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’","But he said in reply to one of them, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a de·narʹi·us,  did you not?","Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you.","Do I not have the right to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye envious  because I am good?’","In this way, the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.”","While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road:","“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death","and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake; and on the third day he will be raised up.”","Then the mother of the sons of Zebʹe·dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance  and asking for something from him.","He said to her: “What do you want?” She replied to him: “Give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your Kingdom.”","Jesus answered: “You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.”","He said to them: “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”","When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at the two brothers.","But Jesus called them to him and said: “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.","This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,","and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.","Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life  as a ransom in exchange for many.”","As they were going out of Jerʹi·cho, a large crowd followed him.","And look! two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”","But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”","So Jesus stopped, called them, and said: “What do you want me to do for you?”","They said to him: “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”","Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and they followed him."],["When they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethʹpha·ge on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,","saying to them: “Go into the village that is within sight, and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.","If someone says anything to you, you must say, ‘The Lord needs them.’ At that he will immediately send them.”","This actually took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, who said:","“Tell the daughter of Zion: ‘Look! Your king is coming to you, mild-tempered and mounted on a donkey, yes, on a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.’”","So the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them.","They brought the donkey and its colt, and they put their outer garments on them, and he sat on them.","Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.","Moreover, the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept  shouting: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s  name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”","And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, saying: “Who is this?”","The crowds kept saying: “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazʹa·reth of Galʹi·lee!”","Jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.","And he said to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it a cave of robbers.”","Also, blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he cured them.","When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple, “Save, we pray, the Son of David!” they became indignant","and said to him: “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes. Did you never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of children and infants, you have brought forth praise’?”","And leaving them behind, he went out of the city to Bethʹa·ny and spent the night there.","While returning to the city early in the morning, he felt hungry.","He caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you ever again.” And the fig tree withered instantly.","When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said: “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”","In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.","And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.”","After he went into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: “By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”","In reply Jesus said to them: “I will also ask you one thing. If you tell me, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things:","The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?”  But they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why, then, did you not believe him?’","But if we say, ‘From men,’ we have the crowd to fear, for they all regard John as a prophet.”","So they answered Jesus: “We do not know.” He, in turn, said to them: “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.","“What do you think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, ‘Child, go work today in the vineyard.’","In answer this one said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward, he felt regret and went out.","Approaching the second, he said the same. This one replied, ‘I will, Sir,’ but did not go out.","Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said: “The first.” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God.","For John came  to you in a way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw this, you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him.","“Hear another illustration: There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad.","When the fruit season came around, he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit.","However, the cultivators took his slaves, and they beat one up, another they killed, another they stoned.","Again he sent other slaves, more than the first group, but they did the same to these.","Lastly he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’","On seeing the son, the cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!’","So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.","Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?”","They said to him: “Because they are evil, he will bring a terrible  destruction on them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators, who will give him the fruits when they become due.”","Jesus said to them: “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone.  This has come from Jehovah,  and it is marvelous in our eyes’?","This is why I say to you, the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.","Also, the person falling on this stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.”","When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they knew that he was speaking about them.","Although they wanted to seize  him, they feared the crowds, because these regarded him as a prophet."],["Once more Jesus spoke to them with illustrations, saying:","“The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son.","And he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come.","Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’","But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his business;","but the rest, seizing his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.","“The king grew wrathful and sent his armies and killed those murderers and burned their city.","Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.","Therefore, go to the roads leading out of the city, and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast.’","Accordingly, those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those dining.","“When the king came in to inspect the guests, he caught sight of a man not wearing  a marriage garment.","So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here without a marriage garment?’ He was speechless.","Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’","“For there are many invited, but few chosen.”","Then the Pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in his speech.","So they sent their disciples to him, together with party followers of Herod, saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not seek anyone’s favor, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people.","Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful  to pay head tax to Caesar or not?”","But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do you put me to the test, hypocrites?","Show me the tax coin.” They brought him a de·narʹi·us.","He said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?”","They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”","When they heard that, they were amazed, and they left him and went away.","On that day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him:","“Teacher, Moses said: ‘If any man dies without having children, his brother must marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’","Now there were seven brothers with us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife for his brother.","The same thing happened with the second and the third, through all seven.","Last of all, the woman died.","So in the resurrection, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her as a wife.”","In reply Jesus said to them: “You are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God;","for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven.","Regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said:","‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.”","On hearing that, the crowds were astounded at his teaching.","After the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together in one group.","And one of them, versed in the Law, tested him by asking:","“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”","He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah  your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul  and with your whole mind.’","This is the greatest and first commandment.","The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’","On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”","Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:","“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David’s.”","He asked them: “How is it, then, that David under inspiration calls him Lord,  saying,","‘Jehovah  said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’?","If, then, David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”","And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, and from that day on, no one dared to question him any further."],["Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying:","“The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses.","Therefore, all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but they do not practice what they say.","They bind up heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger.","All the works they do, they do to be seen by men, for they broaden the scripture-containing cases that they wear as safeguards  and lengthen the fringes of their garments.","They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front  seats in the synagogues","and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi  by men.","But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your Teacher, and all of you are brothers.","Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One.","Neither be called leaders, for your Leader is one, the Christ.","But the greatest one among you must be your minister.","Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the Kingdom of the heavens before men; for you yourselves do not go in, neither do you permit those on their way in to go in.","——","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you travel over sea and dry land to make one proselyte,  and when he becomes one, you make him a subject for Ge·henʹna  twice as much so as yourselves.","“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is under obligation.’","Fools and blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold?","Moreover, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is under obligation.’","Blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?","Therefore, whoever swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it;","and whoever swears by the temple is swearing by it and by the One inhabiting it;","and whoever swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by the One sitting on it.","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was necessary to do, yet not to disregard the other things.","Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside  they are full of greediness  and self-indulgence.","Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may also become clean.","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every sort of uncleanness.","In the same way, on the outside you appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.","“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the graves of the prophets and decorate the tombs  of the righteous ones,","and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have shared with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’","Therefore, you are testifying against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.","Well, then, fill up the measure of your forefathers.","“Serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of Ge·henʹna?","For this reason, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and public instructors.

But you did not want it.","Look! Your house is abandoned to you.","For I say to you, you will by no means see me from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s  name!’”"],["Now as Jesus was departing from the temple, his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple.","In response he said to them: “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”","While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence  and of the conclusion of the system of things?”","In answer Jesus said to them: “Look out that nobody misleads you,","for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will mislead many.","You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for these things must take place, but the end is not yet.","“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.","All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.","“Then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill  you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.","Then, too, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another.","Many false prophets will arise and mislead many;","and because of the increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number will grow cold.","But the one who has endured  to the end will be saved.","And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.","“Therefore, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken about by Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place (let the reader use discernment),","then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing to the mountains.","Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house,","and let the man in the field not return to pick up his outer garment.","Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days!","Keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the Sabbath day;","for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.","In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.","“Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There!’ do not believe it.","For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.","Look! I have forewarned you.","Therefore, if people say to you, ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look! He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.","For just as the lightning comes out of the east and shines over to the west, so the presence  of the Son of man will be.","Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.","“Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","Then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.","And he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.","“Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.","Likewise also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.","Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.","“Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.","For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence  of the Son of man will be.","For as  they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,","and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.","Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken along and the other abandoned.","Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken along and the other abandoned.","Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.","“But know one thing: If the householder had known in what watch  the thief was coming, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.","On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.","“Who really is the faithful and discreet  slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?","Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so!","Truly I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.","“But if ever that evil slave says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying,’","and he starts to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards,","the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know,","and he will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his place with the hypocrites. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be."],["“Then the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.","Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet.","For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them,","whereas the discreet took oil in their flasks along with their lamps.","While the bridegroom was delaying, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.","Right in the middle of the night there was a shout: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Go out to meet him.’","Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order.","The foolish said to the discreet, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.’","The discreet answered, saying: ‘Perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy some for yourselves.’","While they were going off to buy it, the bridegroom came. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.","Afterward, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, ‘Sir, Sir, open to us!’","In answer he said, ‘I tell you the truth, I do not know you.’","“Keep on the watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.","“For it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them.","He gave five talents  to one, two to another, and one to still another, to each according to his own ability, and he went abroad.","Immediately the one who received  the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more.","Likewise, the one who received the two gained two more.","But the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.","“After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.","So the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’","His master said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’","Next the one who had received the two talents came forward and said, ‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me; see, I gained two talents more.’","His master said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’","“Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said: ‘Master, I knew you to be a demanding man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.","So I grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.’","In reply his master said to him: ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow?","Well, then, you should have deposited my money  with the bankers, and on my coming I would have received it back with interest.","“‘Therefore, take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.","For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.","And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’","“When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.","All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.","And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.","“Then the King will say to those on his right: ‘Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world.","For I became hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you received me hospitably;","naked  and you clothed me. I fell sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you visited me.’","Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?","When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked and clothe you?","When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’","In reply the King will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of  the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’","“Then he will say to those on his left: ‘Go away from me, you who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.","For I became hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat; and I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.","I was a stranger, but you did not receive me hospitably; naked, but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not look after me.’","Then they too will answer with the words: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?’","Then he will answer them, saying: ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones, you did not do it to me.’","These will depart into everlasting cutting-off,  but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”"],["Now when Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples:","“You know that two days from now the Passover takes place, and the Son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake.”","Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caʹia·phas,","and they conspired together to seize  Jesus by cunning  and to kill him.","However, they were saying: “Not at the festival, so that there may not be an uproar among the people.”","While Jesus was in Bethʹa·ny in the house of Simon the leper,","a woman with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it on his head as he was dining.","On seeing this, the disciples became indignant and said: “Why this waste?","For this could have been sold for a great deal of money and given to the poor.”","Aware of this, Jesus said to them: “Why do you try to make trouble for the woman? She did a fine deed toward me.","For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.","When she put this perfumed oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.","Truly I say to you, wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.”","Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Is·carʹi·ot, went to the chief priests","and said: “What will you give me to betray him to you?” They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces.","So from then on, he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him.","On the first day of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”","He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, ‘The Teacher says: “My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.”’”","So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.","When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples.","While they were eating, he said: “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.”","Being very much grieved at this, each and every one began to say to him: “Lord, it is not I,  is it?”","In reply he said: “The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will betray me.","True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”","Judas, who was about to betray him, replied: “It is not I, is it, Rabbi?” Jesus said to him: “You yourself said it.”","As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf, and after saying a blessing, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said: “Take, eat. This means my body.”","And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, saying: “Drink out of it, all of you,","for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.","But I say to you: I will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.”","Finally, after singing praises,  they went out to the Mount of Olives.","Then Jesus said to them: “All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.’","But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galʹi·lee.”","But Peter, in response, said to him: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled!”","Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you, on this night, before a rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”","Peter said to him: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” All the other disciples also said the same thing.","Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Geth·semʹa·ne, and he said to the disciples: “Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”","And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebʹe·dee, he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.","Then he said to them: “I am  deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.”","And going a little way forward, he fell facedown, praying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”","He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: “Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me?","Keep on the watch and pray continually, so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager,  but the flesh is weak.”","Again, a second time, he went off and prayed: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away unless I drink it, let your will take place.”","And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.","So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for a third time, saying once more the same thing.","Then he returned to the disciples and said to them: “At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting! Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.”","While he was still speaking, look! Judas, one of the Twelve, came and with him a large crowd  with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.","Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying: “Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one; take him into custody.”","And going straight up to Jesus, he said: “Greetings, Rabbi!” and gave him a tender kiss.","But Jesus said to him: “Fellow, for what purpose are you present?” Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody.","But look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.","Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.","Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels?","In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way?”","In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: “Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into custody.","But all of this has taken place for the writings  of the prophets to be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.","Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Caʹia·phas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.","But Peter kept following him from a good distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and after going inside, he sat with the house attendants to see the outcome.","Now the chief priests and the entire Sanʹhe·drin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death.","But they found none, although many false witnesses came forward. Later two came forward","and said: “This man said, ‘I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.’”","With that the high priest stood up and said to him: “Do you say nothing in reply? What is it these men are testifying against you?”","But Jesus kept silent. So the high priest said to him: “I put you under oath by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God!”","Jesus said to him: “You yourself said it. But I say to you: From now on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”","Then the high priest ripped his outer garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now you have heard the blasphemy.","What is your opinion?” They answered: “He deserves to die.”","Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him on the face,","saying: “Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who struck you?”","Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him and said: “You too were with Jesus the Gal·i·leʹan!”","But he denied it before them all, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”","When he went out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him and said to those there: “This man was with Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ.”","Again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man!”","After a little while, those  standing around came up and said to Peter: “Certainly you are also one of them, for in fact, your dialect  gives you away.”","Then he started to curse and swear: “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.","And Peter called to mind what Jesus had said, namely: “Before a rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly."],["When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death.","After binding him, they led him off and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.","Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, felt remorse and brought the 30 pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders,","saying: “I sinned when I betrayed innocent blood.” They said: “What is that to us? You must see to it!”","So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed. Then he went off and hanged himself.","But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: “It is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.”","After consulting together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.","Therefore, that field has been called Field of Blood to this very day.","Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “And they took the 30 silver pieces, the price that was set on the man, the one on whom a price was set by some of the sons of Israel,","and they gave them for the potter’s field, according to what Jehovah  had commanded me.”","Jesus now stood before the governor, and the governor put the question to him: “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus replied: “You yourself say it.”","But while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.","Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”","But he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor was very surprised.","Now from festival to festival, it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.","Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Bar·abʹbas.","So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them: “Which one do you want me to release to you, Bar·abʹbas or Jesus the so-called Christ?”","For Pilate was aware that out of envy they had handed him over.","Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him.”","But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar·abʹbas, but to have Jesus put to death.","In response the governor said to them: “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” They said: “Bar·abʹbas.”","Pilate said to them: “What, then, should I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?” They all said: “To the stake with him!”","He said: “Why? What bad thing did he do?” Still they kept shouting out all the more: “To the stake with him!”","Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You yourselves must see to it.”","At that all the people said in answer: “Let his blood come upon us and upon our children.”","Then he released Bar·abʹbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be executed on the stake.","Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole body of troops together around him.","And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak,","and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying: “Greetings,  you King of the Jews!”","And they spat on him and took the reed and began hitting him on his head.","Finally, after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak and put his outer garments on him and led him off to be nailed to the stake.","As they were going out, they found a man of Cy·reʹne named Simon. This man they compelled into service to carry his torture stake.","And when they came to a place called  Golʹgo·tha,  that is, Skull Place,","they gave him wine mixed with gall  to drink; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.","When they had nailed him to the stake, they distributed his outer garments by casting lots,","and they sat there keeping watch over him.","They also posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”","Then two robbers were put on stakes alongside him, one on his right and one on his left.","And those passing by spoke abusively of him, shaking their heads","and saying: “You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!”","In the same way also, the chief priests with the scribes and the elders began mocking him, saying:","“Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake,  and we will believe in him.","He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”","In the same way, even the robbers who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him.","From the sixth hour  on, a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.","About the ninth hour, Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying:  “Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?”  that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”","At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling E·liʹjah.”","And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it in sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.","But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether E·liʹjah comes to save him.”","Again Jesus called out with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.","And look! the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks  were split.","And the tombs  were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised up","(and people coming out from among the tombs after his being raised up entered into the holy city), and they became visible to many people.","But when the army officer and those with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and the things happening, they grew very much afraid and said: “Certainly this was God’s Son.”","And many women were there watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galʹi·lee to minister to him;","among them were Mary Magʹda·lene and Mary the mother of James and Joʹses and the mother of the sons of Zebʹe·dee.","Now as it was late in the afternoon, a rich man of Ar·i·ma·theʹa came, named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of Jesus.","This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.","Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean, fine linen,","and laid it in his new tomb,  which he had quarried in the rock. And after rolling a big stone to the entrance of the tomb,  he left.","But Mary Magʹda·lene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave.","The next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate,","saying: “Sir, we recall what that impostor said while he was still alive, ‘After three days I am to be raised up.’","Therefore, command that the grave be made secure until the third day, so that his disciples may not come and steal him and say to the people, ‘He was raised up from the dead!’ Then this last deception will be worse than the first.”","Pilate said to them: “You may have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how.”","So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and posting a guard."],["After the Sabbath, when it was growing light on the first day of the week, Mary Magʹda·lene and the other Mary came to view the grave.","And look! a great earthquake had taken place, for Jehovah’s  angel had descended from heaven and had come and rolled away the stone, and he was sitting on it.","His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.","Yes, out of their fear of him, the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.","But the angel said to the women: “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was executed on the stake.","He is not here, for he was raised up, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.","Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, for look! he is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee. You will see him there. Look! I have told you.”","So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.","And look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and took hold of his feet and did obeisance  to him.","Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers so that they may go to Galʹi·lee, and there they will see me.”","While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.","And after these had gathered with the elders and had consulted together, they gave a considerable number of silver pieces to the soldiers","and said: “Say, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’","And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will explain the matter to  him and you will not need to worry.”","So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed, and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.","However, the 11 disciples went to Galʹi·lee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them to meet.","When they saw him, they did obeisance,  but some doubted.","Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.","Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,","teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”"]],"Mark":[["The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God:","Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “(Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,  who will prepare your way.)","A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah!  Make his roads straight.’”","John the Baptizer was in the wilderness, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.","And all the territory of Ju·deʹa and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were baptized  by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.","Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair and a  leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.","And he was preaching: “Someone stronger than I am is coming after me, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.","I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with holy spirit.”","In the course of those days, Jesus came from Nazʹa·reth of Galʹi·lee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.","And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being parted and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him.","And a voice came out of the heavens: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.”","And immediately the spirit impelled him to go into the wilderness.","So he continued in the wilderness for 40 days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild beasts, but the angels were ministering to him.","Now after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galʹi·lee, preaching the good news of God","and saying: “The appointed time has been fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent, and have faith in the good news.”","While walking alongside the Sea of Galʹi·lee, he saw Simon and Simon’s brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen.","So Jesus said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”","And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him.","After going a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebʹe·dee and his brother John, while they were in their boat mending their nets,","and without delay he called them. So they left their father Zebʹe·dee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him.","And they went into Ca·perʹna·um.","And they were astounded at his way of teaching, for he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.","Just then there was a man in their synagogue who was under the power of an unclean spirit, and he shouted:","“What have we to do with you, Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ? Did you come to destroy us? I know exactly who you are, the Holy One of God!”","But Jesus rebuked it, saying: “Be silent, and come out of him!”","And the unclean spirit, after throwing the man into a convulsion and yelling at the top of its voice, came out of him.","Well, the people were all so astonished that they began to discuss it among themselves, saying: “What is this? A new teaching! He authoritatively orders even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”","So the report about him spread quickly in all directions throughout the entire region of Galʹi·lee.","At that they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew with James and John.","Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down sick with a fever, and they at once told him about her.","Going to her, he took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began ministering to them.","After evening had fallen, when the sun had set, the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed;","and the whole city was gathered right at the door.","So he cured many who were ill  with various sicknesses, and he expelled many demons, but he would not let the demons speak, for they knew him to be Christ.","Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up and went outside and left for an isolated place, and there he began praying.","However, Simon and those with him hunted him down","and found him, and they said to him: “Everyone is looking for you.”","But he said to them: “Let us go somewhere else, into the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also, for this is why I have come.”","And he went, preaching in their synagogues throughout the whole of Galʹi·lee and expelling the demons.","There also came to him a leper, pleading with him even on bended knee, saying to him: “If you just want to, you can make me clean.”","At that he was moved with pity, and he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: “I want to! Be made clean.”","Immediately the leprosy vanished from him, and he became clean.","Then he gave him strict orders and at once sent him away,","saying to him: “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things Moses directed, for a witness to them.”","But after going away, the man started to proclaim it a great deal and to spread the account widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into a city, but he stayed outside in isolated places. Yet they kept coming to him from all sides."],["However, after some days he again entered into Ca·perʹna·um, and the word spread that he was at home.","And so many gathered that there was no more room, not even around the door, and he began to speak the word to them.","And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men.","But they could not bring him right to Jesus because of the crowd, so they removed the roof above Jesus, and after digging an opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.","When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: “Child, your sins are forgiven.”","Now some of the scribes were there, sitting and reasoning in their hearts:","“Why is this man talking this way? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?”","But immediately Jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves, so he said to them: “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?","Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?","But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth—” he said to the paralytic:","“I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”","At that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all. So they were all astonished, and they glorified God, saying: “We have never seen anything like this.”","Again he went out alongside the sea, and all the crowd kept coming to him, and he began to teach them.","And as he was passing by, he caught sight of Leʹvi the son of Al·phaeʹus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” At that he rose up and followed him.","Later he was dining   in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining  with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many of them who were following him.","But when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they began saying to his disciples: “Does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”","On hearing this, Jesus said to them: “Those who are strong do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”","Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees practiced fasting. So they came and said to him: “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees practice fasting, but your disciples do not practice fasting?”","So Jesus said to them: “While the bridegroom is with them, the friends of the bridegroom have no reason to fast, do they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.","But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.","Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment. If he does, the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse.","Also, no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. But new wine is put into new wineskins.”","Now as he was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, his disciples started to pluck the heads of grain as they went.","So the Pharisees said to him: “Look here! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”","But he said to them: “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and the men with him were hungry?","How, in the account about A·biʹa·thar the chief priest, he entered into the house of God and ate the loaves of presentation,  which it is not lawful for anybody to eat except the priests, and he also gave some to the men who were with him?”","Then he said to them: “The Sabbath came into existence for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.","So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”"],["Once again he entered into a synagogue, and a man with a withered  hand was there.","So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.","He said to the man with the withered  hand: “Get up and come to the center.”","Next he said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life  or to kill?” But they kept silent.","After looking around at them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.","At that the Pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of Herod against him, in order to kill him.","But Jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples, and a great multitude from Galʹi·lee and from Ju·deʹa followed him.","Even from Jerusalem and from Id·u·meʹa and from across the Jordan and from around Tyre and Siʹdon, a great multitude  came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing.","And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him.","Because he cured many, all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him.","Even the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and cry out and say: “You are the Son of God.”","But many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known.","He ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him.","And he formed  a group of 12, whom he also named apostles, those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach","and to have authority to expel demons.","And the group of 12 that he formed  were Simon, to whom he also gave the name Peter,","James the son of Zebʹe·dee and John the brother of James (he also gave these the name Bo·a·nerʹges, which means “Sons of Thunder”),","Andrew, Philip, Bar·tholʹo·mew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, Thad·daeʹus, Simon the Ca·na·naeʹan,","and Judas Is·carʹi·ot, who later betrayed him.","and again the crowd gathered, so that they were not able even to eat a meal.","But when his relatives heard about it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying: “He has gone out of his mind.”","Also, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying: “He has Be·elʹze·bub,  and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons.”","So after calling them to him, he spoke to them with illustrations: “How can Satan expel Satan?","If a kingdom becomes divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;","and if a house becomes divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.","Also, if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end.","In fact, no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house.","Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men, no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak.","But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin.”","He said this because they were saying: “He has an unclean spirit.”","Now his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.","As there was a crowd sitting around him, they said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”","But he replied to them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?”","Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said: “See, my mother and my brothers!","Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.”"],["Again he began teaching beside the sea, and a very large crowd gathered near him. So he went aboard a boat and sat in it away from the shore, but the whole crowd was next to the sea, along the shore.","And he began to teach them many things  with illustrations, and while he was teaching, he said to them:","“Listen. Look! The sower went out to sow.","As he was sowing, some seeds fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.","Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil, and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep.","But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.","Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them, and they yielded no fruit.","But others fell on the fine soil, and growing up and increasing, they began to yield fruit, and they were bearing 30, 60, and 100 times more.”","Then he added: “Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”","Now when he was alone, those around him with the Twelve began questioning him about the illustrations.","He said to them: “To you the sacred secret of the Kingdom of God has been given, but to those outside all things are in illustrations,","so that, though looking, they may look and still not see, and though hearing, they may hear and still not get the sense of it; nor will they ever turn back and receive forgiveness.”","Further, he said to them: “You do not know this illustration, so how will you understand all the other illustrations?","“The sower sows the word.","These, then, are the ones alongside the road where the word is sown; but as soon as they have heard it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.","Likewise, these are the ones sown on rocky ground; as soon as they have heard the word, they accept it with joy.","Yet they have no root in themselves, but they continue for a time; then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, they are stumbled.","There are still others that are sown among the thorns. These are the ones who have heard the word,","but the anxieties of this system of things  and the deceptive power of riches and the desires for everything else make inroads and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.","Finally, the ones that were sown on the fine soil are those who listen to the word and favorably receive it and bear fruit—30, 60, and 100 times more.”","He also said to them: “A lamp is not brought out to be put under a basket  or under a bed, is it? Is it not brought out to be put on a lampstand?","For there is nothing hidden that will not be exposed; nothing is carefully concealed that will not come out in the open.","Whoever has ears to listen, let him listen.”","He further said to them: “Pay attention to what you are hearing. With the measure that you are measuring out, you will have it measured out to you, yes, you will have more added to you.","For whoever has will have more given to him, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”","So he went on to say: “In this way the Kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground.","He sleeps at night and rises up by day, and the seeds sprout and grow tall—just how, he does not know.","On its own the ground bears fruit gradually, first the stalk,  then the head, finally the full grain in the head.","But as soon as the crop permits it, he thrusts in the sickle, because the harvesttime has come.”","And he went on to say: “With what can we compare the Kingdom of God, or with what illustration can we explain it?","It is like a mustard grain, which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds on the earth.","But when it has been sown, it grows and becomes greater than all other vegetable plants and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow.”","With many illustrations of that sort he spoke the word to them, to the extent that they were able to listen.","Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, but he would explain all things privately to his disciples.","And on that day, when evening had fallen, he said to them: “Let us cross to the other shore.”","So after they had dismissed the crowd, they took him in the boat, just as he was, and there were other boats with him.","Now a great violent windstorm broke out, and the waves kept crashing into the boat, so that the boat was close to being swamped.","But he was in the stern, sleeping on the pillow.  So they woke him up and said to him: “Teacher, do you not care that we are about to perish?”","With that he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea: “Hush! Be quiet!” And the wind abated, and a great calm set in.","So he said to them: “Why are you so afraid?  Do you not yet have any faith?”","But they felt an unusual fear, and they said to one another: “Who really is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him.”"],["Then they came to the other side of the sea into the region of the Gerʹa·senes.","And immediately after Jesus got out of the boat, a man under the power of an unclean spirit met him from among the tombs.","His haunt was among the tombs, and up to that time, absolutely no one was able to bind him securely, even with a chain.","He had often been bound with fetters and chains, but he snapped the chains apart and smashed the fetters; and nobody had the strength to subdue him.","And continually, night and day, he was crying out in the tombs and in the mountains and slashing himself with stones.","But on catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down to him.","Then he cried out with a loud voice: “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I put you under oath by God not to torment me.”","For Jesus had been saying to it: “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.”","But Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” And he replied: “My name is Legion, because there are many of us.”","And he kept pleading with Jesus not to send the spirits out of the country.","Now a great herd of swine was feeding there at the mountain.","So the spirits pleaded with him: “Send us into the swine, so that we may enter into them.”","And he gave them permission. With that the unclean spirits came out and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice  into the sea, about 2,000 of them,  and were drowned in the sea.","But their herders fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside, and people came to see what had happened.","So they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who previously had the legion, sitting clothed and in his right mind, and they grew fearful.","Also, those who had seen it related to them how this had happened to the demon-possessed man and the swine.","So they began to plead with Jesus to go away from their region.","Now as he was boarding the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed pleaded to go with him.","However, he did not let him but said to him: “Go home to your relatives, and report to them all the things Jehovah  has done for you and the mercy he has shown you.”","This man went away and started to proclaim in the De·capʹo·lis  all the things Jesus had done for him, and all the people were amazed.","After Jesus had crossed again by boat to the opposite shore, a large crowd gathered together to him, and he was by the sea.","One of the presiding officers of the synagogue, named Jaʹi·rus, now came, and on catching sight of him, he fell at his feet.","He pleaded with him many times, saying: “My little daughter is extremely ill.  Please come and put your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”","At that Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing against him.","Now there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years.","She had suffered much  at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources, and she was no better but, rather, had become worse.","When she heard the reports about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment,","for she kept saying: “If I touch just his outer garments, I will get well.”","And immediately her flow of blood dried up, and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness.","Immediately Jesus realized in himself that power had gone out of him, and he turned around in the crowd and asked: “Who touched my outer garments?”","But his disciples said to him: “You see the crowd pressing in on you, and you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”","However, he was looking around to see who had done this.","The woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.","He said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed from your grievous sickness.”","While he was yet speaking, some men from the home of the presiding officer of the synagogue came and said: “Your daughter died! Why bother the Teacher any longer?”","But Jesus overheard their words and said to the presiding officer of the synagogue: “Have no fear,  only exercise faith.”","Now he did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.","So they came to the house of the presiding officer of the  synagogue, and he saw the commotion and those weeping and wailing loudly.","After stepping in, he said to them: “Why are you weeping and causing this commotion? The child has not died but is sleeping.”","At this they began to laugh at him scornfully. But after sending them all outside, he took the child’s father and mother and those with him, and he went in where the child was.","Then, taking the hand of the child, he said to her:  “Talʹi·tha cuʹmi,”  which, when translated, means: “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”","And immediately the girl rose and began walking. (She was 12 years old.) And at once they were beside themselves with great ecstasy.","But he ordered them again and again  to let no one learn of this, and he said that something should be given her to eat."],["He departed from there and came into his home territory, and his disciples followed him.","When it was the Sabbath, he started teaching in the synagogue, and most who heard him were astounded and said: “Where did this man get these things? And why should this wisdom have been given to him, and such powerful works be performed through his hands?","This is the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, is it not? And his sisters are here with us, are they not?” So they began to stumble because of him.","But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and among his relatives and in his own house.”","So he was not able to do any powerful work there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them.","Indeed, he was amazed at their lack of faith. And he went around in a circuit to the villages, teaching.","He now summoned the Twelve and started sending them out two by two, and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.","Also, he gave them orders to carry nothing for the trip except a staff—no bread, no food pouch, no money  in their belts—","but to put on sandals and not to wear two garments.","Further, he said to them: “Wherever you enter into a home, stay there until you leave that place.","And wherever a place will not receive you or listen to you, on going out from there, shake off the dirt that is on your feet for a witness to them.”","Then they set out and preached that people should repent,","and they expelled many demons and greased many sick people with oil and cured them.","Now King Herod heard of this, for the name of Jesus became well-known, and people were saying: “John the Baptizer has been raised up from the dead, and that is why the powerful works are operating in him.”","But others were saying: “It is E·liʹjah.” Still others were saying: “It is a prophet like one of the prophets of old.”","But when Herod heard it, he said: “The John whom I beheaded, this one has been raised up.”","For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and had bound him in prison on account of He·roʹdi·as, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.","For John had been saying to Herod: “It is not lawful for you to have your  brother’s wife.”","So He·roʹdi·as was nursing a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not.","For Herod was in fear of John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and he was keeping him safe. After hearing him, he was at a great loss as to what to do, yet he continued to hear him gladly.","But a convenient day arrived when Herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of Galʹi·lee.","And the daughter of He·roʹdi·as came in and danced and pleased Herod and those dining  with him. The king said to the girl: “Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”","Yes, he swore to her: “Whatever you ask me for, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.”","So she went out and said to her mother: “What should I ask for?” She said: “The head of John the Baptizer.”","She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request, saying: “I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”","Although this deeply grieved him, the king did not want to disregard her request, because of his oaths and his guests.","So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison","and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.","When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.","The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught.","And he said to them: “Come, you yourselves, privately into an isolated place and rest up a little.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure time even to eat a meal.","So they set off in the boat for an isolated place to be by themselves.","But people saw them going and many got to know it, and from all the cities they ran together on foot and got there ahead of them.","Well, on getting out, he saw a large crowd, and he was moved with pity for them, because they were as sheep without a shepherd. And he started to teach them many things.","By now the hour had grown late, and his disciples came up to him and said: “This place is isolated, and the hour is already late.","Send them away, so that they may go off into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”","He replied to them: “You give them something to eat.” At this they said to him: “Should we go off and buy 200 de·narʹi·i  worth of bread and give it to the people to eat?”","He said to them: “How many loaves do you have? Go see!” After finding out, they said: “Five, besides two fish.”","And he instructed all the people to recline in groups on the green grass.","So they reclined in groups of 100 and of 50.","Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves up and began giving them to the disciples to place them before the people, and he divided up the two fish for all.","So they all ate and were satisfied,","and they took up 12 baskets full of fragments, aside from the fish.","Those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men.","Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go on ahead to the opposite shore toward Beth·saʹi·da, while he himself sent the crowd away.","But after saying good-bye to them, he went to a mountain to pray.","When evening had fallen, the boat was in the middle of the sea, but he was alone on the land.","So when he saw them struggling to row, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night  he came toward them, walking on the sea; but he was inclined to  pass them by.","On catching sight of him walking on the sea, they thought: “It is an apparition!” And they cried out.","For they all saw him and were troubled. But immediately he spoke to them and said: “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.”","Then he got up into the boat with them, and the wind abated. At this they were utterly amazed,","for they had not grasped the meaning of the loaves, but their hearts continued dull in understanding.","When they got across to land, they came to Gen·nesʹa·ret and anchored the boat nearby.","But as soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized him.","They ran around all that region and started to bring on stretchers those who were ailing to where they heard he was.","And wherever he would enter into villages or cities or the countryside, they would place the sick ones in the marketplaces, and they would plead with him that they might touch just the fringe of his outer garment. And all those who touched it were made well."],["Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.","And they saw some of his disciples eat their meal with defiled hands, that is, unwashed ones.","(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow, clinging to the tradition of the men of former times,","and when they come from the market, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. There are many other traditions that they have received and cling to, such as baptisms of cups, pitchers, and copper vessels.)","So these Pharisees and scribes asked him: “Why do your disciples not observe the tradition of the men of former times, but they eat their meal with defiled hands?”","He said to them: “Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.","It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.’","You let go of the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men.”","Further, he said to them: “You skillfully disregard the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.","For example, Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Let the one who speaks abusively of  his father or mother be put to death.’","But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or his mother: “Whatever I have that could benefit you is corban (that is, a gift dedicated to God),”’","you no longer  let him do a single thing for his father or his mother.","Thus you make the word of God invalid by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.”","So calling the crowd to him again, he said to them: “Listen to me, all of you, and understand the meaning.","Nothing from outside a man that enters into him can defile him; but the things that come out of a man are the things that defile him.”","——","Now when he had entered a house away from the crowd, his disciples began to question him about the illustration.","So he said to them: “Are you also without understanding like them? Are you not aware that nothing from outside that enters into a man can defile him,","since it enters, not into his heart, but into his stomach, and it passes out into the sewer?” Thus he declared all foods clean.","Further, he said: “That which comes out of a man is what defiles him.","For from inside, out of the heart of men, come injurious reasonings: sexual immorality,  thefts, murders,","acts of adultery, greed, acts of wickedness, deceit, brazen conduct,  an envious eye, blasphemy, haughtiness, and unreasonableness.","All these wicked things come from within and defile a man.”","He rose up from there and went into the region of Tyre and Siʹdon. There he entered into a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice.","Immediately, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.","The woman was a Greek, a Sy·ro·phoe·niʹcian by nationality;  and she kept asking him to expel the demon from her daughter.","But he said to her: “First let the children be satisfied, for it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.”","But she replied to him: “Yes, sir, and yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat of the crumbs of the little children.”","At that he said to her: “Because you said this, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”","So she went away to her home and found the young child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.","When Jesus returned from the region of Tyre, he went through Siʹdon to the Sea of Galʹi·lee, through the region of De·capʹo·lis.","Here they brought him a deaf man with a speech impediment, and they pleaded with him to lay his hand on him.","And he took him aside privately, away from the crowd. Then he put his fingers into the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.","And looking up into heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him:  “Ephʹpha·tha,”  that is, “Be opened.”","At this his ears were opened, and his speech impediment was removed, and he began speaking normally.","With that he ordered them not to tell anyone, but the more he would order them, the more they would proclaim it.","Indeed, they were astounded beyond measure, and they said: “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the speechless speak.”"],["In those days, there was again a large crowd, and they had nothing to eat. So he summoned the disciples and said to them:","“I feel pity for the crowd, because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have nothing to eat.","If I send them off to their homes hungry,  they will give out on the road, and some of them are from far away.”","But his disciples answered him: “From where will anyone get enough bread in this isolated place to satisfy these people?”","At this he asked them: “How many loaves do you have?” They said: “Seven.”","And he instructed the crowd to recline on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them, and began giving them to his disciples to serve, and they served them to the crowd.","They also had a few small fish, and blessing these, he told them to serve these also.","So they ate and were satisfied, and they took up seven large baskets  full of leftover fragments.","Now there were about 4,000 men. Then he sent them away.","Immediately he boarded the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dal·ma·nuʹtha.","Here the Pharisees came and started disputing with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven, to put him to the test.","So he sighed deeply in his spirit and said: “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say, no sign will be given to this generation.”","With that he left them, got aboard again, and went to the opposite shore.","However, they forgot to take bread along, and they had nothing with them in the boat except for one loaf.","And he warned them in no uncertain terms: “Keep your eyes open; look out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”","So they began arguing with one another over the fact that they had no bread.","Noting this, he said to them: “Why do you argue over your having no bread? Do you not yet perceive and understand? Are your hearts still dull in understanding?","‘Though having eyes, do you not see; and though having ears, do you not hear?’ Do you not remember","when I broke the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets full of fragments you collected?” They said to him: “Twelve.”","“When I broke the seven loaves for the 4,000 men, how many large baskets  full of fragments did you take up?” And they said to him: “Seven.”","With that he said to them: “Do you not yet understand?”","Now they put in at Beth·saʹi·da. Here people brought him a blind man, and they pleaded with him to touch him.","And he took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside the village. After spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked him: “Do you see anything?”","The man looked up and said: “I see people, but they look like trees walking about.”","Again he laid his hands on the man’s eyes, and the man saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he could see everything distinctly.","So he sent him home, saying: “Do not enter into the village.”","Jesus and his disciples now left for the villages of Caes·a·reʹa Phi·lipʹpi, and on the way he began to question his disciples, saying: “Who are people saying that I am?”","They said to him: “John the Baptist,  but others say E·liʹjah, and still others, one of the prophets.”","And he put the question to them: “You, though, who do you say I am?” Peter answered him: “You are the Christ.”","At that he strictly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.","Also, he began teaching them that the Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and rise three days later.","Indeed, he was making that statement openly. But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.","At this he turned, looked at his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying: “Get behind me, Satan! because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”","He now called the crowd to him with his disciples and said to them: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake  and keep following me.","For whoever wants to save his life  will lose it, but whoever loses his life  for my sake and for the sake of the good news will save it.","Really, what good will it do a man to gain the whole world and to lose his life?","What, really, would a man give in exchange for his life?","For whoever becomes ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous  and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”"],["Furthermore, he said to them: “Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God already having come in power.”","Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them;","his outer garments began to glisten, becoming far whiter than any clothes cleaner on earth could whiten them.","Also, E·liʹjah with Moses appeared to them, and they were conversing with Jesus.","Then Peter said to Jesus: “Rabbi, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.”","In fact, he did not know how to react, for they were quite fearful.","And a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: “This is my Son, the beloved. Listen to him.”","Then suddenly they looked around and saw that no one was with them any longer except Jesus.","As they were coming down from the mountain, he strictly ordered them not to relate to anybody what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.","They took the word to heart,  but discussed among themselves what this rising from the dead meant.","And they began to question him, saying: “Why do the scribes say that E·liʹjah must come first?”","He said to them: “E·liʹjah does come first and restore all things; but how is it that it is written about the Son of man that he must undergo many sufferings and be treated with contempt?","But I say to you that E·liʹjah, in fact, has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”","When they came to the other disciples, they noticed a large crowd around them,  and there were scribes arguing with them.","But as soon as all the crowd caught sight of him, they were astonished, and they ran up to him to greet him.","So he asked them: “What are you arguing about with them?”","And one of the crowd answered him: “Teacher, I brought my son to you because he has a speechless spirit.","Wherever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and loses his strength. I asked your disciples to expel it, but they were not able to do so.”","In response he said to them: “O faithless generation, how long must I continue with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.”","So they brought the boy to him, but at the sight of him, the spirit at once threw the child into convulsions. After falling on the ground, he kept rolling about, foaming at the mouth.","Then Jesus asked the father: “How long has this been happening to him?” He said: “From childhood on,","and often it would throw him into the fire and also into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.”","Jesus said to him: “That expression, ‘If you can’! Why, all things are possible for the one who has faith.”","Immediately the child’s father cried out and said: “I have faith! Help me out where I need faith!”","Jesus, now noticing that a crowd was rushing toward them, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it: “You speechless and deaf spirit, I order you, get out of him and do not enter into him again!”","After crying out and going through many convulsions, it came out, and the child seemed to be dead, so that most of the people were saying: “He is dead!”","But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and he stood up.","So after he entered into a house, his disciples asked him privately: “Why could we not expel it?”","He said to them: “This kind can come out only by prayer.”","They departed from there and went through Galʹi·lee, but he did not want anyone to get to know about it.","For he was teaching his disciples and telling them: “The Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands, and they will kill him, but despite being killed, he will rise three days later.”","However, they did not understand his statement, and they were afraid to question him.","And they came into Ca·perʹna·um. Now when he was inside the house, he put the question to them: “What were you arguing about on the road?”","They kept silent, for on the road they had been arguing among themselves about who is greater.","So he sat down and called the Twelve and said to them: “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and minister of all.”","Then he took a young child and stood him in their midst; and putting his arms around him, he said to them:","“Whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me receives not me only but also Him who sent me.”","John said to him: “Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he was not following us.”","But Jesus said: “Do not try to prevent him, for there is no one who will do a powerful work on the basis of my name who will quickly be able to say anything  bad about me.","For whoever is not against us is for us.","And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, I tell you truly, he will by no means lose his reward.","But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith, it would be better for him if a millstone that is turned by a donkey were put around his neck and he were pitched into the sea.","“If ever your hand makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to go off with two hands into Ge·henʹna,  into the fire that cannot be put out.","——","And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with two feet into Ge·henʹna.","——","And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away. It is better for you to enter one-eyed into the Kingdom of God than to be thrown with two eyes into Ge·henʹna,","where the maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.","“For everyone must be salted with fire.","Salt is fine, but if the salt ever loses its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace with one another.”"],["From there he got up and came to the borders  of Ju·deʹa across the Jordan, and again crowds gathered to him. As he was accustomed to do, he again began teaching them.","And Pharisees approached, intent on testing him, and they asked whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.","He answered them: “What did Moses command you?”","They said: “Moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her.”","But Jesus said to them: “Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, he wrote this commandment for you.","However, from the beginning of creation, ‘He made them male and female.","For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother,","and the two will be one flesh,’ so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.","Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.”","When they were again in the house, the disciples began to question him about this.","He said to them: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,","and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.”","People now began bringing him young children for him to touch them, but the disciples reprimanded them.","At seeing this, Jesus was indignant and said to them: “Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones.","Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.”","And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them, laying his hands on them.","As he was going on his way, a man ran up and fell on his knees before him and put the question to him: “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit everlasting life?”","Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one, God.","You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor  your father and your mother.’”","The man said to him: “Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth on.”","Jesus looked at him and felt love for him and said, “One thing is missing about you: Go, sell what things you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.”","But he grew sad at the answer and went away grieved, for he had many possessions.","After looking around, Jesus said to his disciples: “How difficult it will be for those with money to enter into the Kingdom of God!”","But the disciples were surprised at his words. Jesus then responded: “Children, how difficult it is to enter into the Kingdom of God!","It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”","They became still more astounded and said to him:  “Who possibly can be saved?”","Looking straight at them, Jesus said: “With men it is impossible but not so with God, for all things are possible with God.”","Peter began to say to him: “Look! We have left all things and followed you.”","Jesus said: “Truly I say to you, no one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news","who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the coming system of things,  everlasting life.","But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”","Now they were going on the road up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were astonished, but those who followed began to fear. Once again he took the Twelve aside and started to tell them these things that were about to happen to him:","“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations,","and these will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him, but three days later he will rise.”","James and John, the sons of Zebʹe·dee, approached him and said to him: “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”","He said to them: “What do you want me to do for you?”","They replied: “Grant us to sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”","But Jesus said to them: “You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am drinking or be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized?”","They said to him: “We can.” At that Jesus said to them: “The cup I am drinking, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized, you will be baptized.","However, to sit down at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared.”","When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at James and John.","But Jesus called them to him and said to them: “You know that those who appear to be  ruling the  nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them.","This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,","and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all.","For even the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life  as a ransom in exchange for many.”","They then came into Jerʹi·cho. But as he and his disciples and a considerable crowd were going out of Jerʹi·cho, Bar·ti·maeʹus (the son of Ti·maeʹus), a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.","When he heard that it was Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ, he started shouting and saying: “Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!”","At this many began rebuking him, telling him to be silent, but all the more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”","So Jesus stopped and said: “Call him to me.” So they called the blind man, saying to him: “Take courage! Get up; he is calling you.”","Throwing off his outer garment, he leaped to his feet and went to Jesus.","Then Jesus said to him: “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him:  “Rab·boʹni,  let me recover my sight.”","And Jesus said to him: “Go. Your faith has made you well.” And immediately he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him on the road."],["Now when they were getting near to Jerusalem, to Bethʹpha·ge and Bethʹa·ny at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples","and told them: “Go into the village that is within sight, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied on which no man has sat until now. Untie it and bring it here.","And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away.’”","So they went away and found the colt tied at a door, outside on the side street, and they untied it.","But some of those standing there said to them: “What are you doing untying the colt?”","They told them just what Jesus had said, and they let them go.","And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they put their outer garments on it, and he sat on it.","Also, many spread their outer garments on the road, but others cut down foliage from the fields.","And those going in front and those coming behind kept shouting: “Save, we pray! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s  name!","Blessed is the coming Kingdom of our father David! Save, we pray, in the heights above!”","And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple, and he looked around at everything, but since the hour was already late, he went out to Bethʹa·ny with the Twelve.","The next day when they were leaving Bethʹa·ny, he felt hungry.","From a distance he caught sight of a fig tree that had leaves, and he went to see whether he could find something on it. But on coming to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.","So he said to it: “Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.” And his disciples were listening.","They now came to Jerusalem. There he entered the temple and started to throw out those selling and buying in the  temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,","and he would not let anyone carry a utensil through the temple.","He was teaching and saying to them: “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a cave of robbers.”","And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they began to seek how to kill him; for they were in fear of him, because all the crowd was astounded at his teaching.","When it became late in the day, they went out of the city.","But when they were passing by early in the morning, they saw the fig tree already withered from its roots.","Peter, remembering it, said to him: “Rabbi, see! the fig tree that you cursed has withered.”","In reply Jesus said to them: “Have faith in God.","Truly I say to you that whoever tells this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says is going to happen, he will have it happen.","This is why I tell you, all the things you pray and ask for, have faith that you have received them, and you will have them.","And when you stand praying, forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses.”","——","They came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came","and said to him: “By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”","Jesus said to them: “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.","Was the baptism by John from heaven or from men?  Answer me.”","So they began to reason among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why, then, did you not believe him?’","But dare we say, ‘From men’?” They were in fear of the crowd, for these all held that John had really been a prophet.","So they answered Jesus: “We do not know.” Jesus said to them: “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”"],["Then he started to speak to them with illustrations: “A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad.","In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them.","But they took him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.","Again he sent another slave to them, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored.","And he sent another, and that one they killed, and many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed.","One more he had, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’","But those cultivators said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’","So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.","What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill the cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.","Did you never read  this scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone.","This has come from Jehovah,  and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”","At that they wanted to seize  him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that he spoke the illustration with them in mind. So they left him and went away.","Next they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the party followers of Herod in order to catch him in his speech.","On arriving, these said to him: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and you do not seek anyone’s favor, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people, but you teach the way of God in line with truth. Is it lawful  to pay head tax to Caesar or not?","Should we pay, or should we not pay?” Detecting their hypocrisy, he said to them: “Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a de·narʹi·us  to look at.”","They brought one, and he said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?” They said to him: “Caesar’s.”","Jesus then said: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” And they were amazed at him.","Now the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him:","“Teacher, Moses wrote us that if someone’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind but does not leave a child, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.","There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, but when he died he left no offspring.","And the second married her but died without leaving offspring, and the third the same way.","And all seven left no offspring. Last of all, the woman also died.","In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”","Jesus said to them: “Is not this why you are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?","For when they rise from the dead, neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in the heavens.","But concerning the dead being raised up, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the thornbush, that God said to him: ‘I am the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob’?","He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken.”","One of the scribes who had come up and heard them disputing, knowing that he had answered them in a fine way, asked him: “Which commandment is first  of all?”","Jesus answered: “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel, Jehovah  our God is one Jehovah,","and you must love Jehovah  your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul  and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.’","The second is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”","The scribe said to him: “Teacher, you spoke well, in line with truth, ‘He is One, and there is no other besides him’;","and to love him with one’s whole heart, with one’s whole understanding, and with one’s whole strength and  to love one’s neighbor as oneself is worth far more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”","At this Jesus, discerning that he had answered intelligently, said to him: “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.” But no one had the courage to question him anymore.","However, as Jesus continued teaching in the temple, he said: “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son?","By the holy spirit, David himself said, ‘Jehovah  said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.”’","David himself calls him Lord, so how can it be that he is his son?”","And in his teaching he went on to say: “Beware of the scribes who want to walk around in robes and want greetings in the marketplaces","and front  seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals.","They devour the houses  of the widows, and for show  they make long prayers. These will receive a more severe  judgment.”","And he sat down with the treasury chests  in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests, and many rich people were dropping in many coins.","Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value.","So he called his disciples to him and said to them: “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests.","For they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want,  put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”"],["As he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: “Teacher, see! what wonderful stones and buildings!”","However, Jesus said to him: “Do you see these great buildings? By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.”","As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately:","“Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion?”","So Jesus began to tell them: “Look out that nobody misleads you.","Many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and will mislead many.","Moreover, when you hear of wars and reports of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet.","“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in one place after another; there will also be food shortages. These are a beginning of pangs of distress.","“As for you, look out for yourselves. People will hand you over to local courts, and you will be beaten in synagogues and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them.","Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.","And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say; but whatever is given you in that hour, say this, for you are not the ones speaking,  but the holy spirit is.","Furthermore, brother will deliver brother over to death, and a father a child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.","And you will be hated by all people on account of my name. But the one who has endured  to the end will be saved.","“However, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader use discernment), then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing to the mountains.","Let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house;","and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment.","Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days!","Keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime;","for those days will be days of a tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time, and will not occur again.","In fact, unless Jehovah  had cut short the days, no flesh would be saved. But on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen, he has cut short the days.","“Then, too, if anyone says to you, ‘See! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘See! There he is,’ do not believe it.","For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones.","You, then, watch out. I have told you all things beforehand.","“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,","and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.","“Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.","Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near at the doors.","Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.","“Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father.","Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is.","It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.","Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day or at midnight or before dawn  or early in the morning,","in order that when he comes suddenly, he does not find you sleeping.","But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep on the watch.”"],["Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread was two days later. And the chief priests and the scribes  were looking for a way to seize  him by cunning  and kill him;","for they were saying: “Not at the festival; perhaps there might be an uproar of the people.”","And while he was at Bethʹa·ny dining  in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very expensive. She broke open the alabaster jar and began pouring it on his head.","At this some said to one another indignantly: “Why has this perfumed oil been wasted?","For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than 300 de·narʹi·i  and the money given to the poor!” And they were greatly annoyed with  her.","But Jesus said: “Let her alone. Why do you try to make trouble for her? She did a fine deed toward me.","For you always have the poor with you, and you can do them good whenever you want to, but you will not always have me.","She did what she could; she poured perfumed oil on my body beforehand, in view of the burial.","Truly I say to you, wherever the good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.”","And Judas Is·carʹi·ot, one of the Twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.","When they heard it, they were delighted and promised to give him silver money. So he began seeking an opportunity to betray him.","Now on the first day of the Unleavened Bread, when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice, his disciples said to him: “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”","With that he sent two of his disciples and said to them: “Go into the city, and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him,","and wherever he goes inside, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says: “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’","And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Prepare it for us there.”","So the disciples went out, and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them, and they prepared for the Passover.","After evening had fallen, he came with the Twelve.","And as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said: “Truly I say to you, one of you who is eating with me will betray me.”","They began to be grieved and to say to him one by one: “It is not I, is it?”","He said to them: “It is one of the Twelve, the one dipping with me into the bowl.","For the Son of man is going away, just as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”","And as they continued eating, he took a loaf, said a blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “Take it; this means my body.”","And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, and they all drank out of it.","And he said to them: “This means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many.","Truly I say to you, I will by no means drink anymore of the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.”","Finally, after singing  praises,  they went out to the Mount of Olives.","And Jesus said to them: “You will all be stumbled, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered about.’","But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galʹi·lee.”","But Peter said to him: “Even if all the others are stumbled, I will not be.”","At that Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you that today, yes, on this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.”","But he kept insisting: “If I have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” Also, all the others began to say the same thing.","So they came to a spot named Geth·semʹa·ne, and he said to his disciples: “Sit down here while I pray.”","And he took Peter and James and John along with him, and he began to feel deeply distressed  and to be greatly troubled.","He said to them: “I am  deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch.”","And going a little way forward, he fell to the ground and began praying that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.","And he said:  “Abba,  Father, all things are possible for you; remove this cup from me. Yet, not what I want, but what you want.”","He returned and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: “Simon, are you sleeping? Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour?","Keep on the watch and pray continually, so that you do not come into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager,  but the flesh is weak.”","And he went away again and prayed, saying the same thing.","And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, so they did not know what to answer him.","And he returned the third time and said to them: “At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting! It is enough! The hour has come! Look! The Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.”","And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.","Now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign, saying: “Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one; take him into custody, and lead him away under guard.”","And he came straight up and approached him and said, “Rabbi!” and gave him a tender kiss.","So they seized him and took him into custody.","However, one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.","But in response Jesus said to them: “Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber?","Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into custody. Nevertheless, this is to fulfill the Scriptures.”","And they all abandoned him and fled.","However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby, and they tried to seize him,","but he left his linen  garment behind and got away naked.","They now led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled.","But Peter, from a good distance, followed him as far as into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting together with the house attendants and warming himself before a bright fire.","Now the chief priests and the entire Sanʹhe·drin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they were not finding any.","Many, indeed, were giving false witness against him, but their testimonies were not in agreement.","Also, certain ones were standing up and bearing false witness against him, saying:","“We heard him say, ‘I will throw down this temple that was made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.’”","But even on these grounds, their testimony was not in agreement.","Then the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned Jesus, saying: “Do you say nothing in reply? What is it these men are testifying against you?”","But he kept silent and made no reply at all. Again the high priest began to question him and said to him: “Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One?”","Then Jesus said: “I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”","At this the high priest ripped his garments and said: “What further need do we have of witnesses?","You heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?”  They all condemned him as deserving of death.","And some started to spit on him and to cover his face and hit him with their fists and say to him: “Prophesy!” And slapping him in the face, the court attendants took him.","Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.","On seeing Peter warming himself, she looked straight at him and said: “You too were with the Naz·a·reneʹ, this Jesus.”","But he denied it, saying: “Neither do I know him nor do I understand what you are talking about,” and he went outside to the entryway.","There the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by: “This is one of them.”","Again he was denying it. And after a little while, those standing by again began saying to Peter: “Certainly you are one of them, for you are, in fact, a Gal·i·leʹan.”","But he started to curse and swear: “I do not know this man of whom you speak!”","Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.” And he broke down and began to weep."],["Immediately at dawn, the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, indeed, the whole Sanʹhe·drin, consulted together, and they bound Jesus and led him off and handed him over to Pilate.","So Pilate put the question to him: “Are you the King of the Jews?” In answer he said: “You yourself say it.”","But the chief priests were accusing him of many things.","Now Pilate began questioning him again, saying: “Have you no reply to make? See how  many charges they are bringing against you.”","But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.","Well, from festival to festival, he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested.","At the time the man named Bar·abʹbas was in prison with the seditionists, who in their sedition had committed murder.","So the crowd came up and began to make their request according to what Pilate used to do for them.","He responded to them, saying: “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”","For Pilate was aware that out of envy the chief priests had handed him over.","But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Bar·abʹbas to them instead.","Again in reply Pilate said to them: “What, then, should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?”","Once more they cried out: “To the stake with him!”","But Pilate went on to say to them: “Why? What bad thing did he do?” Still they cried out all the more: “To the stake with him!”","At that Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Bar·abʹbas to them; and after having Jesus whipped, he handed him over to be executed on the stake.","The soldiers now led him off into the courtyard, that is, into the governor’s residence, and they called the whole body of troops together.","And they dressed him in purple and braided a crown of thorns and put it on him;","and they began to call out to him: “Greetings,  you King of the Jews!”","Also, they were hitting him on the head with a reed and spitting on him, and they got on their knees and bowed down  to him.","Finally, after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple and put his outer garments on him. And they led him out to nail him to the stake.","Also, they compelled into service a passerby, a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne, coming from the countryside, the father of Alexander and Ruʹfus, to carry his torture stake.","So they brought him to the place called  Golʹgo·tha,  which means, when translated, “Skull Place.”","Here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh, but he would not take it.","And they nailed him to the stake and distributed his outer garments by casting lots over them to decide who would take what.","It was now the third hour,  and they nailed him to the stake.","And the inscription of the charge against him was written: “The King of the Jews.”","Moreover, they put two robbers on stakes alongside him, one on his right and one on his left.","——","And those passing by spoke abusively to him, shaking their heads and saying: “Ha! You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days,","save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.”","In the same way also, the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves, saying: “Others he saved; himself he cannot save!","Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down off the torture stake,  so that we may see and believe.” Even those who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him.","When it became the sixth hour,  a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.","And at the ninth hour, Jesus called out with a loud voice:  “Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?”  which means, when translated: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”","And some of those standing near, on hearing it, began to say: “See! He is calling E·liʹjah.”","Then someone ran, soaked a sponge in sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying: “Let him be! Let us see whether E·liʹjah comes to take him down.”","But Jesus let out a loud cry and expired.","And the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.","Now when the army officer who was standing by with him in view saw that he had expired under these circumstances, he said: “Certainly this man was God’s Son.”","There were also women watching from a distance, among them Mary Magʹda·lene as well as Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joʹses, and Sa·loʹme,","who used to accompany him and minister to him when he was in Galʹi·lee, and many other women who had come up together with him to Jerusalem.","Now as it was already late in the afternoon, and since it was Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,","there came Joseph of Ar·i·ma·theʹa, a reputable member of the Council, who also himself was waiting for the Kingdom of God. He took courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.","But Pilate wondered whether he could already be dead, and summoning the army officer, he asked him whether Jesus had already died.","So after making certain from the army officer, he granted the body to Joseph.","After he bought fine linen and took him down, he wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him in a tomb  that was quarried out of rock; then he rolled a stone up to the entrance of the tomb.","But Mary Magʹda·lene and Mary the mother of Joʹses continued looking at where he had been laid."],["So when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magʹda·lene, Mary the mother of James, and Sa·loʹme bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body.","And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen, they came to the tomb.","They were saying to one another: “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?”","But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was very large.","When they entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were stunned.","He said to them: “Do not be stunned. You are looking for Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ who was executed on the stake. He was raised up. He is not here. Look, here is the place where they laid him.","But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee. You will see him there, just as he told you.’”","So when they came out, they fled from the tomb, trembling and overwhelmed with emotion. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were in fear."]],"Luke":[["Seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence  among us,","just as these were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the message,","I resolved also, because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them to you in logical order, most excellent The·ophʹi·lus,","so that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally.","In the days of Herod,  king of Ju·deʹa, there was a priest named Zech·a·riʹah of the division of A·biʹjah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.","They both were righteous before God, walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah.","But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well along in years.","Now as he was serving as priest in the assignment of his division before God,","according to the established practice  of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah.","And the entire multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense.","Jehovah’s  angel appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.","But Zech·a·riʹah became troubled at the sight, and he was overcome with fear.","However, the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zech·a·riʹah, because your supplication has been favorably heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.","You will have joy and great gladness, and many will rejoice over his birth,","for he will be great in the sight of Jehovah.  But he must drink no wine or any alcoholic drink at all, and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth,","and he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Jehovah  their God.","Also, he will go ahead of him with E·liʹjah’s spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, in order to get ready for Jehovah  a prepared people.”","Zech·a·riʹah said to the angel: “How can I be sure of this? For I am old, and my wife is well along in years.”","In reply the angel said to him: “I am Gaʹbri·el, who stands near before God, and I was sent to speak with you and to declare this good news to you.","But look! you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their appointed time.”","Meanwhile, the people continued waiting for Zech·a·riʹah, and they were surprised that he delayed so long in the sanctuary.","When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight  in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless.","When the days of his holy service  were completed, he went off to his home.","Some days later Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and  she kept herself secluded for five months, saying:","“This is how Jehovah  has dealt with me in these days. He has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men.”","In her sixth month, the angel Gaʹbri·el was sent from God to a city of Galʹi·lee named Nazʹa·reth,","to a virgin promised in marriage  to a man named Joseph of David’s house, and the name of the virgin was Mary.","And coming in, the angel said to her: “Greetings, you highly favored one, Jehovah  is with you.”","But she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be.","So the angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.","And look! you will become pregnant  and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.","This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and Jehovah  God will give him the throne of David his father,","and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his Kingdom.”","But Mary said to the angel: “How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?”","In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son.","And look! Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her, the so-called barren woman;","for no declaration  will be impossible for God.”","Then Mary said: “Look! Jehovah’s  slave girl! May it happen to me according to your declaration.” At that the angel departed from her.","So Mary set out in those days and traveled with haste into the mountainous country, to a city of Judah,","and she entered the home of Zech·a·riʹah and greeted Elizabeth.","Well, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit","and loudly cried out: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruitage of your womb!","So how is it that this privilege is mine, to have the mother of my Lord come to me?","For look! as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.","Happy too is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from Jehovah.”","And Mary said: “My soul  magnifies Jehovah,","and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at God my Savior,","because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl. For look! from now on all generations will declare me happy,","because the powerful One has done great deeds for me, and holy is his name,","and for generation after generation his mercy is upon those who fear him.","He has acted mightily with his arm; he has scattered those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts.","He has brought down powerful men from thrones and has exalted lowly ones;","he has fully satisfied hungry ones with  good things and has sent away empty-handed those who had wealth.","He has come to the aid of Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,","just as he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his offspring,  forever.”","Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home.","The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son.","And the neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah  had magnified his mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.","On the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child, and they were going to name him after his father, Zech·a·riʹah.","But his mother said in reply: “No! but he will be called John.”","At this they said to her: “Not one of your relatives is called by this name.”","Then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called.","So he asked for a tablet and wrote: “John is his name.” At this they were all amazed.","Instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue was set free and he began to speak, praising God.","And fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood, and all these things began to be talked about in the whole mountainous country of Ju·deʹa.","And all who heard noted it in their hearts, saying: “What will this young child turn out to be?” For the hand of Jehovah  was indeed with him.","Then Zech·a·riʹah his father was filled with holy spirit, and he prophesied, saying:","“Let Jehovah  be praised, the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance.","And he has raised up a horn of salvation  for us in the house of David his servant,","just as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,","of a salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us;","to show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant,","the oath that he swore to Abraham our forefather,","to grant us, after we have been rescued from the hands of enemies, the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him","with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days.","But as for you, young child, you will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go ahead of Jehovah  to prepare his ways,","to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins,","because of the tender compassion of our God. With this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high,","to give light to those sitting in darkness and death’s shadow and to guide our feet in the way of peace.”","And the young child grew up and became strong in spirit, and he continued in the desert until the day he showed himself openly to Israel."],["Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Au·gusʹtus for all the inhabited earth to be registered.","(This first registration took place when Qui·rinʹi·us was governor of Syria.)","And all the people went to be registered, each one to his own city.","Of course, Joseph also went up from Galʹi·lee, from the city of Nazʹa·reth, into Ju·deʹa, to David’s city, which is called Bethʹle·hem, because  of his being a member of the house and family of David.","He went to get registered with Mary, who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth.","While they were there, the time came for her to give birth.","And she gave birth to her son, the firstborn, and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the lodging place.","There were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks.","Suddenly Jehovah’s  angel stood before them, and Jehovah’s  glory gleamed around them, and they became very fearful.","But the angel said to them: “Do not be afraid, for look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have.","For today there was born to you in David’s city a savior, who is Christ the Lord.","And this is a sign for you: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”","Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying:","“Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of goodwill.”","So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: “Let us by all means go over to Bethʹle·hem and see what has taken place, which Jehovah  has made known to us.”","And they went quickly and found Mary as well as Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.","When they saw this, they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child.","And all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them,","but Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart.","Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.","After eight days, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived.","Also, when the time came for purifying them according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah,","just as it is written in Jehovah’s  Law: “Every firstborn male  must be called holy to Jehovah.”","And they offered a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of Jehovah:  “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”","And look! there was a man in Jerusalem named Simʹe·on, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for Israel’s consolation, and holy spirit was upon him.","Furthermore, it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah.","Under the power of the spirit, he now came into the temple, and as the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the Law,","he took the child into his arms and praised God and said:","“Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration,","because my eyes have seen your means of salvation","that you  have prepared in the sight of all the peoples,","a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.”","And the child’s father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him.","Also, Simʹe·on blessed them and said to Mary, the child’s mother: “Look!

Here your father and I have been frantically looking for you.”","But he said to them: “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father?”","However, they did not understand what he was saying to them.","Then he went down with them and returned to Nazʹa·reth, and he continued subject  to them. Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart.","And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men."],["In the 15th year of the reign of Ti·beʹri·us Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Ju·deʹa, Herod  was district ruler  of Galʹi·lee, Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of It·u·raeʹa and Trach·o·niʹtis, and Ly·saʹni·as was district  ruler of Ab·i·leʹne,","in the days of chief priest Anʹnas and of Caʹia·phas, God’s declaration came to John the son of Zech·a·riʹah in the wilderness.","So he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins,","just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah!

Do not start saying to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.","Indeed, the ax is already lying at the root of the trees.

He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire.","His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”","He also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people.","But Herod the district ruler, because of being reproved by John concerning He·roʹdi·as the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod had done,","added this also to all those deeds: He locked John up in prison.","Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus too was baptized. As he was praying, the heaven was opened up,","and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.”","When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old, being the son, as the opinion was,","24  son of Matʹthat,","son of Mat·ta·thiʹas,","son of Maʹath,","son of Jo·anʹan,","son of Melʹchi,","son of Jesus,","son of Symʹe·on,","son of Meʹle·a,","son of Jesʹse,","son of Am·minʹa·dab,","son of Jacob,","son of Seʹrug,","son of Ca·iʹnan,","son of Me·thuʹse·lah,","son of Eʹnosh,"],["Then Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan, and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness","for 40 days, being tempted by the Devil.

And good reports about him spread throughout all the surrounding country.","Also, he began to teach in their synagogues, and he was held in honor by all.","He then went to Nazʹa·reth, where he had been brought up, and according to his custom on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and stood up to read.","So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written:","“Jehovah’s  spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away free,","to preach Jehovah’s  acceptable year.”","With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him.","Then he began to say to them: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.”","And they all began to give favorable witness about him and to be amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth, and they were saying: “This is a son of Joseph, is it not?”","At this he said to them: “No doubt you will apply this saying to me, ‘Physician, cure yourself. Do also here in your home territory the things we have heard were done in Ca·perʹna·um.’”","So he said: “Truly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory.","For instance, I tell you in truth: There were many widows in Israel in the days of E·liʹjah when heaven was shut up for three years and six months, and a great famine came on all the land.","Yet E·liʹjah was sent to none of those women, but only to a widow in Zarʹe·phath in the land of Siʹdon.","Also, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of E·liʹsha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed,  only Naʹa·man the Syrian.”","Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger,","and they rose up and rushed him outside the city, and they led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city had been built, in order to throw him down headlong.","But he went right through their midst and continued on his way.","He then went down to Ca·perʹna·um, a city of Galʹi·lee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath,","and they were astounded at his way of teaching, because he spoke with authority.","Now in the synagogue there was a man with a  spirit, an unclean demon, and he shouted with a loud voice:","“Ah! What have we to do with you, Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ? Did you come to destroy us? I know exactly who you are, the Holy One of God.”","But Jesus rebuked it, saying: “Be silent, and come out of him.” So after throwing the man down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him.","At this they were all astonished and began to say to one another: “What kind of speech is this? For with authority and power he orders the unclean spirits, and out they come!”","So the news about him kept spreading into every corner of the surrounding country.","After leaving the synagogue, he entered into Simon’s home. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they asked him to help her.","So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Instantly she got up and began ministering to them.","But when the sun was setting, all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. By laying his hands on each one of them, he cured them.","Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying: “You are the Son of God.” But rebuking them, he would not permit them to speak, for they knew him to be the Christ.","However, at daybreak he departed and went to an isolated place. But the crowds began searching  for him and came to where he was, and they tried to keep him from going away from them.","But he said to them: “I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent.”","So he went on preaching in the synagogues of Ju·deʹa."],["On one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gen·nesʹa·ret.","And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside, but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets.","Going aboard one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to pull away a bit from land. Then he sat down, and he began teaching the crowds from the boat.","When he stopped speaking, he said to Simon: “Pull out to where it is deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”","But in reply Simon said: “Instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing, but at your word I will lower the nets.”","Well, when they did this, they caught  a great number of fish. In fact, their nets began ripping apart.","So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them, and they came and filled both boats, so that these began to sink.","Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying: “Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man.”","For both he and those with him were overwhelmed with astonishment at the catch of fish they had taken,","and the same was true of both James and John, Zebʹe·dee’s sons, who were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon: “Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching men  alive.”","So they brought the boats back to land and abandoned everything and followed him.","On another occasion while he was in one of the cities, look! there was a man full of leprosy! When he caught sight of Jesus, he fell facedown and begged him: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.”","So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to! Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy vanished from him.","Then he gave the man orders to tell no one: “But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses directed, for a witness to them.”","But the news about him just kept spreading, and large crowds would gather together to listen and to be cured of their sicknesses.","However, he often went into the desolate areas to pray.","On one of those days while he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come out of every village of Galʹi·lee and Ju·deʹa and from Jerusalem were sitting there; and Jehovah’s  power was with him to do healing.","And look! men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher, and they were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus.","So not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they climbed up to the roof, and they lowered him on the stretcher through the tiling, right among those in front of Jesus.","When he saw their faith, he said: “Man, your sins are forgiven.”","Then the scribes and the Pharisees started to reason, saying: “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?”","But Jesus, discerning their reasoning, said in answer to them: “What are you reasoning in your hearts?","Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?","But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” he said to the paralyzed man: “I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”","At that he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, glorifying God.","Then one and all were seized with amazement, and they began to glorify God, and they became filled with awe, saying: “We have seen wonderful things today!”","Now after this, he went out and saw a tax collector named Leʹvi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.”","And leaving everything behind, he rose up and began to follow him.","Then Leʹvi spread a big reception feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were dining  with them.","At this the Pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples, saying: “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”","In reply Jesus said to them: “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.","I have come to call, not righteous people, but sinners to repentance.”","They said to him: “John’s disciples fast frequently and offer supplications, and so do those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”","Jesus said to them: “You cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?","But days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from  them; then they will fast in those days.”","He also gave an illustration to them: “Nobody cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, then the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old.","Also, no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined.","But new wine must be put into new wineskins.","No one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, ‘The old is nice.’”"],["Now on a sabbath he was passing through grainfields, and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them with their hands.","At this some of the Pharisees said: “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”","But in reply Jesus said to them: “Have you never read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry?","How he entered into the house of God and received the loaves of presentation  and ate and gave some to the men with him, which it is not lawful for anyone to eat but for the priests only?”","Then he said to them: “The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.”","On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and began teaching. And a man was there whose right hand was withered.","The scribes and the Pharisees were now watching Jesus closely to see whether he would cure on the Sabbath, in order to find some way to accuse him.","He, however, knew their reasoning, so he said to the man with the withered  hand: “Get up and stand in the center.” And he rose and stood there.","Then Jesus said to them: “I ask you men, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life  or to destroy it?”","After looking around at them all, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored.","But they flew into a senseless rage, and they began to talk over with one another what they might do to Jesus.","On one of those days he went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.","And when it became day, he called his disciples to him and chose from among them 12, whom he also named apostles:","Simon, whom he also named Peter, Andrew his brother, James, John, Philip, Bar·tholʹo·mew,","Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, Simon who is called “the zealous one,”","Judas the son of James, and Judas Is·carʹi·ot, who turned traitor.","And he came down with them and stood on a level place, and there was a large crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Ju·deʹa and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Siʹdon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.","Even those troubled with unclean spirits were cured.","And all the crowd were seeking to touch him, because power was going out of him and healing them all.","And he looked up at his disciples and began to say:","“Happy are you who hunger now, for you will be filled.","“Happy are you whenever men hate you, and when they exclude you and reproach you and denounce  your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.","Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for look! your reward is great in heaven, for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets.","“But woe to you who are rich, for you are having your consolation in full.","“Woe to you who are filled up now, for you will go hungry.","“Woe whenever all men speak well of you, for this is what their forefathers did to the false prophets.","“But I say to you who are listening: Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you,","to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who are insulting you.","To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your outer garment, do not withhold the inner garment either.","Give to everyone asking you, and from the one taking your things away, do not ask them back.","“Also, just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.","“If you love those loving you, of what credit is it to you? For even the sinners love those loving them.","And if you do good to those doing good to you, of what credit is it to you? Even the sinners do the same.","Also, if you lend  to those from whom you expect repayment, of what credit is it to you? Even sinners lend to sinners so that they may get back as much.","On the contrary, continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without hoping for anything back; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.","Continue being merciful, just as your Father is merciful.","“Moreover, stop judging, and you will by no means be judged; and stop condemning, and you will by no means be condemned. Keep on forgiving,  and you will be forgiven.","Practice giving, and people will give to you. They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing. For with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.”","Then he also told them an illustration: “A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Both will fall into a pit, will they not?","A student  is not above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.","Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye?","How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, allow me to remove the straw that is in your eye,’ while you yourself do not see the rafter in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw that is in your brother’s eye.","“For no fine tree produces rotten fruit, and no rotten tree produces fine fruit.","For each tree is known by its own fruit. For example, people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush.","A good man brings good out of the good treasure of his heart, but a wicked man brings what is wicked out of his wicked treasure; for out of the heart’s abundance his mouth speaks.","“Why, then, do you call me ‘Lord! Lord!’ but do not do the things I say?","Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you whom he is like:","He is like a man who in building a house dug and went down deep and laid a foundation on the rock. Consequently, when a flood came, the river dashed against that house but was not strong enough to shake it, for it was well-built.","On the other hand, whoever hears and does nothing is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The river dashed against it, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”"],["When he had completed what he had to say to the people, he entered Ca·perʹna·um.","Now an army officer’s slave, who was dear to him, was seriously ill and about to pass away.","When he heard about Jesus, he sent some elders of the Jews to him to ask him to come and make his slave well.","They came up to Jesus and began to plead with him earnestly, saying: “He is worthy of your granting him this,","for he loves our nation and he himself built our synagogue.”","So Jesus went with them. But when he was not far from the house, the army officer had already sent friends to say to him: “Sir, do not bother, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.","That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.","For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”","When Jesus heard these things, he was amazed at him, and he turned to the crowd following him and said: “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found so great a faith.”","And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.","Soon afterward he traveled to a city called Naʹin, and his disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him.","As he got near the gate of the city, why look! there was a dead man being carried out, the only  son of his mother. Besides, she was a widow. A considerable crowd from the city was also with her.","When the Lord caught sight of her, he was moved with pity for her, and he said to her: “Stop weeping.”","With that he approached and touched the bier,  and the bearers stood still. Then he said: “Young man, I say to you, get up!”","And the dead man sat up and started to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.","Now fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying: “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and, “God has turned his attention to his people.”","And this news concerning him spread out into all Ju·deʹa and all the surrounding country.","Now John’s disciples reported to him all these things.","So John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?”","When they came to him, the men said: “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect another?’”","In that hour he cured many people of sicknesses, serious diseases, and wicked spirits, and he granted many blind people the gift of sight.","In reply he said to them: “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind are now seeing, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, and the poor are being told the good news.","Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me.”","When the messengers of John had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being tossed by the wind?","What, then, did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments?  Why, those wearing splendid dress and living in luxury are in royal houses.","Really, then, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.","This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,  who will prepare your way ahead of you.’","I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John, but a lesser person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is.”","(When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be righteous, for they had been baptized with the baptism of John.","But the Pharisees and those versed in the Law disregarded the counsel  of God to them, since they had not been baptized by him.)","“With whom, therefore, should I compare the men of this generation, and whom are they like?","They are like young children sitting in a marketplace and calling out to one another, saying: ‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we wailed, but you did not weep.’","Likewise, John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, but you say: ‘He has a demon.’","The Son of man has come eating and drinking, but you say: ‘Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’","All the same, wisdom is proved righteous  by all its children.”","Now one of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. So he entered the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.","And look! a woman who was known in the city to be a sinner learned that he was dining  in the house of the Pharisee, and she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.","Taking a position behind him at his feet, she wept and began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them off with the hair of her head. Also, she tenderly kissed his feet and poured the perfumed oil on them.","Seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited him said to himself: “If this man were really a prophet, he would know who and what kind of woman it is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”","But in reply Jesus said to him: “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He said: “Teacher, say it!”","“Two men were debtors to a certain lender; the one was in debt for 500 de·narʹi·i,  but the other for 50.","When they did not have anything to pay him back with, he freely forgave them both. Therefore, which one of them will love him more?”","In answer Simon said: “I suppose it is the one whom he forgave more.” He said to him: “You judged correctly.”","With that he turned to the woman and said to Simon: “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But this woman wet my feet with her tears and wiped them off with her hair.","You gave me no kiss, but this woman, from the hour that I came in, did not stop tenderly kissing my feet.","You did not pour oil on my head, but this woman poured perfumed oil on my feet.","Because of this, I tell you, her sins, many  though they are, are forgiven, because she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little.”","Then he said to her: “Your sins are forgiven.”","Those reclining at the table with him started to say among themselves: “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”","But he said to the woman: “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”"],["Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him,","as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magʹda·lene, from whom seven demons had come out;","Jo·anʹna the wife of Chuʹza, Herod’s man in charge; Su·sanʹna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.","Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city, he spoke by means of an illustration:","“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on, and the birds of heaven ate them up.","Some landed on the rock, and after sprouting, they dried up because they had no moisture.","Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them.","But others fell on the good soil, and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.” As he said these things, he called out: “Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”","But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant.","He said: “To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations so that, though looking, they may look in vain, and though hearing, they may not get the sense.","Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God.","Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard, and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.","Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy, but these have no root. They believe for a while, but in a season of testing, they fall away.","As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but by being carried  away by anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity.","As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.","“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.","For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open.","Therefore, pay attention to how you listen, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”","Now his mother and brothers came to him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd.","So it was reported to him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”","In reply he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”","One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail.","But as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. And a violent windstorm descended on the lake, and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger.","So they went and woke him up, saying: “Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!” With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in.","Then he said to them: “Where is your faith?” But they were filled with fear and were astounded, saying to one another: “Who really is this? For he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”","And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerʹa·senes, which is on the side opposite Galʹi·lee.","As Jesus got out onto land, a demon-possessed man from the city met him. For a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not in a house, but among the tombs.","At the sight of Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, he said: “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”","(For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized him on many occasions,  and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places.)","Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said: “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.","And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss.","Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain, so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine, and he gave them permission.","With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice  into the lake and drowned.","But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.","Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they grew fearful.","Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well.","Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerʹa·senes asked Jesus to go away from them, because they were gripped by great fear. Then he went aboard the boat to depart.","However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him, but he sent the man away, saying:","“Go back home, and keep on relating what God did for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.","When Jesus returned, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him.","But look! a man named Jaʹi·rus came; this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house,","because his only  daughter, who was about 12 years old, was dying.","Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years, and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone.","She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and immediately her flow of blood stopped.","So Jesus said: “Who touched me?” When they were all denying it, Peter said: “Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.”","But Jesus said: “Someone touched me, for I know that power went out of me.”","Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately.","But he said to her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”","While he was yet speaking, a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: “Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher any longer.”","On hearing this, Jesus answered him: “Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.”","When he reached the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother.","But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: “Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.”","At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died.","But he took her by the hand and called to her: “Child, get up!”","And her spirit  returned, and she rose immediately, and he ordered that something be given her to eat.","Well, her parents were beside themselves, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened."],["Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.","And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal,","and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money;  neither have  two garments.","But wherever you enter into a home, stay there and leave from there.","And wherever people do not receive you, on going out of that city, shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.”","Then starting out, they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.","Now Herod  the district ruler  heard about everything that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead,","but others were saying that E·liʹjah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.","Herod said: “John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?” So he was trying to see him.","When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Beth·saʹi·da.","But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure.","Then the day was coming to a close. The Twelve now came up and said to him: “Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions, because out here we are in an isolated place.”","But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.”","There were, in fact, about 5,000 men. But he said to his disciples: “Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each.”","And they did so and had them all sit down.","Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.","So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftovers, 12 baskets of fragments.","Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came to him, and he questioned them, saying: “Who are the crowds saying that I am?”","In reply they said: “John the Baptist, but others say E·liʹjah, and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”","Then he said to them: “You, though, who do you say I am?” Peter answered: “The Christ of God.”","Then in a stern talk to them, he instructed them not to tell this to anybody,","but he said: “The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.”","Then he went on to say to all: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake  day after day and keep following me.","For whoever wants to save his life  will lose it, but whoever loses his life  for my sake is the one who will save it.","Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin?","For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will  be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels.","But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God.”","In fact, about eight days after saying these words, he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray.","And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white.","And look! two men were conversing with him; they were Moses and E·liʹjah.","These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem.","Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.","And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Instructor, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.” He did not realize what he was saying.","But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became afraid.","Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my Son, the one who has been chosen. Listen to him.”","As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.","The following day when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.","And look! a man called out from the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only one.","And look! a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him.","I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.”","In response Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you and put up with you? Bring your son over here.”","But even as he was approaching, the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.","And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God.","“Listen carefully and remember these words, for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands.”","But they did not understand what he was saying. In fact, it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.","Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest.","Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, stood him beside him,","and said to them: “Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me. For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great.”","In response John said: “Instructor, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.”","But Jesus said to him:  “Do not try to prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”","As the days were drawing near  for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.","So he sent messengers ahead of him. And they went and entered a village of Sa·marʹi·tans to make preparations for him.","But they did not receive him, because he was determined  to go to Jerusalem.","When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?”","But he turned and rebuked them.","So they went to a different village.","Now as they were going along the road, someone said to him: “I will follow you wherever you go.”","But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”","Then he said to another: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”","But he said to him: “Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God.”","And still another said: “I will follow you, Lord, but first permit me to say good-bye to those in my household.”","Jesus said to him: “No man who has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well-suited for the Kingdom of God.”"],["After these things the Lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go.","Then he said to them: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.","Go! Look! I am sending you out as lambs in among wolves.","Do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals, and do not greet anyone  along the road.","Wherever you enter into a house, say first: ‘May this house have peace.’","And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will return to you.","So stay in that house, eating and drinking the things they provide, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not keep transferring from house to house.","“Also, wherever you enter into a city and they receive you, eat what is set before you","and cure the sick ones in it and tell them: ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’","But wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you, go out into its main streets and say:","‘We wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city. Nevertheless, know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near.’","I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodʹom in that day than for that city.","“Woe to you, Cho·raʹzin! Woe to you, Beth·saʹi·da! because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Siʹdon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","Consequently, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Siʹdon in the judgment than for you.","And you, Ca·perʹna·um, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave  you will come!","“Whoever listens to you listens to me. And whoever disregards you disregards me also. Moreover, whoever disregards me disregards also Him who sent me.”","Then the 70 returned with joy, saying: “Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.”","At that he said to them: “I see Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven.","Look! I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing at all will harm you.","Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens.”","In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: “I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children. Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved.","All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”","With that he turned to the disciples and told them privately: “Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing.","For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.”","Now look! a man versed in the Law stood up to test him and said: “Teacher, what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?”","He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?”","In answer he said: “‘You must love Jehovah  your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul  and with your whole strength and with your whole mind’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’”","He said to him: “You answered correctly; keep doing this and you will get life.”","But wanting to prove himself righteous, the man said to Jesus: “Who really is my neighbor?”","In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jerʹi·cho and fell victim to robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went off, leaving him half-dead.","Now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.","Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.","But a certain Sa·marʹi·tan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.","So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","The next day he took out two de·narʹi·i,  gave them to the innkeeper, and said: ‘Take care of him, and whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I return.’","Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers?”","He said: “The one who acted mercifully toward him.” Jesus then said to him: “Go and do the same yourself.”","Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain  village. Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house.","She also had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.","Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties. So she came to him and said: “Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things? Tell her to come and help me.”","In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things.","A few things, though, are needed, or just one. For her part, Mary chose the good portion,  and it will not be taken away from her.”"],["Now he was in a certain place praying, and when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”","So he said to them: “Whenever you pray, say: ‘Father, let your name be sanctified.  Let your Kingdom come.","Give us each day our bread according to our daily needs.","And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.’”","Then he said to them: “Suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,","because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to offer him.’","But that one replies from inside: ‘Stop bothering me. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’","I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.","So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.","For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.","Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish?","Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion?","Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”","Later he expelled a speechless demon. After the demon came out, the speechless man spoke, and the crowds were amazed.","But some of them said: “He expels the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub,  the ruler of the demons.”","And others, to test him, began demanding a sign out of heaven from him.","Knowing their thinking, he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and a house divided against itself falls.","In the same way, if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub.","If I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges.","But if it is by means of God’s finger that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken  you.","When a strong, well-armed man guards his palace, his belongings remain secure.","But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him, that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting, and he divides up the things he took from him.","Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.","“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in search of a resting-place, and after finding none, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I moved.’","And on arriving, it finds the house swept clean and adorned.","Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there. So the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first.”","Now as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him: “Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you!”","But he said: “No, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”","When the crowds were massing together, he began to say: “This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Joʹnah.","For just as Joʹnah became a sign to the Ninʹe·vites, so will the Son of man be to this generation.","The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solʹo·mon. But look! something more than Solʹo·mon is here.","The men of Ninʹe·veh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Joʹnah preached. But look! something more than Joʹnah is here.","After lighting a lamp, a person puts it, not in a hidden place nor under a basket,  but on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.","The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is focused,  your whole body is also bright;  but when it is envious,  your body is also dark.","Be alert, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness.","Therefore, if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark, it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays.”","When he had said this, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.","However, the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash  before the dinner.","But the Lord said to him: “Now you Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness.","Unreasonable ones! The one who made the outside made also the inside, did he not?","But give as gifts of mercy  the things that are from within, and look! everything about you will be clean.","But woe to you Pharisees, because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb,  but you disregard the justice and the love of God! These things you were under obligation to do, but not to disregard those other things.","Woe to you Pharisees, because  you love the front  seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces!","Woe to you, because you are as those graves  that are not clearly visible,  that men walk on and do not know it!”","In reply one of those versed in the Law said to him: “Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us also.”","Then he said: “Woe also to you who are versed in the Law, because you load men down with loads hard to carry, but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers!","“Woe to you, because you build the tombs  of the prophets, but your forefathers killed them!","Certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers, and yet you approve of them, for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs.","That is why the wisdom of God also said: ‘I will send prophets and apostles to them, and they will kill and persecute some of them,","so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against  this generation,","from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zech·a·riʹah, who was killed between the altar and the house.’  Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against  this generation.","“Woe to you who are versed in the Law, because you took away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not go in, and you hinder those going in!”","So when he went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions,","lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say."],["In the meantime, when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, he started by saying first to his disciples: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.","But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known.","Therefore, whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops.","Moreover, I say to you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more.","But I will show you whom to fear: Fear the One who after killing has authority to throw into Ge·henʹna.  Yes, I tell you, fear this One.","Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value,  do they not? Yet not one of them is forgotten  by God.","But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.","“I say to you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.","But whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.","And everyone who says a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven.","When they bring you in before public assemblies,  government officials,  and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say,","for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say.”","Then someone in the crowd said to him: “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”","He said to him: “Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?”","Then he said to them: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed,  because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.”","With that he told them an illustration, saying: “The land of a rich man produced well.","So he began reasoning within himself, ‘What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?’","Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my goods,","and I will say to myself:  “You  have many good things stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’","But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life  from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’","So it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”","Then he said to his disciples: “That is why I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives  as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear.","For the life  is worth more than food and the body more than clothing.","Consider the ravens: They neither sow seed nor reap; they have neither barn nor storehouse; yet God feeds them. Are you not worth much more than birds?","Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit  to his life span?","If, therefore, you cannot do such a small thing, why be anxious about the remaining things?","Consider how the lilies grow: They neither toil nor spin; but I tell you that not even Solʹo·mon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.","Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, you with little faith!","So stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink, and stop being in anxious suspense;","for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but your Father knows you need these things.","Instead, keep seeking his Kingdom, and these things will be added to you.","“Have no fear, little flock, for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom.","Sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy.  Make money pouches that do not wear out, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief gets near and no moth consumes.","For where your treasure is, there your hearts will be also.","“Be dressed and ready  and have your lamps burning,","and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage, so when he comes and knocks, they may at once open to him.","Happy are those  slaves whom the master on coming finds watching! Truly I say to you, he will dress  himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them.","And if he comes in the second watch,  even if in the third,  and finds them ready, happy are they!","But know this, if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would not have let his house be broken into.","You also, keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think likely, the Son of man is coming.”","Then Peter said: “Lord, are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone?”","And the Lord said: “Who really is the faithful steward,  the discreet one,  whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants  to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time?","Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so!","I tell you truthfully, he will appoint him over all his belongings.","But if ever that slave should say in his heart, ‘My master delays coming,’ and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk,","the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know, and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones.","Then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked  will be beaten with many strokes.","But the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few. Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him, and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him.","“I came to start a fire on the earth, and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit?","Indeed, I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how I am distressed until it is finished!","Do you think I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.","For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three.","They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”","Then he also said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, at once you say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and it happens.","And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.","Hypocrites, you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to examine this particular time?","Why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous?","For example, when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler, while on the way, get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison.","I tell you,  you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin.”"],["At that time some who were present reported to him about the Gal·i·leʹans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.","In reply he said to them: “Do you think that those Gal·i·leʹans were worse sinners than all other Gal·i·leʹans because they have suffered these things?","No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise be destroyed.","Or those 18 on whom the tower in Si·loʹam fell, killing them—do you think that they had greater guilt than all other men who live in Jerusalem?","No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all be destroyed, as they were.”","Then he went on to tell this illustration: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none.","Then he said to the vinedresser, ‘Here it is three years that I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, but have found none. Cut it down! Why should it keep the ground useless?’","In reply he said to him, ‘Master, leave it alone for one more year until I dig around it and put on manure.","If it produces fruit in the future, well and good; but if not, then cut it down.’”","Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.","And look! a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness  for 18 years; and she was bent double and was unable to straighten up at all.","When he saw her, Jesus addressed her and said: “Woman, you are released from your weakness.”","And he laid his hands on her, and instantly she straightened up and began to glorify God.","But in response the presiding officer of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus did the cure on the Sabbath, said to the crowd: “There are six days on which work ought to be done; so come and be cured on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.”","However, the Lord answered him: “Hypocrites, does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his bull or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it something to drink?","Should not this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham and whom Satan held bound for 18 years, be released from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”","Well, when he said these things, all his opposers began to feel shame, but the entire crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things he did.","So he went on to say: “What is the Kingdom of God like, and with what can I compare it?","It is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of heaven nested in its branches.”","And again he said: “With what can I compare the Kingdom of God?","It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures  of flour until the whole mass was fermented.”","And he traveled from city to city and from village to village, teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem.","Now a man said to him: “Lord, are those being saved few?” He said to them:","“Exert yourselves vigorously to get  in through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to get in but will not be able.","When the householder gets up and locks the door, you will stand outside knocking at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us.’ But in answer he will say to you: ‘I do not know where you are from.’","Then you will start saying, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our main streets.’","But he will say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, all you workers of unrighteousness!’","There is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown outside.","Furthermore, people will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the Kingdom of God.","And look! there are those last who will be first, and there are those first who will be last.”","In that very hour some of the Pharisees came up and told him: “Get out and go away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.”","And he said to them: “Go and tell that fox, ‘Look! I am casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will be finished.’","Nevertheless, I must go on today, tomorrow, and the following day, because it cannot be  that a prophet should be put to death outside of Jerusalem.","Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to her—how often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings! But you did not want it.","Look! Your house is abandoned to you. I tell you, you will by no means see me until you say: ‘Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s  name!’”"],["On another occasion he went to eat a meal in the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath, and they were closely watching him.","And look! a man who had dropsy  was in front of him.","So in response Jesus asked those versed in the Law and the Pharisees: “Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath or not?”","But they kept silent. With that he took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.","Then he said to them: “Who of you, if his son or bull falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?”","And they were not able to reply to this.","He then told the invited men an illustration when he noticed how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves. He said to them:","“When you are invited by someone to a marriage feast, do not recline in the most prominent place. Perhaps someone more distinguished than you may also have been invited.","Then the one who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Let this man have your place.’ Then you will proceed with shame to take the lowest place.","But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the man who invited you comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, go on up higher.’ Then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests.","For  everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”","Next he said also to the man who had invited him: “When you spread a dinner or an evening meal, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. Otherwise, they might also invite you in return, and it would become a repayment to you.","But when you spread a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;","and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.”","On hearing these things, one of the fellow guests said to him: “Happy is the one who dines  in the Kingdom of God.”","Jesus said to him: “A man was spreading a grand evening meal, and he invited many.","He sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones, ‘Come, because everything is now ready.’","But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field and need to go out and see it; I ask you, have me excused.’","And another said, ‘I bought five yoke  of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, have me excused.’","Still another said, ‘I just got married, and for this reason I cannot come.’","So the slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly to the main streets and the alleys of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’","In time the slave said, ‘Master, what you ordered has been done, and still there is room.’","So the master said to the slave, ‘Go out to the roads and the lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.","For I say to you, none of those men who were invited will taste my evening meal.’”","Now large crowds were traveling with him, and he turned and said to them:","“If anyone comes to me and does not hate  his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life,  he cannot be my disciple.","Whoever does not carry his torture stake  and come after me cannot be my disciple.","For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?","Otherwise, he might lay its foundation but not be able to finish it, and all the onlookers would start to ridicule him,","saying: ‘This man started to build but was not able to finish.’","Or what king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10,000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000?","If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away, he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.","In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you who does not say good-bye to  all his belongings can be my disciple.","“Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if the salt loses its strength, with what will it be seasoned?","It is not suitable for soil or for manure. People throw it  away. Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.”"],["Now all the tax collectors and the sinners kept gathering around him to hear him.","And both the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”","Then he told them this illustration, saying:","“What man among you with 100 sheep, on losing one of them, will not leave the 99 behind in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?","And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices.","And when he gets home, he calls his friends and his neighbors together, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’","I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance.","“Or what woman who has ten drachma coins,  if she loses one of the drachmas,  does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it?","And when she has found it, she calls her friends  and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma coin  that I had lost.’","In the same way, I tell you, joy arises among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”","Then he said: “A man had two sons.","And the younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property that should come to me.’ So he divided his belongings between them.","A few days later, the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched  life.","When he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he fell into need.","He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to herd swine.","And he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating, but no one would give him anything.","“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more than enough bread, while I am dying here from hunger!","I will get up and travel to my father and say to him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.","I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.”’","So he got up and went to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him  and tenderly kissed him.","Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy of being called your son.’","But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe him with it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.","Also bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate,","for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they started to enjoy themselves.","“Now his older son was in the field, and as he returned and got near the house, he heard  music and dancing.","So he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening.","He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health.’","But he became angry and refused to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him.","In reply he said to his father, ‘Look! These many years I have slaved for you and never once did I disobey your orders, and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends.","But as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered  your belongings with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.’","Then he said to him, ‘My son, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours.","But we just had to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead but has come to life; he was lost and has been found.’”"],["Then he also said to the disciples: “A rich man had a steward  who was accused of handling his goods wastefully.","So he called him and said, ‘What is this I hear about you? Hand in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer manage the house.’","Then the steward said to himself, ‘What am I to do, seeing that my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.","Ah! I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, people will welcome me into their homes.’","And calling to him each one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’","He replied, ‘A hundred measures  of olive oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take back your written agreement and sit down and quickly write 50.’","Next, he said to another one, ‘Now you, how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred large measures  of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take back your written agreement and write 80.’","And his master commended the steward, though unrighteous, because he acted with practical wisdom;  for the sons of this system of things  are wiser in a practical way toward their own generation than the sons of the light are.","“Also, I say to you: Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.","The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.","Therefore, if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches, who will entrust you with what is true?","And if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what belongs to another, who will give you something for yourselves?","No servant can be a slave to two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves to God and to Riches.”","Now the Pharisees, who were money lovers, were listening to all these things, and they  began to sneer at him.","So he said to them: “You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is considered exalted by men is a disgusting thing in God’s sight.","“The Law and the Prophets were until John. From then on, the Kingdom of God is being declared as good news, and every sort of person is pressing forward toward it.","Indeed, it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to go unfulfilled.","“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","“There was a rich man who used to dress in purple and linen, enjoying himself day after day with magnificence.","But a beggar named Lazʹa·rus used to be put at his gate, covered with ulcers","and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man. Yes, even the dogs would come and lick his ulcers.","Now in the course of time, the beggar died and was carried off by the angels to Abraham’s side.","And in the Grave  he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and he saw Abraham from afar and Lazʹa·rus by his side.","So he called and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazʹa·rus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this blazing fire.’","But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you had your fill of good things in your lifetime, but Lazʹa·rus for his part received bad things. Now, however, he is being comforted here, but you are in anguish.","And besides all these things, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who want to go over from here to you cannot, neither may people cross over from there to us.’","Then he said, ‘That being so, I ask you, father, to send him to the house of my father,","for I have five brothers, in order that he may give them a thorough witness so that they will not also come into this place of torment.’","But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to these.’","Then he said, ‘No, indeed, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’","But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.’”"],["Then he said to his disciples: “It is unavoidable that causes for stumbling should come. Nevertheless, woe to the one through whom they come!","It would be more advantageous for him if a millstone were hung from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones.","Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother commits a sin, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.","Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”","Now the apostles said to the Lord: “Give us more faith.”","Then the Lord said: “If you had faith the size of a mustard grain, you would say to this black mulberry tree, ‘Be  uprooted and planted in the sea!’ and it would obey you.","“Which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come here at once and dine at the table’?","Rather, will he not say to him, ‘Get something ready for me to have my evening meal, and put on an apron and serve me until I finish eating and drinking, and afterward you can eat and drink’?","He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned, will he?","Likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’”","While he was going to Jerusalem, he was passing between Sa·marʹi·a and Galʹi·lee.","And as he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him, but they stood at a distance.","And they raised their voices and said: “Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!”","When he saw them, he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then as they were going off, they were cleansed.","One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.","And he fell facedown at Jesus’ feet, thanking him. Furthermore, he was a Sa·marʹi·tan.","In reply Jesus said: “All ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine?","Did no one else turn back to give glory to God except this man of another nation?”","Then he said to him: “Get up and be on your way; your faith has made you well.”","On being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, he answered them: “The Kingdom of God is not coming with striking observableness;","nor will people say, ‘See here!’ or, ‘There!’ For look! the Kingdom of God is in your midst.”","Then he said to the disciples: “Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it.","And people will say to you, ‘See there!’ or, ‘See here!’ Do not go out or chase after them.","For just as lightning flashes from one part of heaven to another part of heaven, so the Son of man will be in his day.","First, however, he must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by this generation.","Moreover, just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of man:","they were eating, they were drinking, men were marrying, women were being given in marriage until that day when Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood came and destroyed them all.","Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building.","But on the day that Lot went out of Sodʹom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all.","It will be the same on that day when the Son of man is revealed.","“On that day let the person who is on the housetop but whose belongings are in the house not come down to pick these up, and likewise, the person out in the field must not return to the things behind.","Remember the wife of Lot.","Whoever seeks to keep his life  safe will lose it, but whoever  loses it will preserve it alive.","I tell you, in that night two people will be in one bed; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned.","There will be two women grinding at the same mill; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned.”","——","So in response they said to him: “Where, Lord?” He said to them: “Where the body is, there also the eagles will be gathered together.”"],["Then he went on to tell them an illustration about the need for them always to pray and not to give up,","saying: “In a certain city there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man.","There was also a widow in that city who kept going to him and saying, ‘See that I get justice from my legal opponent.’","Well, for a while he was unwilling, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Although I do not fear God or respect any man,","because this widow keeps making me trouble, I will see that she gets justice so that she will not keep coming and wearing me out with her demand.’”","Then the Lord said: “Hear what the judge, although unrighteous, said!","Certainly, then, will not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, while he is patient toward them?","I tell you, he will cause justice to be done to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man arrives, will he really find this faith  on the earth?”","He also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness and who considered others as nothing:","“Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, ‘O God, I thank you that I am not like everyone else—extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.","I fast twice a week; I give the tenth of all things I acquire.’","But the tax collector, standing at a distance, was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward but kept beating his chest, saying, ‘O God, be gracious to me,  a sinner.’","I tell you, this man went down to his home and was proved more righteous than that Pharisee. Because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated, but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”","Now people were also bringing him their infants for him to touch them, but on seeing this, the disciples began to reprimand them.","However, Jesus called the infants to him, saying: “Let the young children come to me, and do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones.","Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.”","And one of the rulers questioned him, saying: “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit everlasting life?”","Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one, God.","You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.’”","Then he said: “All of these I have kept from youth on.”","After  hearing that, Jesus said to him, “There is still one thing lacking about you: Sell all the things you have and distribute the proceeds to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come be my follower.”","When he heard this, he became deeply grieved, for he was very rich.","Jesus looked at him and said: “How difficult it will be for those having money to make their way into the Kingdom of God!","It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”","Those who heard this said: “Who possibly can be saved?”","He said: “The things impossible with men are possible with God.”","But Peter said: “Look! We have left what was ours and followed you.”","He said to them: “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God","who will not get many times more in this period of time, and in the coming system of things,  everlasting life.”","Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them: “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by means of the prophets about the Son of man will be accomplished.","For instance, he will be handed over to men of the nations and will be mocked and treated insolently and spat on.","And after scourging him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.”","However, they did not get the meaning of any of these things, for these words were hidden from them, and they did not understand the things said.","Now as Jesus was getting near to Jerʹi·cho, a blind man was sitting beside the road begging.","Because he heard a crowd passing by, he began to inquire what was going on.","They reported to him: “Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ is passing by!”","At that he cried out: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”","And those who were in front began rebuking him, telling him to keep quiet, but all the more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”","Then Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him. After he came near, Jesus asked him:","“What do you want me to do for you?” He said: “Lord, let me recover my sight.”","So Jesus said to him: “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.”","And instantly he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him, glorifying God. Also, at seeing it, all the people gave praise to God."],["He then entered Jerʹi·cho and was passing through.","Now a man named Zac·chaeʹus was there; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.","Well, he was trying to see who this Jesus was, but he could not see because of the crowd, since he was short.","So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore  tree in order to see him, for he was about to pass that way.","Now when Jesus got to the place, he looked up and said to him: “Zac·chaeʹus, hurry and get down, for today I must stay in your house.”","With that he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest.","When they saw this, they were all muttering: “He went as a guest to the house of  a man who is a sinner.”","But Zac·chaeʹus stood up and said to the Lord: “Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted  from anyone, I am restoring four times over.”","At this Jesus said to him: “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.”","While they were listening to these things, he told another illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to appear instantly.","So he said: “A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return.","Calling ten of his slaves, he gave them ten miʹnas  and told them, ‘Do business with these until I come.’","But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to become king over us.’","“When he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power,  he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money,  in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity.","So the first one came forward and said, ‘Lord, your miʹna gained ten miʹnas.’","He said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.’","Now the second came, saying, ‘Your miʹna, Lord, made five miʹnas.’","He said to this one as well, ‘You too be in charge of five cities.’","But another one came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your miʹna that I kept hidden away in a cloth.","You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.’","He said to him, ‘By your own words I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?","So why did you not put my money  in a bank? Then on my coming, I would have collected it with interest.’","“With that he said to those standing by, ‘Take the miʹna from him and give it to the one who has the ten miʹnas.’","But they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten miʹnas!’—","‘I say to you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.","Moreover, bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me.’”","After he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.","And when he got near to Bethʹpha·ge and Bethʹa·ny at the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,","saying: “Go into the village that is within sight, and after you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.","But if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you must say, ‘The Lord needs it.’”","So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them.","But as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them:  “Why are you untying the colt?”","They said: “The Lord needs it.”","And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated Jesus on it.","As he moved along, they were spreading their outer garments on the road.","As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen,","saying: “Blessed is the one coming as the King in Jehovah’s  name! Peace in heaven, and glory in the heights above!”","However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”","But in reply he said: “I tell you, if these remained silent, the stones would cry out.”","And when he got nearby, he viewed the city and wept over it,","saying: “If you, even you, had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace—but now they have been hidden from your eyes.","Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege  you from every side.","They will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”","Then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling,","saying to them: “It is written, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers.”","He continued teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him;","but they did not find any way to do this, for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him."],["On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came","and said to him: “Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority?”","He replied to them: “I will also ask you a question, and you tell me:","Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”","Then they drew conclusions among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’","But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people one and all will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”","So they replied that they did not know its source.","Jesus said to them: “Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”","Then he began to tell the people this illustration: “A man planted a vineyard and leased it to cultivators, and he traveled abroad for a considerable time.","In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. The cultivators, however, sent him away empty-handed, after beating him.","But again he sent another slave. That one also they beat and humiliated  and sent away empty-handed.","Yet again he sent a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.","At  this the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my son, the beloved. They will likely respect this one.’","When the cultivators caught sight of him, they reasoned with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours.’","So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and kill these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.”","But he looked straight at them and said: “What, then, does this mean where it is written: ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone’?","Everyone falling on that stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.”","The scribes and the chief priests then sought to get their hands on him in that very hour, but they feared the people, for they realized that he told this illustration with them in mind.","And after observing him closely, they sent men whom they had secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous in order to catch him in his speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor.","And they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality, but you teach the way of God in line with truth:","Is it lawful  for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”","But he detected their cunning and said to them:","“Show me a de·narʹi·us.  Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said: “Caesar’s.”","He said to them: “By all means, then, pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar but God’s things to God.”","Well, they were not able to trap him in his speech before the people, but amazed at his answer, they became silent.","However, some of the Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him:","“Teacher, Moses wrote us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife, but he was childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’","Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife but died childless.","So the second","and the third married her. Likewise even all seven; they died and left no children.","Finally the woman also died.","Consequently, in the resurrection, whose wife will she become? For the seven had her as a wife.”","Jesus said to them: “The children of this system of things  marry and are given in marriage,","but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.","In fact, neither can they die anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection.","But that the dead are raised up, even Moses made known in the account about the thornbush, when he calls Jehovah  ‘the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.’","He is a God, not of the dead, but of the  living, for they are all living to him.”","In response some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well.”","For they no longer had the courage to ask him a single question.","In turn he asked them: “How is it they say that the Christ is David’s son?","For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘Jehovah  said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand","until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’","David, therefore, calls him Lord; so how is he his son?”","Then, while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples:","“Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and front  seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals,","and who devour the houses  of the widows and for show  make long prayers. These will receive a more severe  judgment.”"],["Now as he looked up, he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests.","Then he saw a needy widow drop in two small coins of very little value,","and he said: “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than they all did.","For all of these put in gifts out of their surplus, but she, out of her want,  put in all the means of living she had.”","Later, when some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with fine stones and dedicated things,","he said: “As for these things that you now see, the days will come when not a stone will be left upon a stone and not be thrown down.”","Then they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, when will these things actually be, and what will be the sign when these things are to occur?”","He said: “Look out that you are not misled, for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The due time is near.’ Do not go after them.","Furthermore, when you hear of wars and disturbances,  do not be terrified. For these things must take place first, but the end will not occur immediately.”","Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.","There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.","“But before all these things happen, people will lay their hands on you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name.","It will result in your giving a witness.","Therefore, resolve in your hearts not to rehearse beforehand how to make your defense,","for I will give you words and wisdom that all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute.","Moreover, you will be handed over  even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death,","and you will be hated by all people because of my name.","But not even a hair of your heads will  perish.","By your endurance you will preserve your lives.","“However, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.","Then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing to the mountains, let those in the midst of her leave, and let those in the countryside not enter into her,","because these are days for meting out justice  in order that all the things written may be fulfilled.","Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days! For there will be great distress on the land and wrath against this people.","And they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations  until the appointed times of the nations  are fulfilled.","“Also, there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation.","People will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","But as these things start to occur, stand up straight and lift up your heads, because your deliverance is getting near.”","With that he told them an illustration: “Notice the fig tree and all the other trees.","When they are budding, you see it for yourselves and know that now the summer is near.","Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.","Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all things happen.","Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.","“But pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you","as a snare. For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.","Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the Son of man.”","So by day he would be teaching in the temple, but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the Mount of Olives.","And all the people would come to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple."],["Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was getting near.","And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him, because they were afraid of the people.","Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Is·carʹi·ot, who was numbered among the Twelve,","and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them.","They were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money.","So he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around.","The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be  offered;","so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.”","They said to him: “Where do you want us to get it ready?”","He said to them: “Look! When you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters.","And say to the landlord of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you: “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’","And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room. Get it ready there.”","So they left and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.","So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the apostles.","And he said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;","for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.”","And accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said: “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves,","for I tell you, from now on, I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.”","Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”","Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.","“But look! the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table.","For, indeed, the Son of man is going his way according to what has been determined; all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”","So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this.","However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.","But he said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors.","You, though, are not to be that way. But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the one taking the lead as the one ministering.","For which one is greater, the one dining  or the one serving?  Is it not the one dining?  But I am among you as the one serving.","“However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials;","and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom,","so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel.","“Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat.","But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”","Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.”","But he said: “I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.”","He also said to them: “When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and  sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” They said: “No!”","Then he said to them: “But now let the one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.","For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘He was counted with lawless ones.’ For this is being fulfilled concerning me.”","Then they said: “Lord, look! here are two swords.” He said to them: “It is enough.”","On leaving, he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.","On arriving at the place, he said to them: “Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation.”","And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray,","saying: “Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”","Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.","But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.","When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples, he found them slumbering, exhausted from grief.","He said to them: “Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep praying, so that you do not enter into temptation.”","While he was still speaking, look! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him.","But Jesus said to him: “Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?”","When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”","One of them even struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his right ear.","But in reply Jesus said: “That is enough.” And he touched the ear and healed him.","Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him: “Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?","While I was with you in the temple day after day, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.”","Then they arrested him and led him off, and they brought him into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.","When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.","But a servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light of the fire, looked closely at him and said: “This man was also with him.”","But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman.”","After a short time another person saw him and said: “You too are one of them.” But Peter said: “Man, I am not.”","And after about an hour had passed, another man began insisting strongly: “Certainly this man was also with him, for he is, in fact, a Gal·i·leʹan!”","But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.","At this the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord when he had said to him: “Before a rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”","And he went outside and wept bitterly.","Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock  him, hitting him;","and after covering his face, they kept asking: “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”","And they said many other blasphemous things against him.","And when it became day, the assembly of elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they led him into their Sanʹhe·drin hall and said:","“If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them: “Even if I told you, you would not believe it at all.","Moreover, if I questioned you, you would not answer.","However, from now on the Son of man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God.”","At this they all said: “Are you, therefore, the Son of God?” He said to them: “You yourselves are saying that I am.”","They said: “Why do we need further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it out of his own mouth.”"],["So the multitude got up, one and all, and led him to Pilate.","Then they began to accuse him, saying: “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ a king.”","Now Pilate asked him the question: “Are you the King of the Jews?” In answer he said: “You yourself are saying it.”","Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: “I find no crime in this man.”","But they insisted, saying: “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Ju·deʹa, starting from Galʹi·lee even to here.”","On hearing that, Pilate asked whether the man was a Gal·i·leʹan.","After ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him on to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.","When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly. For a considerable time he had been wanting to see Jesus because he had heard much about him, and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him.","So he began to question him at length, but he gave him no answer.","However, the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him.","Then Herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to Pilate.","Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that very day, for before that they had been at enmity with each other.","Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people","and said to them: “You brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt. Now look! I examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him.","In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and look! he has done nothing deserving of death.","I will therefore punish him and release him.”","——","But the whole crowd shouted out: “Do away with this man,  and release Bar·abʹbas to us!”","(This man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder.)","Again Pilate called out to them, because he wanted to release Jesus.","Then they began to yell, saying: “To the stake with him! To the stake with him!”","The third time he said to them: “Why? What  bad thing did this man do? I found in him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore punish him and release him.”","At this they became insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be executed,  and their voices prevailed.","So Pilate made the decision that their demand be met.","He released the man whom they were demanding, who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, but he surrendered Jesus to their will.","Now as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne, who was coming from the countryside, and they placed the torture stake  on him to carry it behind Jesus.","A large number of people were following him, including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him.","Jesus turned to the women and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me. Weep instead for yourselves and for your children;","for look! days are coming when people will say, ‘Happy are the barren women, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse!’","Then they will start saying to the mountains, ‘Fall over us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us over!’","If they do these things when the tree is moist, what will occur when it is withered?”","Two other men, criminals, were also being led off to be executed with him.","And when they got to the place called Skull, they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.","But Jesus was saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, they cast lots to distribute his garments.","And the people stood looking on. But the rulers were sneering and saying: “Others he saved; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”","Even the soldiers mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine","and saying: “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.”","There was also an inscription over him: “This is the King of the Jews.”","Then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him, saying: “You are the Christ, are you not? Save yourself and us too!”","In response the other rebuked him, saying: “Do you not fear God at all, now that you have received the same judgment?","And we rightly so, for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did; but this man did nothing wrong.”","Then he said: “Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.”","And he said to him: “Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.”","Well, by now it was about the sixth hour,  and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour,","because the sunlight failed; then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle.","And Jesus called out with a loud voice and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he expired.","Because of seeing what occurred, the army officer began to glorify God, saying: “Truly, this man was righteous.”","And when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw  the things that occurred, they returned home, beating their chests.","And all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance. Also, women who had accompanied him from Galʹi·lee were there and saw these things.","And look! there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, who was a good and righteous man.","(This man had not voted in support of their scheme and action.) He was from Ar·i·ma·theʹa, a city of the Ju·deʹans, and was waiting for the Kingdom of God.","This man went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.","And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen, and he laid it in a tomb  carved in the rock, where no man had yet lain.","Now it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.","But the women who had come with him from Galʹi·lee followed along and took a look at the tomb  and saw how his body was laid,","and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils. But, of course, they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment."],["But on the first day of the week, they came very early to the tomb,  bringing the spices they had prepared.","But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,","and when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.","While they were perplexed about this, look! two men in shining garments stood by them.","The women became frightened and kept their faces turned toward the ground, so the men said to them: “Why are you looking for the living one among the dead?","He is not here, but has been raised up. Recall how he spoke to you while he was yet in Galʹi·lee,","saying that the Son of man must be handed over to sinful men and be executed on the stake and on the third day rise.”","Then they remembered his words,","and they returned from the tomb  and reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest.","They were Mary Magʹda·lene, Jo·anʹna, and Mary the mother of James. Also, the rest of the women with them were telling these things to the apostles.","However, these sayings seemed like nonsense to them, and they would not believe the women.","But Peter got up and ran to the tomb,  and stooping forward, he saw only the linen cloths. So he went off, wondering to himself what had occurred.","But look! on that very day, two of them were traveling to a village named Em·maʹus, about seven miles  from Jerusalem,","and they were conversing with each other about all these things that had happened.","Now as they were conversing and discussing these things, Jesus himself approached and began walking with them,","but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.","He said to them: “What are these matters that you are debating between yourselves as you walk along?” And they stood still, looking sad.","In answer the one named Cleʹo·pas said to him: “Are you a stranger dwelling alone in Jerusalem and do not know  the  things that have occurred there during these days?”","He asked them: “What things?” They said to him: “The things concerning Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ, who proved to be a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people;","and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they nailed him to the stake.","But we were hoping that this man was the one who was going to deliver Israel. Yes, and besides all these things, this is the third day since these things occurred.","Moreover, some women from among us also astonished us, for they went early to the tomb","and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a supernatural sight of angels, who said he is alive.","Then some of those who were with us went off to the tomb,  and they found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.”","So he said to them: “O senseless ones and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken!","Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”","And starting with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.","Finally they got close to the village to which they were traveling, and he made as if to travel on farther.","But they urged him to remain, saying: “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over.” With that he went in to stay with them.","And as he was dining  with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and began handing it to them.","At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from them.","And they said to each other: “Were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up  the Scriptures to us?”","And they got up in that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the Eleven and those assembled together with them,","who said: “For a fact the Lord was raised up, and he appeared to Simon!”","Then they related the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the bread.","While they were speaking of these things, he himself stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have peace.”","But because they were terrified and frightened, they imagined that they were seeing a spirit.","So he said to them: “Why are you troubled, and why have doubts come up in your hearts?","See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that I have.”","And as he said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.","But while they were still not believing for sheer joy and amazement, he said to them: “Do you have something there to eat?”","So they handed him a piece of broiled fish,","and he took it and ate it before their eyes.","He then said to them: “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things written about me in the Law  of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms must be fulfilled.”","Then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures,","and he said to them, “This is what is written: that the Christ would suffer and rise from among the dead on the third day,","and on the basis of his name, repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nations—starting out from Jerusalem.","You are to be witnesses of these things.","And look! I am sending upon you what my Father promised. You, though, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”","Then he led them out as far as Bethʹa·ny, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.","As he was blessing them, he was parted from them and taken up to heaven.","And they did obeisance  to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.","And they were continually in the temple, praising God."]],"John":[["In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.","This one was in the beginning with God.","All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.","by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men.","And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.","There came a man who was sent as a representative of God; his name was John.","This man came as a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, so that people of all sorts might believe through him.","He was  not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.","The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.","He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him.","He came to his own home, but his own people did not accept him.","However, to all who did receive him, he gave authority to become God’s children, because they were exercising faith in his name.","And they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God.","So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of divine favor  and truth.","(John bore witness about him, yes, he cried out: “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.’”)","For we all received from his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.","Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.","No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is at the Father’s side  is the one who has explained Him.","This is the witness John gave when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: “Who are you?”","And he admitted it and did not deny it, saying: “I am not the Christ.”","And they asked him: “What, then? Are you E·liʹjah?” He replied: “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”","So they said to him: “Who are you? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”","He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make the way of Jehovah  straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”","Now those sent were from the Pharisees.","So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you are not the Christ or E·liʹjah or the Prophet?”","John answered them: “I baptize in water. One is standing among you whom you do not know,","the one coming behind me, the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”","These things took place in Bethʹa·ny across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.","The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!","This is the one about whom I said: ‘Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.’","Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to Israel.”","John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.","Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me: ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit.’","And I have seen it, and I have given witness that this one is the Son of God.”","Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,","and as he looked at Jesus walking, he said: “See, the Lamb of God!”","When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.","Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, he said to them: “What are you looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi (which means, when translated, “Teacher”), where are you staying?”","He said to them: “Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour.","Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus.","He first found his own brother Simon and said to him: “We have found the Mes·siʹah” (which means, when translated, “Christ”),","and he led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked at him, he said: “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Ceʹphas” (which is translated “Peter”).","The next day he wanted to leave for Galʹi·lee. Jesus then found Philip and said to him: “Be my follower.”","Now Philip was from Beth·saʹi·da, from the city of Andrew and Peter.","Philip found Na·thanʹa·el and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote: Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazʹa·reth.”","But Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “Can anything good come out of Nazʹa·reth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.”","Jesus saw Na·thanʹa·el coming toward him and said about him: “See, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”","Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”","Na·thanʹa·el responded: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.”","Jesus answered him: “Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see things greater than these.”","He then said to him: “Most truly I say to you men, you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.”"],["And on the third day a marriage feast took place in Caʹna of Galʹi·lee, and the mother of Jesus was there.","Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.","When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him: “They have no wine.”","But Jesus said to her: “Woman, why is that of concern to me and to you?  My hour has not yet come.”","His mother said to those serving: “Do whatever he tells you.”","Now there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures.","Jesus said to them: “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim.","Then he said to them: “Now draw some out and take it to the director of the feast.” So they took it.","When the director of the feast tasted the water that had now been turned into wine, not knowing where it came from (although the servants who had drawn out the water knew), the director of the feast called the bridegroom","and said to him: “Everyone  else puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have saved the fine wine until now.”","Jesus did this in Caʹna of Galʹi·lee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest, and his disciples put their faith in him.","After this he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to Ca·perʹna·um, but they did not stay there many days.","Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","He found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money brokers in their seats.","So after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.","And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of commerce!”","His disciples recalled that it is written: “The zeal for your house will consume me.”","Therefore, in response the Jews said to him: “What sign can you show us, since you are doing these things?”","Jesus replied to them: “Tear down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”","The Jews then said: “This temple was built in 46 years, and will you raise it up in three days?”","But he was talking about the temple of his body.","When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples recalled that he used to say this, and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had spoken.","However, when he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the Passover, many people put their faith in his name when they saw the signs that he was performing.","But Jesus would not entrust himself to them because he knew them all","and because he did not need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he knew what was in man."],["There was a man of the Pharisees named Nic·o·deʹmus, a ruler of the Jews.","This one came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.”","In response Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born again,  he cannot see the Kingdom of God.”","Nic·o·deʹmus said to him: “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?”","Jesus answered: “Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.","What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.","Do not be amazed because I told you: You people must be born again.","The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit.”","In answer Nic·o·deʹmus said to him: “How can these things be?”","Jesus replied: “Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?","Most truly I say to you, what we know we speak, and what we have seen  we bear witness to, but you do not receive the witness we give.","If I have told you earthly things and you still do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?","Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but the one who descended from heaven, the Son of man.","And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up,","so that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.","“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.","For God did not send his Son into the world for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him.","Whoever exercises faith in him is not to be judged. Whoever does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.","Now this is the basis for judgment: that the light has come into the world, but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked.","For whoever practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be reproved.","But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that his works may be made manifest as having been done in harmony with God.”","After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Ju·deʹan countryside, and there he spent some time with them and was baptizing.","But John too was baptizing in Aeʹnon near Saʹlim, because there was a great quantity of water there, and people kept coming and were being baptized;","for John had not yet been thrown into prison.","Now the disciples of John had a dispute with a Jew concerning purification.","So they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you bore witness, see, this one is baptizing, and all are going to him.”","In answer John said: “A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven.","You yourselves bear me witness that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of that one.’","Whoever has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. So my joy has been made complete.","That one must keep on increasing, but I must keep on decreasing.”","The one who comes from above is over all others. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth. The one who comes from heaven is over all others.","He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his witness.","Whoever has accepted his witness has put his seal to it  that God is true.","For the one whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for He does not give the spirit sparingly.","The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.","The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him."],["When the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—","although Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—","he left Ju·deʹa and departed again for Galʹi·lee.","But it was necessary for him to go through Sa·marʹi·a.","So he came to a city of Sa·marʹi·a called Syʹchar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.","In fact, Jacob’s well was there. Now Jesus, tired out as he was from the journey, was sitting at the well.  It was about the sixth hour.","A woman of Sa·marʹi·a came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”","(For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food.)","So the Sa·marʹi·tan woman said to him: “How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink even though I am a Sa·marʹi·tan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Sa·marʹi·tans.)","In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”","She said to him: “Sir, you do not even have a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, then, do you have this living water?","You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?”","In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again.","Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”","The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”","He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come to this place.”","The woman replied: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You are right in saying, ‘I do not have a husband.’","For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”","The woman said to him: “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.","Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”","Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.","You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation begins with the Jews.","Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.","God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.”","The woman said to him: “I know that Mes·siʹah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one comes, he will declare all things to us openly.”","Jesus said to her: “I am he, the one speaking to you.”","Just then his disciples arrived, and they were surprised because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or “Why are you talking to her?”","So the woman left her water  jar and went off into the city and told the people:","“Come and see a man who told me everything I did. Could this not perhaps be the Christ?”","They left the city and began coming to him.","Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him: “Rabbi, eat.”","But he said to them: “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”","So the disciples said to one another: “No one brought him anything to eat, did he?”","Jesus said to them: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.","Do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already","the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.","For in this respect the saying is true: One is the sower and another the reaper.","I sent you to reap what you did not labor on. Others have labored, and you have entered into the benefit of their labor.”","Many of the Sa·marʹi·tans from that city put faith in him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, saying: “He told me all the things I did.”","So when the Sa·marʹi·tans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.","As a result, many more believed because of what he said,","and they said to the woman: “We no longer believe just because of what you said; for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the savior of the world.”","After the two days, he left there for Galʹi·lee.","Jesus himself, however, bore witness that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.","So when he arrived in Galʹi·lee, the Gal·i·leʹans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too had gone to the festival.","Then he came again to Caʹna of Galʹi·lee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son was sick in Ca·perʹna·um.","When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.","But Jesus said to him: “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”","The royal official said to him: “Lord, come down before my young child dies.”","Jesus said to him: “Go your way; your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he left.","But while he was on his way down, his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive.","So he asked them at what hour he got better. They replied to him: “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”","The father then knew that it was in the very hour that Jesus had said to him: “Your son lives.” So he and his whole household believed.","This was the second sign Jesus performed when he came from Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee."],["After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Now in Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate is a pool called in Hebrew  Beth·zaʹtha,  with five colonnades.","Within these a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, and those with withered  limbs were lying  down.","——","But one man was there who had been sick for 38 years.","Seeing this man lying there and being aware that he had already been sick for a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want to get well?”","The sick man answered him: “Sir, I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am on my way, another steps down ahead of me.”","Jesus said to him: “Get up! Pick up your mat  and walk.”","And the man immediately got well, and he picked up his mat  and began to walk.","So the Jews began to say to the cured man: “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”","But he answered them: “The same one who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat  and walk.’”","They asked him: “Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?”","But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.","After this Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, you have become well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse does not happen to you.”","The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.","For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during the Sabbath.","But he answered them: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.”","This is why the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.","Therefore, in response Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, the Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son does also in like manner.","For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, so that you may marvel.","For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes alive whomever he wants to.","For the Father judges no one at all, but he has entrusted all the judging to the Son,","so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.","Most truly I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes the One who sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.","“Most truly I say to you, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have paid attention will live.","For just as the Father has life in himself,  so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.","And he has given him authority to do judging, because he is the Son of man.","Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice","and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.","I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative.  Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.","“If I alone bear witness about myself, my witness is not true.","There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the witness he bears about me is true.","You have sent men to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.","However, I do not accept the witness from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.","That man was a burning and shining lamp, and for a short time you were willing to rejoice greatly in his light.","But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, these works that I am doing, bear witness that the Father sent me.","And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form,","and you do not have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the very one whom he sent.","“You are searching the Scriptures because you think that you will have everlasting life by means of them; and these are the very ones  that bear witness about me.","And yet you do not want to come to me so that you may have life.","I do not accept glory from men,","but I well know that you do not have the love of God in you.","I have come in the name of my Father, but you do not receive me. If someone else came in his own name, you would receive that one.","How can you believe, when you are accepting glory from one another and you are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?","Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you have put your hope.","In fact, if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.","But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe what I say?”"],["After this Jesus set out across the Sea of Galʹi·lee, or Ti·beʹri·as.","And a large crowd kept following him, because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick.","So Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.","Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.","When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy bread for these people to eat?”","However, he was saying this to test him, for he knew what he was about to do.","Philip answered him: “Two hundred de·narʹi·i  worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little.”","One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him:","“Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many?”","Jesus said: “Have the people sit down.” As there was a lot of grass in that place, the men sat down there, about 5,000 in number.","Jesus took the bread, and after giving thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting there; he did likewise with the small fish, and they had as much as they wanted.","But when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples: “Gather together the fragments left over, so that nothing is wasted.”","So they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.","When the people saw the sign he performed, they began to say: “This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world.”","Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone.","When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,","and boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Ca·perʹna·um. By now it had grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.","Also, the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing.","However, when they had rowed about three or four miles,  they saw Jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat, and they became fearful.","But he said to them: “It is I; do not be afraid!”","Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading.","The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there. A small one had been there, but Jesus had not boarded that boat with his disciples, for his disciples had left by themselves.","Boats from Ti·beʹri·as, however, arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.","So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they boarded their boats and came to Ca·perʹna·um to look for Jesus.","When they found him across the sea, they said to him: “Rabbi, when did you get here?”","Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.","Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for on this one the Father, God himself, has put his seal of approval.”","So they said to him: “What must we do to carry out the works of God?”","In answer Jesus said to them: “This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent.”","Then they said to him: “What are you performing as a sign, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you doing?","Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”","Jesus then said to them: “Most truly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.","For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”","So they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread.”","Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all, and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all.","But as I said to you, you have even seen me and yet do not believe.","All those whom the Father gives me will come to me, and I will never drive away the one who comes to me;","for I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.","This is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none out of all those whom he  has given me, but that I should resurrect them on the last day.","For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.”","Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he had said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”","And they began saying: “Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”","In response Jesus said to them: “Stop murmuring among yourselves.","No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him, and I will resurrect him on the last day.","It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by Jehovah.’  Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned comes to me.","Not that any man has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; this one has seen the Father.","Most truly I say to you, whoever believes has everlasting life.","“I am the bread of life.","Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died.","This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.","I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and for a fact, the bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”","Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”","So Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.","Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day;","for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.","Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.","Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me.","This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”","He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue  in Ca·perʹna·um.","When they heard this, many of his disciples said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”","But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: “Does this stumble you?","What, therefore, if you should see the Son of man ascending to where he was before?","It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.","But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him.","He went on to say: “This is why I have said to you, no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”","Because of this, many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.","So Jesus said to the Twelve: “You do not want to go also, do you?”","Simon Peter answered him: “Lord,  whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life.","We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”","Jesus answered them: “I chose you twelve, did I not? Yet one of you is a slanderer.”","He was, in fact, speaking of Judas the son of Simon Is·carʹi·ot, for this one was going to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve."],["After this Jesus continued traveling  about in Galʹi·lee, for he did not want to do so in Ju·deʹa because the Jews were seeking to kill him.","However, the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles  was near.","So his brothers said to him: “Leave here and go into Ju·deʹa, so that your disciples may also see the works you are doing.","For no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.”","His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him.","So Jesus said to them: “My time has not yet arrived, but your time is always at hand.","The world has no reason to hate you, but it hates me, because I bear witness about it that its works are wicked.","You go up to the festival; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come.”","So after he told them these things, he remained in Galʹi·lee.","But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not openly but in secret.","So the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying: “Where is that man?”","And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds. Some would say: “He is a good man.” Others would say: “He is not. He misleads the crowd.”","Of course, no one would speak about him publicly because of fear of the Jews.","When the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.","And the Jews were astonished, saying: “How does this man have such a knowledge of the Scriptures  when he has not studied at the schools?”","Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him who sent me.","If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or I speak of my own originality.","Whoever speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him, this one is true and there is no unrighteousness in him.","Moses gave you the Law, did he not? But not one of you obeys the Law. Why are you seeking to kill me?”","The crowd answered: “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?”","In answer Jesus said to them: “One deed I performed, and you are all surprised.","For this reason Moses has given you circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but it is from the forefathers—and you circumcise a man on a sabbath.","If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken, are you violently angry at me because I made a man completely well on a sabbath?","Stop judging by the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”","Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say: “This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not?","And yet see! he is speaking in public, and they say nothing to him.  Have the rulers come to know for certain that this is the Christ?","On the contrary, we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one is to know where he is from.”","Then as he was teaching in the temple, Jesus called out: “You know me and you know where I am from. And I have not come of my own initiative, but the One who sent me is real, and you do not know him.","I know him, because I am a representative from him, and that One sent me.”","So they began seeking to get hold of him, but no one laid a hand on him, for his hour had not yet come.","Still, many of the crowd put faith in him, and they were saying: “When the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”","The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize  him.","Jesus then said: “I will be with you a little while longer before I go to the One who sent me.","You will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.”","Therefore, the Jews said among themselves: “Where does this man intend to go, so that we will not find him? He does not intend to go to the Jews dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he?","What does he mean when he says, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come’?”","On the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up and he called out: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.","Whoever puts faith in me, just as the scripture has said: ‘From deep within him streams of living water will flow.’”","However, he said this concerning the spirit, which those who put faith in him were about to receive; for as yet there was no spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.","Some in the crowd who heard these words began saying: “This really is the Prophet.”","Others were saying: “This is the Christ.” But some were saying: “The Christ is not coming out of Galʹi·lee, is he?","Does the scripture not say that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David and from Bethʹle·hem, the village where David was?”","So a division over him arose among the crowd.","Some of them, though, wanted to seize  him, but no one laid his hands on him.","Then the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and the latter said to them: “Why did you not bring him in?”","The officers replied: “Never has any man spoken like this.”","In turn the Pharisees answered: “You have not been misled also, have you?","Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he?","But this crowd who do not know the Law are accursed people.”","Nic·o·deʹmus, who had come to him previously and who was one of them, said to them:","“Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing, does it?”","In answer they said to him: “You are not also out of Galʹi·lee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galʹi·lee.”"],[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"12  Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying: “I am the light of the world. Whoever  follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.”","So the Pharisees said to him: “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.”","In answer Jesus said to them: “Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from and where I am going.","You judge according to the flesh;  I do not judge any man at all.","And yet even if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.","Also, in your own Law it is written: ‘The witness of two men is true.’","I am one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.”","Then they said to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither me nor my Father. If you did know me, you would know my Father also.”","He spoke these words in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one seized him, for his hour had not yet come.","So he said to them again: “I am going away, and you will look for me, and yet you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”","The Jews then began to say: “He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’”","He went on to say to them: “You are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.","That is why I said to you: You will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am the one, you will die in your sins.”","So they began to say to him: “Who are you?” Jesus replied to them: “Why am I even speaking to you at all?","I have many things to speak concerning you and to pass judgment on. As a matter of fact, the One who sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.”","They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father.","Jesus then said: “After you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me, I speak these things.","And the One who sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”","As he was saying these things, many put faith in him.","Then Jesus went on to say to the Jews who had believed him: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples,","and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”","They replied to him: “We are Abraham’s offspring and never have been slaves to anyone. How is it you say, ‘You will become free’?”","Jesus answered them: “Most truly I say to you, every doer of sin is a slave of sin.","Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever.","So if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.","I know that you are Abraham’s offspring. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you.","I speak the things I have seen while with my Father, but you do the things you have heard from your father.”","In answer they said to him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If you were Abraham’s children, you would be doing the works of Abraham.","But now  you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.","You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him: “We were not born from immorality;  we have one Father, God.”","Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I have not come of my own initiative, but that One sent me.","Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word.","You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer when he began,  and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.","Because I, on the other hand, tell you the truth, you do not believe me.","Who of you convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it that you do not believe me?","The one who is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why you do not listen, because you are not from God.”","In answer the Jews said to him: “Are we not right in saying, ‘You are a Sa·marʹi·tan and have a demon’?”","Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.","But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who is seeking and judging.","Most truly I say to you, if anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.”","The Jews said to him: “Now we do know that you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say, ‘If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.’","You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?”","Jesus answered: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, the one who you say is your God.","Yet you have not known him, but I know him. And if I said I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word.","Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”","Then the Jews said to him: “You are not yet 50 years old, and still you have seen Abraham?”","Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, before Abraham came into existence, I have been.”","So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid and went out of the temple."],["As he was passing along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.","And his disciples asked him: “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?”","Jesus answered: “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it was so that the works of God might be made manifest in his case.","We must do the works of the One who sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no man can work.","As long as I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”","After he said these things, he spat on the ground and made a paste with the saliva, and he smeared the paste on the man’s eyes","and said to him: “Go wash in the pool of Si·loʹam” (which is translated “Sent Forth”). And he went and washed, and came back seeing.","Then the neighbors and those who formerly used to see  that he was a beggar began to say: “This is the man who used to sit and beg, is it not?”","Some were saying: “This is he.” Others were saying: “No, but he looks like him.” The man kept saying: “I am he.”","So they asked him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?”","He answered: “The man called Jesus made a paste and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Si·loʹam and wash.’ So I went and washed and gained sight.”","At this they said to him: “Where is that man?” He said: “I do not know.”","They led the formerly blind man to the Pharisees.","Incidentally, the day that Jesus made the paste and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.","So this time the Pharisees also began asking the man how he gained sight. He said to them: “He put a paste on my eyes, and I washed, and I can see.”","Some of the Pharisees then began to say: “This is not a man from God, for he does not observe the Sabbath.” Others said: “How can a man who is a sinner perform signs of that sort?” So there was a division among them.","And again they said to the blind man: “What do you say about him, since it was your eyes that he opened?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”","However, the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had gained sight, until they called the parents of the man who could now see.","And they asked them: “Is this your son who you say was born blind? How, then, does he now see?”","His parents answered: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.","But how it is that he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is of age. He must speak for himself.”","His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews, for the Jews had already come to an agreement that if anyone acknowledged him as Christ, that person should be expelled from the synagogue.","This is why his parents said: “He is of age. Question him.”","So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”","He answered: “Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know, that I was blind, but now I can see.”","Then they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”","He answered them: “I told you already, and yet you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?”","At this they scornfully told him: “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.","We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from.”","The man answered them: “This is certainly amazing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.","We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to this one.","From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.","If this man were not from God, he could do nothing at all.”","In answer they said to him: “You were altogether born in sin, and yet are you teaching us?” And they threw him out!","Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and on finding him, he said: “Are you putting faith in the Son of man?”","The man answered: “And who is he, sir, so that I may put faith in him?”","Jesus said to him: “You have seen him, and  in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”","He said: “I do put faith in him, Lord.” And he did obeisance  to him.","Jesus then said: “For this judgment I came into this world, that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”","Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “We are not blind also, are we?”","Jesus said to them: “If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, ‘We see.’ Your sin remains.”"],["“Most truly I say to you, the one who does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs in by another way, that one is a thief and a plunderer.","But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he has brought all his own out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.","They will by no means follow a stranger but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”","Jesus spoke this comparison to them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.","So Jesus said again: “Most truly I say to you, I am the door for the sheep.","All those who have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers; but the sheep have not listened to them.","I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and that one will go in and out and find pasturage.","The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance.","I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his life  in behalf of the sheep.","The hired man, who is not a shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them—","because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.","I am the fine shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me,","just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my life  in behalf of the sheep.","“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.","This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my life,  so that I may receive it again.","No man takes it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative. I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. This commandment I received from my Father.”","A division again resulted among the Jews because of these words.","Many of them were saying: “He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why do you listen to him?”","Others said: “These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people’s eyes, can it?”","At that time the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime,","and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solʹo·mon.","Then the Jews surrounded him and began to say to him: “How long are you going to keep us  in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”","Jesus answered them: “I told you, and  yet you do not believe. The works that I am doing in my Father’s name, these bear witness about me.","But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.","My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.","I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.","What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father.","I and the Father are one.”","Once again the Jews picked up stones to stone him.","Jesus replied to them: “I displayed to you many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?”","The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy; for you, although being a man, make yourself a god.”","Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said: “You are gods”’?","If he called ‘gods’ those against whom the word of God came—and yet the scripture cannot be nullified—","do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?","If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.","But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.”","So they tried again to seize him, but he escaped from their reach.","And he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.","And many people came to him and began saying: “John did not perform a single sign, but all the things John said about this man were true.”","And many put faith in him there."],["Now a man named Lazʹa·rus was sick; he was from Bethʹa·ny, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.","This was the Mary who poured perfumed oil on the Lord and wiped his feet dry with her hair; it was her brother Lazʹa·rus who was sick.","So his sisters sent a message to him, saying: “Lord, see! the one you have affection for is sick.”","But when Jesus heard it, he said: “This sickness is not meant to end in death, but is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”","Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazʹa·rus.","However, when he heard that Lazʹa·rus was sick, he actually remained in the place where he was for two more days.","Then after this he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Ju·deʹa again.”","The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, just lately the Ju·deʹans were seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”","Jesus answered: “There are 12 hours of daylight, are there not? If anyone walks in daylight, he does not stumble into anything, because he sees the light of this world.","But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”","After he said these things, he added: “Lazʹa·rus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him.”","The disciples then said to him: “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get well.”","Jesus, however, had spoken about his death. But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest  in sleep.","Then Jesus said to them plainly: “Lazʹa·rus has died,","and I rejoice for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”","So Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples: “Let us also go, so that we may die with him.”","When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazʹa·rus had already been in the tomb  for four days.","Now Bethʹa·ny was near Jerusalem, about two miles  away.","And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.","When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary kept sitting at home.","Martha then said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.","Yet even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.”","Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”","Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”","Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life;","and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?”","She said to him: “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.”","When she had said this, she went off and called Mary her sister, saying privately: “The Teacher is here and is calling you.”","On hearing this, she got up quickly and went to him.","Jesus had not yet come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha had met him.","When the Jews who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb  to weep there.","When Mary arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him, she fell at his feet and said to him: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”","When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he groaned within himself  and became troubled.","He said: “Where have you laid him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.”","Jesus gave way to tears.","At that the Jews began to say: “See, what affection he had for him!”","But some of them said: “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind man prevent this one from dying?”","Then Jesus, after groaning again within himself, came to the tomb.  It was, in fact, a cave, and a stone was lying against it.","Jesus said: “Take the stone away.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: “Lord, by now he must smell, for it has been four days.”","Jesus said to her: “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?”","So they took the stone away. Then Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.","True, I knew that you always hear me; but I spoke on account of the crowd standing around, so that they may believe that you sent me.”","When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: “Lazʹa·rus, come out!”","The man who had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his face was wrapped  with a cloth. Jesus said to them: “Free him and let him go.”","Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and who saw what he did put faith in him,","but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.","So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanʹhe·drin together and said: “What are we to do, for this man performs many signs?","If we let him go on this way, they will all put faith in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place  and our nation.”","But one of them, Caʹia·phas, who was high priest that year, said to them: “You do not know anything at all,","and you have not reasoned that it is to your benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”","He did not say this, however, of his own originality, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation,","and not only for the nation but also to gather together into one the children of God who were scattered about.","So from that day on they conspired to kill him.","Therefore, Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews, but he departed from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Eʹphra·im, and he stayed there with the disciples.","Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to cleanse themselves ceremonially.","They were looking for Jesus, and they were saying to one another as they stood around in the temple: “What is your opinion? That he will not come to the festival at all?”","But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where Jesus was, he should report it, so that they could seize  him."],["Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethʹa·ny, where Lazʹa·rus was, whom Jesus had raised up from the dead.","So they spread an evening meal for him there, and Martha was serving them, but Lazʹa·rus was one of those dining  with him.","Then Mary took a pound  of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very costly, and she poured it on the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair. The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil.","But Judas Is·carʹi·ot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said:","“Why was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 de·narʹi·i  and given to the poor?”","He said this, though, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to steal the money put in it.","Then Jesus said: “Let her alone, so that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial.","For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.”","Meanwhile, a large crowd of Jews got to know that he was there, and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazʹa·rus, whom he had raised up from the dead.","The chief priests now conspired to kill Lazʹa·rus also,","since it was because of him that many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus.","The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.","So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and they began to shout: “Save, we pray you! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s  name, the King of Israel!”","When Jesus found a young donkey, he sat on it, just as it is written:","“Have no fear, daughter of Zion. Look! Your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt.”","These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified, they recalled that these things were written about him and that they did these things to him.","Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazʹa·rus out of the tomb  and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness.","This is also why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard he had performed this sign.","So the Pharisees said among themselves: “You see that you are not getting anywhere. Look! The whole world has gone after him.”","Now there were some Greeks among those who had come to worship at the festival.","So these approached Philip, who was from Beth·saʹi·da of Galʹi·lee, and they began to request him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”","Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.","But Jesus answered them: “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.","Most truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just one grain; but if it dies, it then bears much fruit.","Whoever is fond of his life  destroys it, but whoever hates his life  in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.","If anyone would minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my minister will be also. If anyone would minister to me, the Father will honor him.","Now I am  troubled, and what should I say? Father, save me out of this hour. Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour.","Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came out of heaven: “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”","The crowd that was standing there heard it and began to say that it had thundered. Others said: “An angel has spoken to him.”","Jesus answered: “This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for your sakes.","Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.","And yet I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all sorts of men to myself.”","This he was really saying to indicate what sort of death he was about to die.","Then the crowd answered him: “We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?”","So Jesus said to them: “The light will be among you a little while longer. Walk while you still have the light, so that darkness does not overpower you; whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.","While you have the light, exercise faith in the light, so that you may become sons of light.”","Although he had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him,","so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, who  said: “Jehovah,  who has put faith in the thing heard from us?  And as for the arm of Jehovah,  to whom has it been revealed?”","The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said:","“He has blinded their eyes and has made their hearts hard, so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn around and I heal them.”","Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.","All the same, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him, but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue;","for they loved the glory of men even more than the glory of God.","However, Jesus called out and said: “Whoever puts faith in me puts faith not only in me but also in him who sent me;","and whoever sees me sees also the One who sent me.","I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.","But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world.","Whoever disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him. The word that I have spoken is what will judge him on the last day.","For I have not spoken of my own initiative, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak.","And I know that his commandment means everlasting life. So whatever I speak, I speak just as the Father has told me.”"],["Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.","The evening meal was going on, and the Devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Is·carʹi·ot, the son of Simon, to betray him.","So Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God,","got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist.","After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him.","Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?”","Jesus answered him: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”","Peter said to him: “You will certainly never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him: “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.”","Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, wash not only my feet but also my hands and my head.”","Jesus said to him: “Whoever has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is completely clean. And you men are clean, but not all of you.”","For he knew the man who was betraying him. This is why he said: “Not all of you are clean.”","When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on, he again reclined at the table and said to them: “Do you understand what I have done to you?","You address  me as ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are correct, for I am such.","Therefore, if I, the Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also should  wash the feet of one another.","For I set the pattern for you, that just as I did to you, you should also do.","Most truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.","If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.","I am not talking about all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this was so that the scripture might be fulfilled: ‘The one who was eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’","From this moment on, I am telling you before it occurs, so that when it does occur you may believe that I am he.","Most truly I say to you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me also, and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me.”","After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he bore witness, saying: “Most truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.”","The disciples began to look at one another, being at a loss as to which one he was talking about.","One of the disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining close to  Jesus.","Therefore, Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him: “Tell us whom he is talking about.”","So the latter leaned back on the chest of Jesus and said to him: “Lord, who is it?”","Jesus answered: “It is the one to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.” So after dipping the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Is·carʹi·ot.","After Judas took the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. So Jesus said to him: “What you are doing, do it more quickly.”","However, none of those reclining at the table knew why he said this to him.","Some, in fact, were thinking that since Judas was holding the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the festival,” or that he should give something to the poor.","So after he received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.","When, therefore, he had gone out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in connection with him.","God himself will glorify him, and he will glorify him immediately.","Little children, I am with you a little longer. You will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go you cannot come,’ I now say it also to you.","I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also love one another.","By this all will know that you are my disciples—if you have love among yourselves.”","Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered: “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.”","Peter said to him: “Lord, why is it I cannot follow you now? I will surrender my life  in your behalf.”","Jesus answered: “Will you surrender your life  in my behalf? Most truly I say to you, a rooster will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.”"],["“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Exercise faith in God; exercise faith also in me.","In the house of my Father are  many dwelling places.

How can we know the way?”","Jesus said to him: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.","If you men had known me, you would have known my Father also; from this moment on you know him and have seen him.”","Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”","Jesus said to him: “Even after I have been with you men for such a long time, Philip, have you not come to know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. How is it you say, ‘Show us the Father’?","Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me?

I am coming to you.","In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will see me, because I live and you will live.","In that day you will know that I am in union with my Father and you are in union with me and I am in union with you.","Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.”","Judas, not Is·carʹi·ot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world?”","In answer Jesus said to him: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling  with him.","Whoever does not love me does not observe my words.

They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have observed  your word.","Now they have come to know that all the things you gave me are from you;","because I have given them the sayings that you gave me, and they have accepted them and have certainly come to know that I came as your representative, and they have believed that you sent me.","I make request concerning them; I make request, not concerning the world, but concerning those whom you  have given me, because they are yours;","and all my things are yours and yours are mine, and I have been glorified among them.","“I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me, so that they may be one  just as we are one.","When I was with them, I used to watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me; and I have protected them, and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction, so that the scripture might be fulfilled.","But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world, so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves.","I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.","“I do not request that you take them out of the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.","They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.","Sanctify them  by means of the truth; your word is truth.","Just as you sent me into the world, I also sent them into the world.","And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf, so that they also may be sanctified by means of truth.","“I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word,","so that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.","I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one.","I in union with them and you in union with me, in order that they may be perfected into one,  so that the world may know that you sent me and that you loved them just as you loved me.","Father, I want those whom you have given me to be with me where I am, in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the founding of the world.","Righteous Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you, but I know you, and these have come to know that you sent me.","I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.”"],["After he said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidʹron Valley  to where there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.","Now Judas, his betrayer, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.","So Judas brought the detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons.","Then Jesus, knowing all the things that were going to happen to him, stepped forward and said to them: “Whom are you looking for?”","They answered him: “Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ.” He said to them: “I am he.” Now Judas, his betrayer, was also standing with them.","However, when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they drew  back and fell to the ground.","So he asked them again: “Whom are you looking for?” They said: “Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ.”","Jesus answered: “I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.”","This was to fulfill what he had said: “Of those whom you have given me, I have not lost a single one.”","Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The name of the slave was Malchus.","Jesus, however, said to Peter: “Put the sword into its sheath. Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”","Then the soldiers and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized  Jesus and bound him.","They led him first to Anʹnas, for he was the father-in-law of Caʹia·phas, who was high priest that year.","Caʹia·phas was, in fact, the one who had advised the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people.","Now Simon Peter, as well as another disciple, was following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,","but Peter was standing outside at the door.  So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.","The servant girl who was the doorkeeper then said to Peter: “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said: “I am not.”","Now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made, because it was cold and they were warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.","So the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.","Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret.","Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I told them. See! These know what I said.”","After he said these things, one of the officers who was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said: “Is that the way you answer the chief priest?”","Jesus answered him: “If I said something wrong, bear witness  about the wrong; but if what I said was right, why do you hit me?”","Then Anʹnas sent him away bound to Caʹia·phas the high priest.","Now Simon Peter was standing there warming himself. Then they said to him: “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said: “I am not.”","One of the slaves of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said: “I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?”","However, Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.","Then they led Jesus from Caʹia·phas to the governor’s residence. It was now early in the morning. But they themselves did not enter into the governor’s residence, so that they would not get defiled but could eat the Passover.","So Pilate came outside to them and said: “What  accusation do you bring against this man?”","They answered him: “If this man were not a wrongdoer,  we would not have handed him over to you.”","So Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him: “It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.”","This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate what sort of death he was about to die.","So Pilate entered the governor’s residence again and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the King of the Jews?”","Jesus answered: “Are you asking this of your own originality, or did others tell you about me?”","Pilate replied: “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What did you do?”","Jesus answered: “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my Kingdom is not from this source.”","So Pilate said to him: “Well, then, are you a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.”","Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”","Moreover, you have a custom that I should release a man to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”","Again they shouted: “Not this man, but Bar·abʹbas!” Now Bar·abʹbas was a robber."],["Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him.","And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and clothed him with a purple robe,","and they kept coming up to him and saying: “Greetings,  you King of the Jews!” They also kept slapping him in the face.","Pilate went outside again and said to them: “See! I bring him outside to you in order for you to know that I find no fault in him.”","So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: “Look! The man!”","However, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted: “To the stake with him! To the stake with him!”  Pilate said to them: “Take him yourselves and execute him,  for I do not find any fault in him.”","The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself God’s son.”","When Pilate heard what they were saying, he became even more fearful,","and he entered the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus: “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.","So Pilate said to him: “Are you refusing to speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and I have authority to execute you?”","Jesus answered him: “You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man who handed me over to you has greater sin.”","For this reason Pilate kept trying to find a way to release him, but the Jews shouted: “If  you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against  Caesar.”","Then Pilate, after hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called the Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew,  Gabʹba·tha .","Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.  And he said to the Jews: “See! Your king!”","However, they shouted: “Take him away! Take him away! To the stake with him!”  Pilate said to them: “Shall I execute your king?” The chief priests answered: “We have no king but Caesar.”","Then he handed him over to them to be executed on the stake.","Bearing the torture stake  for himself, he went out to the so-called Skull Place, which is called  Golʹgo·tha  in Hebrew.","There they nailed him to the stake alongside two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.","Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the torture stake.  It was written: “Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ the King of the Jews.”","Many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was nailed to the stake was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.","However, the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”","Pilate answered: “What I have written, I have written.”","Now when the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the stake, they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and they also took the inner garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from top to bottom.","So they said to one another: “Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be.” This was to fulfill the scripture: “They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.” So the soldiers actually did these things.","By the torture stake  of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and his mother’s sister; Mary the wife of Cloʹpas and Mary Magʹda·lene.","So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother: “Woman, see! Your son!”","Next he said to the disciple: “See! Your mother!” And from that hour on, the disciple took her into his own home.","After this, when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished, in order to fulfill the scripture he said: “I am thirsty.”","A jar was sitting there full of sour wine. So they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop  stalk and held it up to his mouth.","When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said: “It has been accomplished!” and bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.","Since it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the torture stakes on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great one), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away.","So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man who was on a stake alongside  him.","But on coming to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs.","But one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.","And the one who has seen it has given this witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that what he says is true, so that you also may believe.","In fact, these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.”","And again, a different scripture says: “They will look to the one whom they pierced.”","Now after these things, Joseph of Ar·i·ma·theʹa, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body away.","Nic·o·deʹmus, the man who had come to him in the night the first time, also came, bringing a mixture  of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.","So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.","Incidentally, there was a garden at the place where he was executed,  and in the garden was a new tomb  in which no one had ever yet been laid.","Because it was the day of Preparation of the Jews and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."],["On the first day of the week, Mary Magʹda·lene came to the tomb  early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had already been taken away from the tomb.","So she came running to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, for whom Jesus had affection, and she said to them: “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”","Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb.","The two of them began running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.","Stooping forward, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.","Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and he went into the tomb. And he saw the linen cloths lying there.","The cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself.","Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.","For they did not yet understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead.","So the disciples went back to their homes.","Mary, however, kept standing outside near the tomb, weeping. While she was weeping, she stooped forward to look into the tomb,","and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet.","And they said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them: “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have laid him.”","After saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.","Jesus said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She, thinking it was the gardener, said to him: “Sir,  if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”","Jesus said to her: “Mary!” On turning around, she said to him in Hebrew:  “Rab·boʹni!”  (which means “Teacher!”)","Jesus said to her: “Stop clinging to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.’”","Mary Magʹda·lene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what he had said to her.","When it was late that day, the first day of the week, and the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have peace.”","After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.","Jesus said to them again: “May you have peace. Just as the Father has sent me, I also am sending you.”","After saying this he blew on them and said to them: “Receive holy spirit.","If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you retain those of anyone, they are retained.”","But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.","So the other disciples were telling him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “Unless I see in his hands the print  of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will never believe it.”","Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst and said: “May you have peace.”","Next he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop doubting  but believe.”","In answer Thomas said to him: “My Lord and my God!”","Jesus said to him: “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.”","To be sure, Jesus also performed many other signs before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll.","But these have been written down so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and because of believing, you may have life by means of his name."],["After this Jesus manifested himself  again to the disciples, at the Sea of Ti·beʹri·as. He made the manifestation in this way.","There were together Simon Peter, Thomas (who was called the Twin), Na·thanʹa·el from Caʹna of Galʹi·lee, the sons of Zebʹe·dee, and two others of his disciples.","Simon Peter said to them: “I am going fishing.” They said to him: “We are coming with you.” They went out and got aboard the boat, but during that night they caught nothing.","However, just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.","Then Jesus said to them: “Children, you do not have anything  to eat, do you?” They answered: “No!”","He said to them: “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” So they cast it, but  they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish.","Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “It is the Lord!” Now Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Lord, put on  his outer garment, for he was naked,  and plunged into the sea.","But the other disciples came in the small boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not a long way from land, only about 300 feet  away.","When they came ashore, they saw there a charcoal fire with fish lying on it and bread.","Jesus said to them: “Bring some of the fish you just now caught.”","So Simon Peter went on board and hauled the net ashore full of big fish, 153 of them. And though there were so many, the net did not burst.","Jesus said to them: “Come, have your breakfast.” Not one of the disciples had the courage to ask him: “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord.","Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish.","This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after being raised up from the dead.","When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He replied to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Feed my lambs.”","Again he said to him a second time: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He replied: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” He said to him: “Shepherd my little sheep.”","He said to him a third time: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” Peter became grieved that he asked him the third time: “Do you have affection for me?” So he said to him: “Lord, you are aware of all things; you know that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him: “Feed my little sheep.","Most truly I say to you, when you were younger, you used to clothe yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and another man will clothe you and carry you where you do not wish.”","He said this to indicate by what sort of death he would glorify God. After he said this, he said to him: “Continue following me.”","Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back on his chest and said: “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”","So when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, what about this man?”","Jesus said to him: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.”","So the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but he said: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?”","This is the disciple who gives this witness about these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his witness is true.","There are also, in fact, many other things that Jesus did, which if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written."]],"Acts":[["The first account, O The·ophʹi·lus, I composed about all the things Jesus started to do and to teach","until the day that he was taken up, after he had given instructions through holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen.","After he had suffered, he showed himself alive to them by many convincing proofs. He was seen by them throughout 40 days, and he was speaking about the Kingdom of God.","While he was meeting with them, he ordered them: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised, about which you heard from me;","for John, indeed, baptized with water, but you will be baptized with holy spirit not many days after this.”","So when they had assembled, they asked him: “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”","He said to them: “It does not belong to you to know the times or seasons that the Father has placed  in his own jurisdiction.","But you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in all Ju·deʹa and Sa·marʹi·a, and to the most distant part  of the earth.”","After he had said these things, while they were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their sight.","And as they were gazing into the sky while he was on his way, suddenly two men in white garments stood beside them","and said: “Men of Galʹi·lee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will come in the same manner as you have seen him going into the sky.”","Then they returned to Jerusalem from a mountain called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, only a sabbath day’s journey away.","When they arrived, they went up into the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter as well as John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bar·tholʹo·mew and Matthew, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, and Simon the zealous one, and Judas the son of James.","With one purpose all of these were persisting in prayer, together with some women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.","During those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (the number  of people was altogether about 120) and said:","“Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the holy spirit spoke prophetically through David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.","For he had been numbered among us and he obtained a share in this ministry.","(This very man, therefore, purchased a field with the wages for unrighteousness, and falling headfirst, his body burst open  and all his insides spilled out.","This became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language  A·kelʹda·ma,  that is, “Field of Blood.”)","For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his dwelling become desolate, and let there be no inhabitant in it’ and, ‘His office of oversight let someone else take.’","It is therefore necessary that of the men who accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus carried on his activities  among us,","starting with his baptism by John until the day he was taken up from us, one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection.”","So they proposed two, Joseph called Barʹsab·bas, who was also called Justus, and Mat·thiʹas.","Then they prayed and said: “You, O Jehovah,  who know the hearts of all, designate which one of these two men you have chosen","to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas deviated to go to his own place.”","So they cast lots over them, and the lot fell to Mat·thiʹas, and he was counted  along with the 11 apostles."],["Now while the day of the Festival of Pentecost was in progress, they were all together at the same place.","Suddenly there was a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.","And tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed, and one came to rest on each one of them,","and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak in different languages,  just as the spirit enabled them to speak.","At that time devout Jews from every nation under heaven were staying in Jerusalem.","So when this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.","Indeed, they were utterly amazed and said: “See here, all these who are speaking are Gal·i·leʹans, are they not?","How is it, then, that each one of us is hearing his own native language?","Parʹthi·ans, Medes, and Eʹlam·ites, the inhabitants of Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a, Ju·deʹa and Cap·pa·doʹci·a, Ponʹtus and the province of Asia,","Phrygʹi·a and Pam·phylʹi·a, Egypt and the regions of Libʹy·a near Cy·reʹne, sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,","Creʹtans, and Arabians—we hear them speaking in our languages about the magnificent things of God.”","Yes, they were all astonished and perplexed, saying to one another: “What does this mean?”","However, others mocked them and said: “They are full of sweet wine.”","But Peter stood up with the Eleven and spoke to them in a loud voice: “Men of Ju·deʹa and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and listen carefully to my words.","These people are, in fact, not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.","On the contrary, this is what was said through the prophet Joel:","‘“And in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out some of my spirit on every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams,","and even on my male slaves and on my female slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.","And I will give wonders  in heaven above and signs on earth below—blood and fire and clouds of smoke.","The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and illustrious day of Jehovah  comes.","And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah  will be saved.”’","“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ was a man publicly shown to you by God through powerful works and wonders  and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know.","This man, who was handed over by the determined will  and foreknowledge of God, you fastened to a stake by the hand of lawless men, and you did away with him.","But God resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs  of death, because it was not possible for him to be held fast by it.","For David says about him: ‘I keep Jehovah  constantly in front of me,  for he is at my right hand that I may never be shaken.","On this account my heart became cheerful and my tongue rejoiced greatly. And I  will reside in hope;","because you will not  leave me  in the Grave,  nor will you allow your loyal one to see corruption.","You have made life’s ways known to me; you will fill me with great joy in your presence.’","“Men, brothers, it is permissible to speak with freeness of speech to you about the family head David, that he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.","Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one of his offspring  on his throne,","he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in the Grave  nor did his flesh see corruption.","God resurrected this Jesus, and of this we are all witnesses.","Therefore, because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you see and hear.","For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah  said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand","until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’","Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you executed on a stake.”","Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Men, brothers, what should we do?”","Peter said to them: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.","For the promise is to you and your children, and to all those who are far away, to all those whom Jehovah  our God may call to himself.”","And with many other words he gave a thorough witness and kept exhorting them, saying: “Get saved from this crooked generation.”","So those who gladly accepted his word were baptized, and on that day about 3,000 people  were added.","And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to associating together,  to the taking of meals, and to prayers.","Indeed, fear began to fall upon everyone,  and many wonders  and signs began to occur through the apostles.","All those who became believers were together and had everything in common,","and they were selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all, according to what each one needed.","And day after day they were in constant attendance in the temple with a united purpose, and they took their meals in different homes and shared their food with great rejoicing and sincerity of heart,","praising God and finding favor with all the people. At the same time Jehovah  continued to add to them daily those being saved."],["Now Peter and John were going up into the temple for the hour of prayer, the ninth hour,","and a man who was lame from birth was being carried. Every day they would put him near the temple door that was called Beautiful, so he could  ask for gifts of mercy from those entering the temple.","When he caught sight of Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking for gifts of mercy.","But Peter, together with John, looked straight at him and said: “Look at us.”","So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to get something from them.","However, Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have is what I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Naz·a·reneʹ, walk!”","With that he took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up. Instantly his feet and his ankles were made firm;","and leaping to his feet, he began walking and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.","And all the people saw him walking and praising God.","And they began to recognize him, that this was the man who used to sit waiting for gifts of mercy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were completely astonished and ecstatic about what had happened to him.","While the man was still holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at what was called Solʹo·mon’s Colonnade, completely surprised.","When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Men of Israel, why are you so amazed at this, and why are you staring at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk?","The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom you handed over and disowned before Pilate, even though he had decided to release him.","Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one, and you asked for a man who was a murderer to be given to you,","whereas you killed the Chief Agent of life. But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses.","And through his name, and by our faith in his name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong. The faith that is through him has made this man completely healthy in front of all of you.","And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers also did.","But in this way God has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer.","“Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself","and he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus.","Heaven must hold this one within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old.","In fact, Moses said: ‘Jehovah  your God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you.","Indeed, anyone  who does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.’","And all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed him, as many as have spoken, have also plainly declared these days.","You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your forefathers, saying to Abraham: ‘And by means of your offspring  all the families of the earth will be blessed.’","God, after raising up his Servant, sent him to  you first to bless you by turning each one of you away from your wicked deeds.”"],["While the two were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came up to them.","These were annoyed because the apostles were teaching the people and were openly declaring the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.","So they seized  them and took them into custody until the next day, for it was already evening.","However, many of those who had listened to the speech believed, and the number of the men became about 5,000.","The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,","along with Anʹnas the chief priest, Caʹia·phas, John, Alexander, and all who were relatives of the chief priest.","They stood Peter and John in their midst and began to question them: “By what power or in whose name did you do this?”","Then Peter, filled with holy spirit, said to them:","if we are being examined today about a good deed to a crippled man, and you want to know who made this man well,","let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Naz·a·reneʹ, whom you executed on a stake but whom God raised up from the dead, by means of him this man stands here healthy in front of you.","This is ‘the stone that was treated by you builders as of no account that has become the chief cornerstone.’","Furthermore, there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”","Now when they saw the outspokenness  of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated  and ordinary men, they were astonished. And they began to realize that they had been with Jesus.","As they were looking at the man who had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in answer to this.","So they commanded them to go outside the Sanʹhe·drin hall, and they began consulting with one another,","saying: “What should we do with these men? Because, for a fact, a noteworthy sign has occurred through them, one evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.","So that this does not spread any further among the people, let us threaten them and tell them not to speak to anyone anymore on the basis of this name.”","With that they called them and ordered them not to say anything at all or to teach on the basis of the name of Jesus.","But in reply Peter and John said to them: “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves.","But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.”","So after they had threatened them further, they released them, since they did not find any grounds for punishing them and on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God over what had happened.","For the man on  whom this miracle  of healing had been done was more than 40 years old.","After being released, they went to their own people and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.","On hearing this, they raised their voices with one accord to God and said:","and who said through holy spirit by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant: ‘Why did nations become agitated and peoples meditate on empty things?","The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers gathered together as one against Jehovah  and against his anointed one.’","For truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of the nations and with peoples of Israel were gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,","to do what your hand and counsel had determined beforehand to occur.","And now, Jehovah,  give attention to their threats, and grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness,","while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and wonders  occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”","And when they had made supplication,  the place where they were gathered together was shaken, and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.","Moreover, the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul,  and not even one of them would say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.","And with great power the apostles continued giving the witness about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and undeserved kindness was upon them all in large measure.","In fact, no one was in need among them, for all those who owned fields or houses would sell them and bring the value of what was sold,","and they would deposit it at the feet of the apostles. In turn distribution would be made to each one according to his need.","So Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barʹna·bas (which means, when translated, “Son of Comfort”), a Levite, a native of Cyʹprus,","owned a piece of land, and he sold it and brought the money and deposited it at the feet of the apostles."],["However, a man named An·a·niʹas, together with his wife Sap·phiʹra, sold some property.","But he secretly held back some of the price, with his wife’s knowledge, and he brought just a part of it and deposited it at the feet of the apostles.","But Peter said: “An·a·niʹas, why has Satan emboldened you to lie to the holy spirit and secretly hold back some of the price of the field?","As long as it remained with you, did it not remain yours? And after it was sold, was it not in your control? Why have you thought up such a deed as this in your heart? You have lied, not to men, but to God.”","On hearing these words, An·a·niʹas collapsed and died. And great fear came over all those who heard about it.","Then the younger men rose, wrapped him  in cloths, carried him out, and buried him.","Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.","Peter said to her: “Tell me, did you two sell the field for so much?” She said: “Yes, for that amount.”","So Peter said to her: “Why did you two agree to make a test of the spirit of Jehovah?  Look! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.”","Instantly she collapsed at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead and they carried her out and buried her alongside her husband.","So great fear came over the whole congregation and over all those hearing about these things.","Moreover, through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders  continued to occur among the people; and they would all meet together in Solʹo·mon’s Colonnade.","True, none of the others had the courage to join them; nevertheless, the people were speaking highly of them.","More than that, believers in the Lord kept on being added, great numbers both of men and of women.","They even brought the sick out into the main streets and laid them there on small beds and mats, so that as Peter would pass by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.","Also, crowds of people from the cities around Jerusalem kept coming, carrying sick people and those troubled with unclean spirits, and they were one and all cured.","But the high priest rose, and all those with him, who were of the sect of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy.","And they seized  the apostles and put them in the public jail.","But during the night, Jehovah’s  angel opened the doors of the prison, brought them out, and said:","“Go and take your stand in the temple, and keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.”","After hearing this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.","But when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and made their report,","saying: “We found the jail locked and secure, and the guards were standing at the doors, but on opening it up, we found no one inside.”","Well, when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about what would come of this.","But someone came and reported to them: “Look! The men you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.”","Then the captain went off with his officers and brought them in, but without violence, because they were afraid of being stoned by the people.","So they brought them and stood them before the Sanʹhe·drin. Then the high priest questioned them","and said: “We strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name, and yet look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you are determined to  bring the blood of this man upon us.”","In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.","The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a stake.","God exalted this one as Chief Agent and Savior to his right hand, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.","And we are witnesses of these matters, and so is the holy spirit, which God has given to those obeying him as ruler.”","When they heard this, they were infuriated  and wanted to do away with them.","But a Pharisee named Ga·maʹli·el rose in the Sanʹhe·drin; he was a Law teacher esteemed by all the people, and he gave the command to put the men outside for a little while.","Then he said to them: “Men of Israel, be careful as to what you intend to do about these men.","For instance, before these days Theuʹdas rose up, saying he himself was somebody, and a number of men, about 400, joined his party. But he was done away with, and all those who were following him were dispersed and came to nothing.","After him, Judas the Gal·i·leʹan rose up in the days of the registration, and he drew followers after himself. That man also perished, and all those who were following him were scattered.","So under the present circumstances, I say to you, do not meddle with these men, but let them alone. For if this scheme or this work is from men, it will be overthrown;","but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. Otherwise, you may even be found fighters against God himself.”","At this they took his advice, and they summoned the apostles, flogged  them, and ordered them to stop speaking on the basis of Jesus’ name, and let them go.","So they went out from before the Sanʹhe·drin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.","And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus."],["Now in those days when the disciples were increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began complaining against the Hebrew-speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.","So the Twelve called the multitude of the disciples together and said: “It is not right  for us to leave the word of God to distribute food to tables.","So, brothers, select for yourselves seven reputable men  from among you, full of spirit and wisdom, that we may appoint them over this necessary matter;","but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”","What they said was pleasing to the whole multitude, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and holy spirit, as well as Philip, Prochʹo·rus, Ni·caʹnor, Tiʹmon, Parʹme·nas, and Nic·o·laʹus, a proselyte of Antioch.","They brought them to the apostles, and after praying, they laid their hands on them.","Consequently, the word of God continued to spread, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much in Jerusalem; and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.","Now Stephen, full of divine favor and power, was performing great wonders  and signs among the people.","But some men of the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen came forward, along with some Cy·reʹni·ans and Alexandrians, and some from Ci·liʹcia and Asia, to dispute with Stephen.","But they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking.","Then they secretly persuaded men to say: “We have heard him speaking blasphemous things against Moses and God.”","And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him suddenly, they forcibly seized him and led him to the Sanʹhe·drin.","And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: “This man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the Law.","For instance, we have heard him say that this Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ will throw down this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”","And as all those sitting in the Sanʹhe·drin stared at him, they saw that his face was like an angel’s face."],["But the high priest said: “Are these things so?”","Stephen replied: “Men, brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham while he was in Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a, before he took up residence in Haʹran,","and he said to him: ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come into the land that I will show you.’","Then he went out of the land of the Chal·deʹans and took up residence in Haʹran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to resettle in this land where you now dwell.","And yet, he did not give him any inheritance in it, no, not even enough to put his foot on; but he promised to give it to him as a possession and after him to his offspring,  though as yet he had no child.","Moreover, God told him that his offspring  would be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people would enslave them and afflict  them for 400 years.","‘And that nation for which they will slave I will judge,’ God said, ‘and after these things they will come out and will offer sacred service to me in this place.’","“He also gave him a covenant of circumcision, and he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of  Jacob, and Jacob of the 12 family heads.","And the family heads became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,","and he rescued him out of all his tribulations and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharʹaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him to govern Egypt and his whole house.","But a famine came on all of Egypt and Caʹnaan, yes, a great tribulation, and our forefathers could not find anything to eat.","But Jacob heard that there were food supplies  in Egypt, and he sent our forefathers out the first time.","During the second time, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharʹaoh.","So Joseph sent a message and called his father Jacob and all his relatives from that place, 75 persons  in all.","So Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died  there, and so did our forefathers.","They were carried to Sheʹchem and were laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver money from the sons of Haʹmor in Sheʹchem.","“Just as the time was approaching to fulfill the promise that God had announced to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,","until there rose a different king over Egypt, one who did not know of Joseph.","This one dealt cunningly with our race and wrongfully forced the fathers to abandon their infants so that they would not be kept alive.","At that time Moses was born, and he was divinely beautiful.  And he was nursed  for three months in his father’s home.","But when he was abandoned,  the daughter of Pharʹaoh took him and brought him up as her own son.","So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. In fact, he was powerful in his words and deeds.","“Now when he reached the age of 40, it came into his heart  to make a visit on  his brothers, the sons of Israel.","When he caught sight of one of them being unjustly treated, he defended him and avenged the one being abused by striking down the Egyptian.","He thought that his brothers would grasp that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not grasp it.","The next day he appeared to them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying: ‘Men, you are brothers. Why do you mistreat each other?’","But the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed him away, saying: ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us?","You do not want to do away with me the way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’","On hearing this, Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midʹi·an, where he became the father of two sons.","“After 40 years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Siʹnai in the flame of a burning thornbush.","When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. But as he was approaching to investigate, Jehovah’s  voice was heard:","‘I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ Moses started trembling and did not dare to investigate further.","Jehovah  said to him: ‘Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.","I have certainly seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you off to Egypt.’","This same Moses whom they had disowned, saying: ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge?’ is the very one God sent as both ruler and deliverer by means of the angel who appeared to him in the thornbush.","This man led them out, performing wonders  and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for 40 years.","“This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel: ‘God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me.’","This is the one who came to be among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Siʹnai and  with our forefathers, and he received living sacred pronouncements to give us.","Our forefathers refused to obey him, but they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,","saying to Aaron: ‘Make gods for us to go ahead of us. For we do not know what has happened to this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt.’","So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands.","So God turned away from them and handed them over to offer sacred service to the army of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the Prophets: ‘It was not to me that you made offerings and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, was it, O house of Israel?","But it was the tent of Moʹloch and the star of the god Reʹphan that you took up, the images that you made to worship them. So I will deport you beyond Babylon.’","“Our forefathers had the tent of the witness in the wilderness, just as He gave orders when speaking to Moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen.","And our forefathers received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua into the land possessed by the nations, whom God drove out from before our forefathers. Here it remained until the days of David.","He found favor in the sight of God and asked for the privilege of providing a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.","But it was Solʹo·mon who built a house for him.","However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands, just as the prophet says:","‘The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What sort of house will you build for me? Jehovah  says. Or where is my resting-place?","My hand made all these things, did it not?’","“Obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you are always resisting the holy spirit; as your forefathers did, so you do.","Which one of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become,","you who received the Law as transmitted by angels but have not kept it.”","Well, at hearing these things, they were infuriated  in their hearts and began to grind their teeth at him.","But he, being full of holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God’s glory and of Jesus standing at God’s right hand,","and he said: “Look! I see the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand.”","At this they cried out at the top of their voices and put their hands over their ears and rushed at him all together.","After throwing him outside the city, they began stoning him. The witnesses laid down their outer garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.","As they were stoning Stephen, he made this appeal: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”","Then, kneeling down, he cried out with a strong voice: “Jehovah,  do not charge this sin against them.” And after saying this, he fell asleep in death."],["Saul, for his part, approved of his murder.","But devout men carried Stephen away to bury him, and they made a great mourning over him.","Saul, though, began to ravage the congregation. He would invade one house after another, dragging out both men and women and turning them over to prison.","However, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word.","Now Philip went down to the city  of Sa·marʹi·a and began to preach the Christ to them.","The crowds with one accord were paying attention to what Philip said while they listened and observed the signs he was performing.","For many had unclean spirits, and these would cry out with a loud voice and come out. Moreover, many who were paralyzed and lame were cured.","So there came to be a great deal of joy in that city.","Now in the city was a man named Simon, who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Sa·marʹi·a, claiming that he was somebody great.","All of them, from the least to the greatest, would pay attention to him and say: “This man is the Power of God, which is called Great.”","So they would pay attention to him because he had amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts.","But when they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were getting baptized.","Simon himself also became a believer, and after being baptized, he continued with Philip; and he was amazed at seeing the signs and great powerful works taking place.","When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Sa·marʹi·a had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them;","and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit.","For it had not yet come upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","Then they laid their hands on them, and they began to receive holy spirit.","Now when Simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,","saying: “Give me this authority also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive holy spirit.”","But Peter said to him: “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire the free gift of God with money.","You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not straight in the sight of God.","So repent of this badness of yours, and supplicate Jehovah  that, if possible, the wicked intention of your heart may be forgiven you;","for I see you are a bitter poison  and a slave of unrighteousness.”","In answer Simon said to them: “Make supplication for me to Jehovah  that none of the things you have said may come upon me.”","Therefore, when they had given the witness thoroughly and had spoken the word of Jehovah,  they started back toward Jerusalem, and they went declaring the good news to many villages of the Sa·marʹi·tans.","However, Jehovah’s  angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Get up and go to the south to the  road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gazʹa.” (This is a desert road.)","With that he got up and went, and look! an E·thi·oʹpi·an eunuch,  a man who had authority under Can·daʹce, queen of the E·thi·oʹpi·ans, and who was in charge of all her treasure. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,","and he was returning and was sitting in his chariot, reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.","So the spirit said to Philip: “Go over and approach this chariot.”","Philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you actually know  what you are reading?”","He said: “Really, how could I ever do so unless someone guided me?” So he urged Philip to get on and sit down with him.","Now this was the passage of Scripture that he was reading: “Like a sheep he was brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.","During his humiliation, justice was taken away from him. Who will tell the details of his generation? Because his life is taken away from the earth.”","The eunuch then said to Philip: “I beg you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about some other man?”","Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus.","Now as they were going along the road, they came to a body of water, and the eunuch said: “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”","——","With that he commanded the chariot to halt, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.","When they came up out of the water, Jehovah’s  spirit quickly led Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, but he went on his way rejoicing.","Philip, however, found himself in Ashʹdod, and he went through the territory and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to Caes·a·reʹa."],["But Saul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest","and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that he might bring bound to Jerusalem any whom he found who belonged to The Way, both men and women.","Now as he was traveling and getting near Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him,","and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”","He asked: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.","But get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”","Now the men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing, indeed, the sound of a voice but seeing no one.","Saul then got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.","And for three days he did not see anything, and he neither ate nor drank.","There was a disciple named An·a·niʹas in Damascus, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “An·a·niʹas!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.”","The Lord said to him: “Get up, go to the street called Straight, and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus, at the house of Judas. For look!  he is praying,","and in a vision he has seen a man named An·a·niʹas come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight.”","But An·a·niʹas answered: “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.","And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest  all those calling on your name.”","But the Lord said to him: “Go! because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.","For I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.”","So An·a·niʹas went and entered the house, and he laid his hands on him and said: “Saul, brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road along which you were coming, has sent me so that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit.”","And immediately, what looked like scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight. He then got up and was baptized,","and he ate some food and gained strength.","and immediately in the synagogues he began to preach about Jesus, that this one is the Son of God.","But all those hearing him were astonished and were saying: “Is this not the man who ravaged those in Jerusalem who call on this name? Did he not come here for the purpose of arresting them and taking them  to the chief priests?”","But Saul kept on acquiring more and more power and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, as he proved logically that this is the Christ.","Now when many days had passed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him.","However, their plot against Saul became known to him. They were also watching the gates closely both day and night in order to do away with him.","So his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.","On arriving in Jerusalem, he made efforts to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a disciple.","So Barʹna·bas came to his aid and led him to the apostles, and he told them in detail how on the road he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.","So he remained with them, moving about freely in  Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.","He was talking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews, but these made attempts to do away with him.","When the brothers found out about this, they brought him down to Caes·a·reʹa and sent him off to Tarsus.","Then, indeed, the congregation throughout the whole of Ju·deʹa and Galʹi·lee and Sa·marʹi·a entered into a period of peace, being built up; and as it walked in the fear of Jehovah  and in the comfort of the holy spirit, it kept on multiplying.","Now as Peter was traveling through all the region, he came down also to the holy ones who lived in Lydʹda.","There he found a man named Ae·neʹas, who had been lying flat on his bed for eight years, for he was paralyzed.","Peter said to him: “Ae·neʹas, Jesus Christ  heals you. Rise and make up your bed.” And he got up immediately.","When all those living in Lydʹda and the Plain of Sharʹon saw him, they turned to the Lord.","Now there was in Jopʹpa a disciple named Tabʹi·tha, which means, when translated, “Dorʹcas.”  She abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy that she was making.","But in those days she fell sick and died. So they bathed her and laid her in an upper room.","Since Lydʹda was near Jopʹpa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city, they sent two men to him to urge him: “Please come to us without delay.”","At that Peter got up and went with them. And when he arrived, they led him up into the upper room; and all the widows presented themselves to him, weeping and showing many garments and robes  that Dorʹcas had made while she was with them.","Peter then put everyone outside, and kneeling down, he prayed. Then turning toward the body, he said: “Tabʹi·tha, rise!” She opened her eyes, and as she caught sight of Peter, she sat up.","Giving her his hand, he raised her up, and he called the holy ones and the widows and presented her alive.","This became known throughout all Jopʹpa, and many became believers in the Lord.","He remained for quite a few days in Jopʹpa with a tanner named Simon."],["Now there was a man in Caes·a·reʹa named Cornelius, an army officer  in what was called the Italian unit.","He was a devout man who feared God together with all his household, and he made many gifts of mercy to the people and made supplication to God continually.","About the ninth hour of the day,  he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God come in to him and say: “Cornelius!”","Cornelius stared at him, terrified, and asked: “What is it, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and gifts of mercy have ascended as a remembrance before God.","So now send men to Jopʹpa and summon a man named Simon who is called Peter.","This man is staying as a guest with  Simon, a tanner who has a house by the sea.”","As soon as the angel who spoke to him left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who were his attendants,","and he related everything to them and sent them to Jopʹpa.","The next day as they were continuing on their journey and were approaching the city, Peter went up to the housetop about the sixth hour  to pray.","But he became very hungry and wanted to eat. While they were preparing the meal, he fell into a trance","and saw heaven opened and something  descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners on the earth;","and in it were all sorts of four-footed animals and reptiles  of the earth and birds of heaven.","Then a voice said to him: “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!”","But Peter said: “Not at all, Lord, because I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.”","And the voice spoke again to him, the second time: “Stop calling defiled the things God has  cleansed.”","This happened a third time, and immediately it  was taken up into heaven.","While Peter was still perplexed about what the vision he had seen could mean, just then the men sent by Cornelius asked where Simon’s house was and stood there at the gate.","They called out and inquired whether Simon who was called Peter was a guest there.","As Peter was still pondering over the vision, the spirit said: “Look! Three men are asking for you.","So get up, go downstairs and go with them, not doubting at all, because I have sent them.”","Then Peter went downstairs to the men and said: “Here I am, the one you are looking for. Why are you here?”","They said: “Cornelius, an army officer, a righteous and God-fearing man who is well-reported-on by the whole nation of the Jews, was given divine instructions by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.”","So he invited them in and had them stay as his guests.","The following day he entered into Caes·a·reʹa. Cornelius, of course, was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.","As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and did obeisance  to him.","But Peter lifted him up, saying: “Rise; I too am just a man.”","As he conversed with him, he went in and found many people assembled.","He said to them: “You well know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or approach a man of another race, and yet God has shown me that I should call no man defiled or unclean.","So I came, really without objection, when I was sent for. Therefore, I ask you why you sent for me.”","Then Cornelius said: “Four days ago counting from this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour;  just then a man in bright clothing stood in front of me","and said: ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.","Therefore, send to Jopʹpa and call for Simon who is called Peter. This man is a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’","I then sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come here. So now we are all present before God to hear all the things you have been commanded by Jehovah  to say.”","At this Peter began to speak, and he said: “Now I truly understand that God is not partial,","but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.","He sent out the word to the sons of Israel to declare to them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ—this one is Lord of all.","You know the subject that was talked about throughout all Ju·deʹa, starting from Galʹi·lee after the baptism that John preached:","about Jesus who was from Nazʹa·reth, how God anointed him with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him.","And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; but they did away  with him by hanging him on a stake.","God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest,","not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.","Also, he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.","To him all the prophets bear witness, that everyone putting faith in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”","While Peter was still speaking about these matters, the holy spirit came upon all those hearing the word.","And the circumcised believers  who had come with Peter were amazed, because the free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also on people of the nations.","For they heard them speaking in foreign languages  and magnifying God. Then Peter responded:","“Can anyone deny water to prevent these from being baptized who have received the holy spirit just as we have?”","With that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested him to stay for some days."],["Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Ju·deʹa heard that people of the nations had also accepted the word of God.","So when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the supporters of circumcision began to criticize  him,","saying: “You went into the house of men who were not circumcised and ate with them.”","At this Peter went on to explain the matter in detail to them, saying:","“I was in the city of Jopʹpa praying, and while in a trance I saw a vision, something  descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners from heaven, and it came right down to me.","Looking closely into it, I observed four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles,  and birds of heaven.","I also heard a voice say to me: ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’","But I said: ‘Certainly not, Lord, because a defiled or unclean thing has never entered my mouth.’","The second time, the voice from heaven answered: ‘You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.’","This happened a third time, and everything was pulled up again into heaven.","Also just at that moment, three men were standing at the house where we were staying, having been sent to me from Caes·a·reʹa.","Then the spirit told me to go with them, not doubting at all. But these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.","“He reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say: ‘Send men to Jopʹpa and summon Simon who is called Peter,","and he will tell you things by which you and all your household may get saved.’","But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell on them just as it did also on us in the beginning.","At this I recalled the saying of the Lord, how he used to say: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with holy spirit.’","If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them that he gave to us who  have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?”","When they heard these things, they stopped objecting,  and they glorified God, saying: “So, then, God has also granted to people of the nations repentance leading to life.”","Now those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went as far as Phoe·niʹcia, Cyʹprus, and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews.","However, some of the men among them from Cyʹprus and Cy·reʹne came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus.","Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah  was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.","The report about them reached the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barʹna·bas as far as Antioch.","When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with heartfelt resolve;","for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.","So he went to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul.","After he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they assembled with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.","In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.","One of them named Agʹa·bus stood up and foretold through the spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth, which, in fact, did take place in the time of Claudius.","So the disciples determined, each according to what he could afford, to send relief  to the brothers living in Ju·deʹa;","and this they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barʹna·bas and Saul."],["About that time Herod the king began mistreating some of those of the congregation.","He put James the brother of John to death by the sword.","When he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he also went on to arrest Peter. (This was during the days of the Unleavened Bread.)","He seized him and put him in prison, turning him over to four shifts of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out  before the people after the Passover.","So Peter was being kept in the prison, but the congregation was intensely praying to God for him.","When Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping bound with two chains between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison.","But look! Jehovah’s  angel was standing there, and a light shone in the prison cell. Hitting Peter on the side, he woke him, saying: “Get up quickly!” And the chains fell off his hands.","The angel said to him: “Get dressed  and put on your sandals.” He did so. Finally he said to him: “Put your outer garment on, and keep following me.”","And he went out and kept following him, but  he did not know that what was happening through the angel was real. In fact, he thought he was seeing a vision.","Going past the first sentinel guard and the second, they reached the iron gate leading into the city, and this opened to them by itself. After they went out, they made their way down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.","And Peter, realizing what was happening, said: “Now I know for sure that Jehovah  sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s hand and from everything that the Jews were expecting to happen.”","After he realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who was called Mark, where quite a few were gathered together and were praying.","When he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the call.","On recognizing the voice of Peter, she was so overjoyed that she did not open the gate, but ran inside and reported that Peter was standing at the gateway.","They said to her: “You are out of your mind.” But she kept insisting that it was so. They began to say: “It is his angel.”","But Peter remained there, knocking. When they opened the door, they saw him and were astonished.","But he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and told them in detail how Jehovah  had brought him out of the prison, and he said: “Report these things to James and the brothers.” With that he went out and traveled to another place.","Now when it became day, there was quite a disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.","Herod made a diligent search for him, and not finding him, he interrogated the guards and commanded them to be led off to punishment; and he went down from Ju·deʹa to Caes·a·reʹa and spent some time there.","Now he was in an angry  mood against the people of Tyre and Siʹdon. So they came to him with one purpose, and after persuading Blastus, the man in charge of the king’s household affairs,  they sued for peace, because their country was supplied with food from the land of the king.","On a set day, Herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down on the judgment seat and began giving them a public address.","Then the people who were assembled began shouting: “A god’s voice, and not a man’s!”","Instantly the angel of Jehovah  struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten up with worms and died.","But the word of Jehovah  went on growing and spreading.","As for Barʹna·bas and Saul, after fully carrying out the relief work in Jerusalem, they returned and took along with them John, the one also called Mark."],["Now in Antioch there were prophets and teachers in the local congregation: Barʹna·bas, Symʹe·on who was called Niʹger, Lucius of Cy·reʹne, Manʹa·en who was educated with Herod the district ruler, and Saul.","As they were ministering  to Jehovah  and fasting, the holy spirit said: “Set aside for me Barʹna·bas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”","Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.","So these men, sent out by the holy spirit, went down to Se·leuʹcia, and from there they sailed away to Cyʹprus.","When they arrived in Salʹa·mis, they began proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as an attendant.","When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paʹphos, they met up with a Jewish man named Bar-Jeʹsus, who was a sorcerer and a false prophet.","He was with the proconsul  Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. Calling Barʹna·bas and Saul to him, this man was eager to hear the word of God.","But Elʹy·mas the sorcerer (for that is how his name is translated) began opposing them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith.","Then Saul, also called Paul, becoming filled with holy spirit, looked at him intently","and said: “O man full of every sort of fraud and every sort of villainy, you son of the Devil, you enemy of everything righteous, will you not quit distorting the right ways of Jehovah?","Look! Jehovah’s  hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a time.” Instantly a thick mist and darkness fell on him, and he went around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand.","Then the proconsul, on seeing what had happened, became a believer, for he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah.","Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paʹphos and arrived at Perga in Pam·phylʹi·a. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.","However, they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pi·sidʹi·a. And going into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they took a seat.","After the public reading of the Law and the Prophets, the presiding officers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, tell it.”","So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said:","The God of this people Israel chose our forefathers, and he exalted the people while they lived as foreigners in the land of Egypt and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm.","And for a period of about 40 years, he put up with them in the wilderness.","After destroying seven nations in the land of Caʹnaan, he assigned their land as an inheritance.","All of that was during about 450 years.","But afterward they demanded a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years.","After removing him, he raised up for them David as king, about whom he bore witness and said: ‘I have found David the son of Jesʹse a man agreeable to my heart; he will do all the things I desire.’","According to his promise, from the offspring  of this man, God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus.","Before the arrival of that one, John had preached publicly to all the people of Israel baptism in symbol of repentance.","But as John was finishing his course, he would say: ‘What do you suppose I am? I am not he. But look! One is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’","“Men, brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family and those others among you who fear God, the word of this salvation has been sent to us.","For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize this one, but when acting as judges, they fulfilled the things spoken by the Prophets, which are read aloud every sabbath.","Even though they found no cause for death, they demanded of Pilate to have him executed.","And when they had accomplished all the things written about him, they took him down from the stake  and laid him in a tomb.","But God raised him up from the dead,","and for many days he became visible to those who had gone with him from Galʹi·lee up to Jerusalem. These are now his witnesses to the people.","“So we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers.","God has completely fulfilled it to us, their children, by resurrecting Jesus; just as it is written in the second psalm: ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’","And the fact that He resurrected him from the dead never again to return to corruption, He has stated in this way: ‘I will give you the expressions of loyal love promised to David, which are faithful.’","So it also says in another psalm: ‘You will not allow your loyal one to see corruption.’","David, on the one hand, rendered service to God  in his own generation, fell asleep in death, was laid with his forefathers, and did see corruption.","On the other hand, the one whom God raised up did not see corruption.","“Let it therefore be known to you, brothers, that through this one a forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,","and that from all the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the Law of Moses, everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this one.","Therefore, watch out that what is said in the Prophets does not come upon you:","‘Look at it, you scorners, and be amazed, and perish, for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never believe even if anyone relates it to you in detail.’”","Now when they were going out, the people pleaded with them to speak about these matters on the following Sabbath.","So after the synagogue assembly was dismissed, many of the Jews and the proselytes who worshipped God followed Paul and Barʹna·bas, who, as they spoke to them, urged them to remain in the undeserved kindness of God.","The next Sabbath nearly all the city gathered together to hear the word of Jehovah.","When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things Paul was saying.","Then Paul and Barʹna·bas boldly said to them: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are rejecting it and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations.","For Jehovah  has commanded us in these words: ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be  a salvation to the ends of the earth.’”","When those of the nations heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah,  and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.","Furthermore, the word of Jehovah  was being spread throughout the whole country.","But the Jews incited the prominent women who were God-fearing and the principal men of the city, and they stirred up persecution against Paul and Barʹna·bas and threw them outside their boundaries.","So they shook the dust off their feet against them and went to I·coʹni·um.","And the disciples continued to be filled with joy and holy spirit."],["Now in I·coʹni·um they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks became believers.","But the Jews who did not believe stirred up and wrongly influenced the people  of the nations against the brothers.","So they spent considerable time speaking with boldness by the authority of Jehovah,  who bore witness to the word of his undeserved kindness by allowing signs and wonders  to be performed through them.","However, the multitude of the city was divided; some were for the Jews but others for the apostles.","When both the people of the nations and the Jews with their rulers made an attempt to treat them insolently and stone them,","they were informed of it, and they fled to the cities of Lyc·a·oʹni·a, Lysʹtra and Derʹbe, and to the surrounding country.","There they went on declaring the good news.","Now in Lysʹtra there was a man sitting down whose feet were crippled. He was lame from birth and had never walked.","This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,","said with a loud voice: “Stand up on your feet.” So the man leaped up and began walking.","When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they cried out in the Lyc·a·oʹni·an language: “The gods have become like humans and have come down to us!”","And they started calling Barʹna·bas Zeus, but Paul Herʹmes, since he was taking the lead in speaking.","And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance of the city, brought bulls and garlands  to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifices with the crowds.","However, when the apostles Barʹna·bas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their garments and leaped out into the crowd and cried out:","“Men, why are you doing these things? We too are humans having the same infirmities as you have. And we are declaring the good news to you, for you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them.","In past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways,","although he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.”","And yet despite saying these things, they barely  restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.","But Jews arrived from Antioch and I·coʹni·um and persuaded the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining that he was dead.","However, when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and entered the city. On the next day he left with Barʹna·bas for Derʹbe.","After declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples, they returned to Lysʹtra, I·coʹni·um, and Antioch.","There they strengthened the disciples,  encouraging them to remain in the faith and saying: “We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations.”","Moreover, they appointed elders for them in each congregation, offering prayer with fasting, and they entrusted them to Jehovah,  in whom they had become believers.","Then they went through Pi·sidʹi·a and came into Pam·phylʹi·a,","and after proclaiming the word in Perga, they went down to At·ta·liʹa.","From there they sailed off for Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of God for the work they had now completed.","When they had arrived and had gathered the congregation together, they related the many things God had done by means of them, and that he had opened to the nations the door to faith.","So they spent considerable time with the disciples."],["Now some men came down from Ju·deʹa and began to teach the brothers: “Unless you get circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”","But after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by Paul and Barʹna·bas with them, it was arranged for Paul, Barʹna·bas, and some of the others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.","So after being escorted partway by the congregation, these men continued on through both Phoe·niʹcia and Sa·marʹi·a, relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations and bringing great joy to all the brothers.","On arriving in Jerusalem, they were kindly received by the congregation and the apostles and the elders, and they related the many things God had done by means of them.","But some of those of the sect of the Pharisees who had become believers stood up from their seats and said: “It is necessary to circumcise them and command them to observe the Law of Moses.”","So the apostles and the elders gathered together to look into this matter.","After much intense discussion  had taken place, Peter rose and said to them: “Men, brothers, you well know that from early days God made the choice among you that through my mouth people of the nations should hear the word of the good news and believe.","And God, who knows the heart, bore witness by giving them the holy spirit, just as he did to us also.","And he made no distinction at all between us and them, but purified their hearts by faith.","So why are you now making a test of God by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we were capable of bearing?","On the contrary, we have faith that we are saved through the undeserved  kindness of the Lord Jesus in the same way that they are.”","At that the entire group became silent, and they began to listen to Barʹna·bas and Paul relate the many signs and wonders  that God had done through them among the nations.","After they finished speaking, James replied: “Men, brothers, hear me.","Symʹe·on has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.","And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written:","‘After these things I will return and raise up again the tent  of David that is fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,","so that the men who remain may earnestly seek Jehovah,  together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah,  who is doing these things,","known from of old.’","Therefore, my decision  is not to trouble those from the nations who are turning to God,","but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality,  from what is strangled,  and from blood.","For from ancient times Moses has had those who preach him in city after city, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath.”","Then the apostles and the elders, together with the whole congregation, decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch, along with Paul and Barʹna·bas; they sent Judas who was called Barʹsab·bas and Silas, who were leading men among the brothers.","They wrote this and sent it through them:","Since we have heard that some went out from among us and caused you trouble with what they have said, trying to subvert you,  although we did not give them any instructions,","we have come to a unanimous decision to choose men to send to you together with our beloved Barʹna·bas and Paul,","men who have given up their lives  for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.","We are therefore sending Judas and Silas, so that they also may report the same things by word of mouth.","For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things:","to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled,  and from sexual immorality.  If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!”","So when these men were dismissed, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the whole group together and handed them the letter.","After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.","And Judas and Silas, since they were also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many talks and strengthened them.","After they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.","——","But  Paul and Barʹna·bas stayed in Antioch, teaching and declaring, along with many others, the good news of the word of Jehovah.","After some days, Paul said to Barʹna·bas: “Let us now  return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities where we proclaimed the word of Jehovah,  to see how they are.”","Barʹna·bas was determined to take along John, who was called Mark.","Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them, seeing that he had departed from them in Pam·phylʹi·a and had not gone with them to the work.","At this there was a sharp burst of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barʹna·bas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyʹprus.","Paul selected Silas and departed after he had been entrusted by the brothers to the undeserved kindness of Jehovah.","He went through Syria and Ci·liʹcia, strengthening the congregations."],["So he arrived at Derʹbe and also at Lysʹtra. And a disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father,","and he was well-reported-on by the brothers in Lysʹtra and I·coʹni·um.","Paul expressed the desire for Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.","As they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.","Then, indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.","Moreover, they traveled through Phrygʹi·a and the country of Ga·laʹti·a, because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the province of Asia.","Further, when they came down to Mysʹi·a, they made efforts to go into Bi·thynʹi·a, but the spirit of Jesus did not permit them.","So they passed by  Mysʹi·a and came down to Troʹas.","And during the night a vision appeared to Paul—a Mac·e·doʹni·an man was standing there urging him and saying: “Step over into Mac·e·doʹni·a and help us.”","As soon as he had seen the vision, we tried to go into Mac·e·doʹni·a, drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.","So we put out to sea from Troʹas and made a straight run to Samʹo·thrace, but on the following day to Ne·apʹo·lis;","and from there we went to Phi·lipʹpi, a colony, which is the principal city of the district of Mac·e·doʹni·a. We stayed in this city for some days.","On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate beside a river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.","And a woman named Lydʹi·a, a seller of purple from the city of Thy·a·tiʹra and a worshipper of God, was listening, and Jehovah  opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things Paul was saying.","Now when she and her household got baptized, she urged us: “If you have considered me to be faithful to Jehovah,  come and stay at my house.” And she just made us come.","Now it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a servant girl with a spirit, a demon of divination, met us. She supplied her masters with much profit by fortune-telling.","This girl kept following Paul and us and crying out with the words: “These men are slaves of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.”","She kept doing this for many days. Finally Paul got tired of it and turned and said to the spirit: “I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.","Well, when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.","Leading them up to the civil magistrates, they said: “These men are disturbing our city very much. They are Jews,","and they are proclaiming customs that it is not lawful for us to adopt or practice, seeing that we are Romans.”","And the crowd rose up together against them, and the civil magistrates, after tearing the garments off them, gave the command to beat them with rods.","After they had inflicted many blows on them, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely.","Because he got such an order, he threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.","But about the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song, and the prisoners were listening to them.","Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the jail were shaken. Moreover, all the doors were instantly opened, and everyone’s bonds came loose.","When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, assuming that the prisoners had escaped.","But Paul called out with a loud voice: “Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!”","So he asked for lights and rushed in, and seized with trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas.","He brought them outside and said: “Sirs, what must I do to get saved?”","They said: “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will get saved, you and your household.”","Then they spoke the word of Jehovah  to him together with all those in his house.","And he took them along in that hour of the night and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire household were baptized without delay.","He brought them into his house and set a table before them, and he rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed in God.","When it became day, the civil magistrates sent the constables to say: “Release those men.”","The jailer reported their words to Paul: “The civil magistrates have sent men to have you two released. So come out now and go in peace.”","But Paul said to them: “They flogged us publicly, uncondemned,  though we are Romans, and threw us into prison. Are they now throwing us out secretly? No, indeed! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”","The constables reported these words to the civil magistrates. These grew fearful when they heard that the men were Romans.","So they  came and pleaded with them, and after escorting them out, they requested them to depart from the city.","But they came out of the prison and went to the home of Lydʹi·a; and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and departed."],["They now traveled through Am·phipʹo·lis and Ap·ol·loʹni·a and came to Thes·sa·lo·niʹca, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.","So according to Paul’s custom he went inside to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,","explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, saying: “This is the Christ, this Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you.”","As a result, some of them became believers and associated themselves with Paul and Silas, and so did a great multitude of the Greeks who worshipped God, along with quite a few of the principal women.","But the Jews, getting jealous, gathered together some wicked men who were loitering at the marketplace and formed a mob and proceeded to throw the city into an uproar. They assaulted the house of Jaʹson and were seeking to have Paul and Silas brought out to the mob.","When they did not find them, they dragged Jaʹson and some of the brothers to the city rulers, crying out: “These men who have overturned  the inhabited earth are present here also,","and Jaʹson has received them as his guests. All these men act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.”","When they heard these things, the crowd and the city rulers were alarmed;","and after taking sufficient security  from Jaʹson and the others, they let them go.","Immediately by night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Be·roeʹa. On arriving, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.","Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thes·sa·lo·niʹca, for they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.","Therefore, many of them became believers, and so did quite a few of the reputable Greek women as well as some of the men.","But when the Jews from Thes·sa·lo·niʹca learned that the word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul in Be·roeʹa, they came there to incite and agitate the crowds.","Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained behind there.","However, those accompanying Paul brought him as far as Athens, and they departed after receiving instructions that Silas and Timothy should come to Paul as quickly as possible.","Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit within him became irritated on seeing that the city was full of idols.","So he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshipped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.","But some of both the Ep·i·cu·reʹan and the Stoʹic philosophers began disputing with him, and some were saying: “What is it this chatterer would like to tell?” Others: “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities.” This was because  he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.","So they took hold of him and led him to the Ar·e·opʹa·gus, saying: “Can we get to know what this new teaching is that you are speaking about?","For you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears, and we want to know what these things mean.”","In fact, all Athenians and the foreigners staying  there would spend their leisure time doing nothing else but telling or listening to something new.","Paul now stood in the midst of the Ar·e·opʹa·gus and said:","For instance, while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration,  I found even an altar on which had been inscribed ‘To an Unknown God.’ Therefore, what you are unknowingly worshipping, this I am declaring to you.","The God who made the world and all the things in it, being, as he is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples;","nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things.","And he made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of where men would dwell,","so that they would seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.","For by him we have life and move and exist, even as some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his children.’","“Therefore, since we are the children  of God, we should not think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, like something sculptured by the art and design of humans.","True, God has overlooked the times of such ignorance; but now he is declaring to all people everywhere that they should repent.","Because he has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has provided a guarantee to all men by resurrecting him from the dead.”","Now when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to scoff, while others said: “We will hear you again about this.”","So Paul left them,","but some men joined him and became believers. Among them were Di·o·nysʹi·us, who was a judge of the court of the Ar·e·opʹa·gus, and a woman named Damʹa·ris, and others besides them."],["After this he departed from Athens and came to Corinth.","And he found a Jew named Aqʹui·la, a native of Ponʹtus who had recently come from Italy with Pris·cilʹla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. So he went to them,","and because he had the same trade, he stayed at their home and worked with them, for they were tentmakers by trade.","He would give a talk  in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks.","When, now, both Silas and Timothy came down from Mac·e·doʹni·a, Paul began to be intensely  occupied with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ.","But after they kept on opposing him and speaking abusively, he shook out his garments and said to them: “Let your blood be on your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to people of the nations.”","So he transferred from there  and went into the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.","But Crisʹpus, the presiding officer of the synagogue, became a believer in the Lord, along with all his household. And many of the Corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized.","Moreover, the Lord said to Paul in a vision by night: “Do not be afraid, but keep on speaking and do not keep silent,","for I am with you and no man will assault you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.”","So he stayed there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","While Galʹli·o was proconsul  of A·chaʹia, the Jews made a concerted attack against Paul and led him to the judgment seat,","saying: “This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law.”","But as Paul was about to speak, Galʹli·o said to the Jews: “If, indeed, it were some wrong or a serious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear you out patiently.","But if it is controversies over speech and names and your own law, you yourselves must see to it. I do not wish to be a judge of these things.”","With that he drove them away from the judgment seat.","So they all seized Sosʹthe·nes, the presiding officer of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Galʹli·o would not get involved at all with these things.","However, after staying quite a few days longer, Paul said good-bye to the brothers and sailed away for Syria, accompanied by Pris·cilʹla and Aqʹui·la. He had his hair clipped short in Cenʹchre·ae, for he had made a vow.","So they arrived at Ephʹe·sus, and he left them there; but he entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.","Although they kept requesting him to stay longer, he would not consent","but said good-bye and told them: “I will return to you again, if Jehovah  is willing.” And he put out to sea from Ephʹe·sus","and came down to Caes·a·reʹa. And he went up  and greeted the congregation and then went down to Antioch.","After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the country of Ga·laʹti·a and Phrygʹi·a, strengthening all the disciples.","Now a Jew named A·polʹlos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephʹe·sus; he was an eloquent man who was well-versed in the Scriptures.","This man had been instructed  in the way of Jehovah,  and aglow with the spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, but he was acquainted only with the baptism of John.","He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and when Pris·cilʹla and Aqʹui·la heard him, they took him into their company and explained the  way of God more accurately to him.","Further, because he wanted to go across to A·chaʹia, the brothers wrote to the disciples, urging them to receive him kindly. So when he got there, he greatly helped those who through God’s undeserved kindness had become believers;","for publicly and with great intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong, showing them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ."],["In the course of events, while A·polʹlos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland regions and came down to Ephʹe·sus. There he found some disciples","and said to them: “Did you receive holy spirit when you became believers?” They replied to him: “Why, we have never heard that there is a holy spirit.”","So he said: “In what, then, were you baptized?” They said: “In John’s baptism.”","Paul said: “John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”","On hearing this, they got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","And when Paul laid his hands on them, the holy spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in foreign languages and prophesying.","There were about 12 men in all.","Entering the synagogue, for three months he spoke with boldness, giving talks and reasoning persuasively about the Kingdom of God.","But when some stubbornly refused to believe,  speaking injuriously about The Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them, giving talks daily in the school auditorium of Ty·ranʹnus.","This went on for two years, so that all those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.","And God kept performing extraordinary powerful works through the hands of Paul,","so that even cloths and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits came out.","But some of the Jews who traveled around casting out demons also tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits; they would say: “I solemnly charge you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.”","Now there were seven sons of a Jewish chief priest named Sceʹva doing this.","But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: “I know Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?”","At that the man with the wicked spirit leaped on them, overpowered them one after the other, and prevailed against them, so that they fled naked and wounded out of that house.","This became known to all, both the Jews and the Greeks who lived in Ephʹe·sus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus went on being magnified.","And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly.","Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. And they calculated their value and found them worth 50,000 pieces of silver.","Thus in a mighty way, the  word of Jehovah  kept growing and prevailing.","After these things had taken place, Paul resolved in his spirit that after going through Mac·e·doʹni·a and A·chaʹia, he would travel to Jerusalem. He said: “After going there, I must also see Rome.”","So he sent to Mac·e·doʹni·a two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and E·rasʹtus, but he himself stayed on for some time in the province of Asia.","At that time quite a disturbance arose concerning The Way.","For a man named De·meʹtri·us, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Arʹte·mis, brought considerable profit to the craftsmen.","He gathered them and others who worked at such things and said: “Men, you well know that from this business comes our prosperity.","Now you see and hear how, not only in Ephʹe·sus but in nearly all the province of Asia, this Paul has persuaded a considerable crowd and turned them to another opinion, saying that the gods made by hands are not really gods.","Moreover, the danger exists not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Arʹte·mis will be viewed as nothing, and she who is worshipped in the whole province of Asia and the inhabited earth will be deprived of her magnificence.”","Hearing this and becoming full of anger, the men began crying out: “Great is Arʹte·mis of the E·pheʹsians!”","So the city became filled with confusion, and all together they rushed into the theater, dragging along with them Gaʹius and Ar·is·tarʹchus, Mac·e·doʹni·ans, traveling companions of Paul.","For his part, Paul was willing to go inside to the people, but the disciples would not permit him.","Even some of the commissioners of festivals and games who were friendly to him sent word to him, pleading with him not to risk going into the theater.","Some were, in fact, crying out one thing and others something else; for the assembly was in confusion and the majority of them did not know the reason why they had come together.","So they brought Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews shoving him forward, and Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make his defense to the people.","But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all started shouting in unison for about two hours: “Great is Arʹte·mis of the E·pheʹsians!”","When the city recorder had finally quieted the crowd, he said: “Men of Ephʹe·sus, who really is there among men who does not know that the city of the E·pheʹsians is the temple keeper of the great Arʹte·mis and of the image that fell from heaven?","Since these things are indisputable, you should keep calm and not act rashly.","For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.","So if De·meʹtri·us and the craftsmen with him do have a case against someone, court days are held and there are proconsuls;  let them bring charges against one another.","But if you are searching for anything beyond that, it must be decided in a regular assembly.","For we are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, since there are no  grounds we could present as a reason for this disorderly mob.”","And after saying this, he dismissed the assembly."],["When the uproar had subsided, Paul sent for the disciples, and after he had encouraged them and said farewell, he began his journey to Mac·e·doʹni·a.","After going through those regions and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there, he arrived in Greece.","He spent three months there, but because a plot was hatched against him by the Jews when he was about to set sail for Syria, he made up his mind to return through Mac·e·doʹni·a.","He was accompanied by Sopʹa·ter the son of Pyrʹrhus of Be·roeʹa, Ar·is·tarʹchus and Se·cunʹdus of the Thes·sa·loʹni·ans, Gaʹius of Derʹbe, Timothy and, from the province of Asia, Tychʹi·cus and Trophʹi·mus.","These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troʹas;","but we put out to sea from Phi·lipʹpi after the days of the Unleavened Bread, and within five days we came to them in Troʹas, and there we spent seven days.","On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to have a meal, Paul began addressing them, as he was going to depart the next day; and he prolonged his speech until midnight.","So there were quite a few lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.","Seated at the window, a young man named Euʹty·chus sank into a deep sleep while Paul kept talking, and overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.","But Paul went downstairs, threw himself on him and embraced him, and said: “Stop making a commotion, for he is alive.”","He then went upstairs and began the meal  and ate. He continued conversing for quite a while, until daybreak, and then he departed.","So they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure.","We now went ahead to the ship and set sail for Asʹsos, where we were intending to take Paul aboard, for after giving instructions to this effect, he was intending to go there on foot.","So when he caught up with us in Asʹsos, we took him aboard and went to Mit·y·leʹne.","And sailing away from there the next day, we arrived off Chiʹos, but the day after that, we touched at Saʹmos, and on the following day, we arrived at Mi·leʹtus.","Paul had decided to sail past Ephʹe·sus so as not to spend any time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem on the day of the Festival of Pentecost if he possibly could.","However, from Mi·leʹtus he sent word to Ephʹe·sus and called for the elders of the congregation.","When they came to him, he said to them: “You well know how I conducted myself among you from the first day I stepped into the province of Asia,","slaving for the Lord with all humility  and with tears and trials that befell me by the plots of the Jews,","while I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable  nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.","But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.","And now look! bound in  the spirit, I am traveling to Jerusalem, although not knowing what will happen to me  there,","except that from city to city the holy spirit repeatedly bears witness to me, saying that imprisonment and tribulations are waiting for me.","Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life  of any importance to me,  if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.","“And now look! I know that none of you among whom I preached the Kingdom will ever see my face again.","So I call you to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood of all men,","for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel  of God.","Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.","I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness,","and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.","“Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that for three years, night and day, I never stopped admonishing each one of you with tears.","And now I entrust you to God and to the word of his undeserved kindness, which word can build you up and give you the inheritance among all the sanctified ones.","I have desired no man’s silver or gold or clothing.","You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my own needs and the needs of those with me.","I have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way, you must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said: ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’”","And when he had said these things, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.","Indeed, quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all, and they embraced Paul  and affectionately  kissed him,","for they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they would not see his face anymore. Then they accompanied him to the ship."],["After tearing ourselves away from them and putting out to sea, we ran with a straight course and came to Cos, on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patʹa·ra.","When we found a ship that was crossing to Phoe·niʹcia, we went aboard and sailed away.","After coming in sight of the island of Cyʹprus, we left it behind on the left side  and sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo.","We searched for and found the disciples and remained there for seven days. But through the spirit they repeatedly told Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.","So when our time there was over, we left and started on our way, but they all, together with the women and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed","and said good-bye to one another. Then we went aboard the ship, and they returned to their homes.","We then completed the voyage from Tyre and arrived at  Ptol·e·maʹis, and we greeted the brothers and stayed one day with them.","The next day we left and came to Caes·a·reʹa, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelizer, who was one of the seven men, and we stayed with him.","This man had four unmarried  daughters who prophesied.","But after we had stayed there for quite a number of days, a prophet named Agʹa·bus came down from Ju·deʹa.","And he came to us and took Paul’s belt and tied his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the holy spirit, ‘The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the Jews in Jerusalem, and they will give him into the hands of people of the nations.’”","Now when we heard this, both we and those who were there began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.","Then Paul answered: “What are you doing by weeping and trying to weaken my resolve?  Rest assured, I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”","When he would not be dissuaded, we stopped objecting  and said: “Let the will of Jehovah  take place.”","Now after these days we prepared for the journey and started on our way to Jerusalem.","Some of the disciples from Caes·a·reʹa also went with us, taking us to Mnaʹson of Cyʹprus, an early disciple at whose home we were to be guests.","When we got to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.","But on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.","And he greeted them and began giving a detailed account of the things God did among the nations through his ministry.","After hearing this, they began to glorify God, but they said to him: “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law.","But they have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations an apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to follow the customary practices.","What, then, is to be done about it? They are certainly going to hear that you have arrived.","So do what we tell you: We have four men who have put themselves under a vow.","Take these men with you and cleanse yourself ceremonially together with them and take care of their expenses, so that they may have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you, but that you are walking orderly and you are also keeping the Law.","As for the believers from among the nations, we have sent them our decision in writing that they should keep away from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood, from what is strangled,  and from sexual immorality.”","Then Paul took the men the next day and cleansed himself ceremonially along with them, and he went into the temple to give notice of when the days for the ceremonial cleansing would be completed and the offering should be presented for each one of them.","Now when the seven days were about to end, the Jews from Asia, on seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and they seized him,","shouting: “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our Law and this place. And what is more, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”","For they had previously seen Trophʹi·mus the E·pheʹsian in the city with him, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.","The whole city was in an uproar, and the people came running together and seized Paul and dragged him outside the temple, and immediately the doors were closed.","While they were trying to kill him, word reached the commander of the army unit that all Jerusalem was in confusion;","and he immediately took soldiers and army officers and ran down to them. When they caught sight of the military commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.","Then the military commander came near and took him into custody and ordered that he be bound with two chains; then he inquired who he was and what he had done.","But some in the crowd began shouting out one thing, and others something else. So being unable himself to learn anything for certain because of the disturbance, he commanded him to be brought to the soldiers’ quarters.","But when he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,","for a crowd of the people kept following, crying out: “Do away with him!”","As he was about to be led into the soldiers’ quarters, Paul said to the military commander: “Am I allowed to say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek?","Are you not, then, the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a sedition and led the 4,000 dagger men out into the wilderness?”","Then Paul said: “I am, in fact, a Jew, of Tarsus in Ci·liʹcia, a citizen of no obscure city. So I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.”","After he gave permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned with his hand to the people. When a great silence fell, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:"],["“Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now.”","Well, when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent, and he said:","“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Ci·liʹcia, but educated in this city at the feet of Ga·maʹli·el, instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral Law, and zealous for God just as all of you are this day.","I persecuted this Way to the point of death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women,","as the high priest and all the assembly of elders can bear witness. From them I also obtained letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.","“But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus, about midday, suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me,","and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’","I answered: ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me: ‘I am Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ, whom you are persecuting.’","Now the men who were  with me did see the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.","At that I said: ‘What should I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me: ‘Rise, go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do.’","But since I could not see anything because of the glory of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me.","“Then a man named An·a·niʹas, a devout man according to the Law, well-reported-on by all the Jews living there,","came to me. He stood by me and said to me: ‘Saul, brother, regain your sight!’ And that very moment I looked up and saw him.","He said: ‘The God of our forefathers has chosen you to come to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear the voice of his mouth,","because you are to be a witness for him to all men of the things you have seen and heard.","And now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized, and wash your sins away by your calling on his name.’","“But when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance","and saw him saying to me: ‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your witness concerning me.’","And I said: ‘Lord, they themselves well know that I used to imprison and flog in one synagogue after another those believing in you;","and when the blood of Stephen your witness was being spilled, I was standing by and approving and guarding the outer garments of those doing away with him.’","And yet he said to me: ‘Go, because I will send you out to nations far away.’”","Now they kept listening to him down to this word. Then they raised their voices, saying: “Take such a man away from the earth, for he is not fit to live!”","Because they were crying out, throwing their outer garments about, and tossing dust into the air,","the military commander ordered Paul to be brought into the soldiers’ quarters and said that he should be interrogated under scourging, so that he could learn exactly why they were shouting against Paul this way.","But when they had stretched him out for the whipping, Paul said to the army officer standing there: “Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman  who has not been condemned?”","Well, when the army officer heard this, he went to the military commander and reported it, saying: “What are you intending to do? For this man is a Roman.”","So the military commander approached and said to him: “Tell me, are you a Roman?” He said: “Yes.”","The military commander responded: “I purchased these rights as a citizen for a large sum of money.” Paul said: “But I have them by birth.”","Immediately, therefore, the men who were about to interrogate him under torture backed away from him; and the military commander became afraid when he realized that he was a Roman and that he had bound him in chains.","So the next day, because he wanted to know for sure just why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanʹhe·drin to assemble. He then brought Paul down and had him stand among them."],["Looking intently at the Sanʹhe·drin, Paul said: “Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with a perfectly clear conscience down to this day.”","At this the high priest An·a·niʹas ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.","Then Paul said to him: “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. Do you sit to judge me according to the Law and at the same time violate the Law by commanding me to be struck?”","Those standing by said: “Are you insulting the high priest of God?”","And Paul said: “Brothers, I did not know he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.’”","Now Paul, knowing that the one part was made up of Sadducees but the other of Pharisees, cried out in the Sanʹhe·drin: “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Over the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am being judged.”","Because he said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was split.","For the Sadducees say that there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees accept  them all.","So a great uproar broke out, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees rose and began arguing fiercely, saying: “We find nothing wrong in this man, but if a spirit or an angel spoke to him—.”","Now when the dissension grew great, the military commander feared that Paul would be torn apart by them, and he commanded the soldiers to go down and snatch him from their midst and bring him into the soldiers’ quarters.","But the following night the Lord stood by him and said: “Take courage! For just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.”","When it became day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.","There were more than 40 men who formed this oath-bound conspiracy.","These men went to the chief priests and the elders and said: “We have solemnly bound ourselves with a curse  not to eat anything at all until we have killed Paul.","So now you together with the Sanʹhe·drin should inform the military commander that he should bring him down to you as though you want to examine his case more thoroughly. But before he gets near, we will be ready to do away with him.”","However, the son of Paul’s sister heard of the ambush they were planning, and he entered the soldiers’ quarters and reported it to Paul.","Paul then called one of the army officers to him and said: “Take this young man to the military commander, for he has something to report to him.”","So he brought him and led him to the military commander and said: “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”","The military commander took him by the hand and withdrew privately and asked him: “What do you have to report to me?”","He said: “The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanʹhe·drin tomorrow, as though they intend to learn more details about his case.","But  do not let them persuade you, for more than 40 of their men are waiting to ambush him, and they have bound themselves with a curse  neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him; and they are now ready, waiting for the promise from you.”","So the military commander let the young man go, after ordering him: “Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of this.”","And he summoned two of the army officers and said: “Get 200 soldiers ready to march clear to Caes·a·reʹa, also 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen, at the third hour of the night.","Also, provide horses for Paul to ride, to take him safely to Felix the governor.”","And he wrote a letter with this content:","“Claudius Lysʹi·as to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings!","This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but I came quickly with my soldiers and rescued him, because I learned that he is a Roman.","And wanting to find out the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanʹhe·drin.","I found him to be accused about questions of their Law, but not charged with a single thing deserving of death or prison bonds.","But because a plot against the man has been made known to me, I am at once sending him to you and ordering the accusers to speak against him before you.”","So these soldiers took Paul according to their orders and brought him by night to An·tipʹa·tris.","The next day they permitted the horsemen to go on with him, but they returned to the soldiers’ quarters.","The horsemen entered Caes·a·reʹa and delivered the letter to the governor and also presented Paul to him.","So he read it and asked what province he was from and learned that he was from Ci·liʹcia.","“I will give you a thorough hearing,” he said, “when your accusers arrive.” And he commanded that he be kept under guard in Herod’s palace."],["Five days later the high priest An·a·niʹas came down with some elders and a public speaker  named Ter·tulʹlus, and they presented their case against Paul to the governor.","When he was called, Ter·tulʹlus started accusing him, saying:","at all times and also in all places we acknowledge this, Your Excellency Felix, with the greatest thankfulness.","But that I may not detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your kindness.","For we have found this man to be a pest,  stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and he is a spearhead of the sect of the Naz·a·renesʹ.","He also tried to profane the temple, so we seized him.","——","When you examine him yourself, you will find out about all these things of which we are accusing him.”","With that the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were true.","When the governor nodded to Paul to speak, he answered:","As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than 12 days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem;","and they found me neither arguing with anyone in the temple nor stirring up a mob, either in the synagogues or throughout the city.","Nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of right now.","But I do admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets.","And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.","Because of this I always strive to maintain a clear  conscience before God and men.","Now after quite a number of years, I arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation and to make offerings.","While I was caring for these matters, they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple, but not with a crowd or causing a disturbance. But there were some Jews from the province of Asia","who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me.","Or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanʹhe·drin,","except for this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before you!’”","However, Felix, knowing quite well the facts concerning this Way, began to put them off and say: “Whenever Lysʹi·as the military commander comes down, I will decide these matters involving you.”","And he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom, and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs.","Some days later Felix came with Dru·silʹla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about the belief in Christ Jesus.","But as Paul talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and answered: “Go away for now, but when I have an opportunity I will send for you again.”","At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him money. For that reason, he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him.","But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, he left Paul in custody."],["Therefore Festus, after arriving in the province and taking charge, went up three days later to Jerusalem from Caes·a·reʹa.","And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews gave him information against Paul. So they began to beg Festus","as a favor  to send for Paul to come to Jerusalem. But they were planning to ambush Paul and kill him along the road.","However, Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in Caes·a·reʹa and that he himself was about to go back there shortly.","“So let those who are in power among you,” he said, “come down with me and accuse him if, indeed, the man has done something wrong.”","So when he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caes·a·reʹa, and the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought in.","When he came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many serious charges that they were unable to prove.","But Paul said in defense: “Neither against the Law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I committed any sin.”","Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, said in reply to Paul: “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there concerning these things?”","But Paul said: “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, of which you are also becoming well-aware.","If I am really a wrongdoer and have committed anything deserving of death, I do not beg off from dying; but if there is no substance to the accusations these men have made against me, no man has the right to hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to Caesar!”","Then Festus, after speaking with the assembly of counselors, replied: “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you will go.”","After some days had passed, A·gripʹpa the king and Bernice arrived in Caes·a·reʹa for a courtesy visit to Festus.","Since they were spending a number of days there, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king, saying:","and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought information about him, asking for a judgment of condemnation against him.","But I replied to them that it is not Roman procedure to hand any man over as a favor before the accused man meets his accusers face-to-face and gets a chance to speak in his defense concerning the complaint.","So when they arrived here, I did not delay, but the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.","Taking the stand, the accusers did not charge him with any of the wicked things I had expected concerning him.","They simply had certain disputes with him concerning their own worship of the deity  and concerning a man named Jesus, who was dead but who Paul kept asserting was alive.","Being at a loss as to how to handle this dispute, I asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these matters.","But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision by the August One,  I commanded him to be held until I should send him on to Caesar.”","A·gripʹpa then said to Festus: “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”","So the next day A·gripʹpa and Bernice came with much pompous show and entered the audience chamber together with military commanders as well as the prominent men in the city; and when Festus gave the command, Paul was brought in.","And Festus said: “King A·gripʹpa and all you who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish populace have petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to  live any longer.","But I perceived that he had done nothing deserving of death. So when this man himself appealed to the August One, I decided to send him.","But I have nothing certain to write about him to my Lord. So I brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King A·gripʹpa, so that after the judicial examination has taken place, I might have something to write.","For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to indicate the charges against him.”"],["A·gripʹpa said to Paul: “You are permitted to speak in your own behalf.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to say in his defense:","“Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King A·gripʹpa, I consider myself happy that it is before you I am to make my defense this day,","especially because you are an expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among the Jews. Therefore, I beg you to hear me patiently.","“Indeed, the manner of life I led from youth up among my people  and in Jerusalem is well-known by all the Jews","who were previously acquainted with me, if they would be willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our form of worship, I lived as a Pharisee.","But now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to our forefathers, I stand on trial;","this is the same promise our 12 tribes are hoping to see fulfilled by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day. Concerning this hope I am accused by Jews, O King.","“Why is it considered  unbelievable among you that God raises up the dead?","I, for one, was convinced that I should commit many acts of opposition against the name of Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ.","This is exactly what I did in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the holy ones in prisons, for I had received authority from the chief priests; and when they were to be executed, I cast my vote against them.","By punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to recant; and since I was extremely furious with them, I went so far as to persecute them even in outlying cities.","“While doing this as I was traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,","I saw at midday on the road, O King, a light beyond the brilliance of the sun flash from heaven around me and around those traveling with me.","And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? To keep kicking against the goads  makes it hard for you.’","But I said: ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said: ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.","But rise and stand on your feet. This is why I have appeared to you, to choose you as a servant and a witness both of things you have seen and things I will make you see respecting me.","And I will rescue you from this people and from the nations, to whom I am sending you","to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.’","“Therefore, King A·gripʹpa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision,","but to those in Damascus first and then to those in Jerusalem, and over all the country of Ju·deʹa, and also to the nations, I was bringing the message that they should repent and turn to God by doing works that befit repentance.","This is why the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.","However, because I have experienced the help that is from God, I continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great, saying nothing except what the Prophets as well as Moses stated was going to take place—","that the Christ was to suffer and that as the first to be resurrected from the dead, he was going to proclaim light both to this people and to the nations.”","Now as Paul was saying these things in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice: “You are going out of your mind, Paul! Great learning is driving you out of your mind!”","But Paul said: “I am not going out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus, but I am speaking words of truth and of a sound mind.","For a fact, the king to whom I am speaking so freely well knows about these things; I am convinced that not one of these things escapes his notice, for none of this has been done in a corner.","Do you, King A·gripʹpa, believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.”","But A·gripʹpa said to Paul: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.”","At this Paul said: “I wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I am, with the exception of these prison bonds.”","Then the king rose and so did the governor and Bernice and the men seated with them.","But as they were leaving, they began saying to one another: “This man is doing nothing deserving of death or prison bonds.”","A·gripʹpa then said to Festus: “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”"],["Now as it was decided for us to sail away to Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to an army officer named Julius, of the unit of Au·gusʹtus.","Going aboard a ship from Ad·ra·mytʹti·um that was about to sail to ports along the coast of the province of Asia, we set sail; Ar·is·tarʹchus, a Mac·e·doʹni·an from Thes·sa·lo·niʹca, was with us.","The next day we landed at Siʹdon, and Julius treated Paul with kindness  and permitted him to go to his friends and enjoy their care.","And putting out to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyʹprus, because the winds were against us.","Then we navigated through the open sea along Ci·liʹcia and Pam·phylʹi·a and put into port at Myʹra in Lyʹci·a.","There the army officer found a ship from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy, and he made us board it.","Then after sailing on slowly quite a number of days, we came to Cniʹdus with difficulty. Because the wind did not let us make headway, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Sal·moʹne.","And sailing with difficulty along the coast, we came to a place called Fair Havens, which was near the city of La·seʹa.","A considerable time had passed and by now it was hazardous to navigate, because even the fast of Atonement Day  was already over, so Paul made a recommendation","to them: “Men, I can see that this voyage is going to result in damage and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives.”","However, the army officer listened to the pilot and the shipowner rather than to what Paul was saying.","Since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, the majority advised setting sail from there to see if they could somehow make it to spend the winter in Phoenix, a harbor of Crete that opens toward the northeast and toward the southeast.","When the south wind blew softly, they thought they had achieved their purpose, and they lifted anchor and began sailing along Crete close to the shore.","After a short time, however, a violent wind called Eu·ro·aqʹui·lo  rushed down on it.","As the ship was violently seized and was not able to keep its head against the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.","Then we ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauʹda, and yet we were hardly able to get the skiff  at the stern of the ship under control.","But after hoisting it aboard, they used supports to undergird the ship, and fearing that they would run aground on the Syrʹtis,  they lowered the gear and so were driven along.","Because we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to lighten the ship the following day.","And on the third day, they threw away the tackling of the ship with their own hands.","When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent  storm was battering us, all hope of our being saved finally began to fade.","After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up in their midst and said: “Men, you certainly should have taken my advice and not have put out to sea from Crete and as a result suffered this damage and loss.","Still, I now urge you to take courage, for not one  of you will be lost, only the ship will.","This night an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I render sacred service stood by me","and said: ‘Have no fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and look! God has granted to you all those sailing with you.’","So take courage, men, for I believe God that it will be exactly as I was told.","However, we must be cast ashore on some island.”","Now when the 14th night fell and we were being tossed about on the Sea of Aʹdri·a, at midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were getting near to some land.","They sounded the depth and found it 20 fathoms,  so they proceeded a short distance and again made a sounding and found it 15 fathoms.","And fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they cast out four anchors from the stern and began wishing for it to become day.","But when the sailors began trying to escape from the ship and were lowering the skiff into the sea under the pretense of intending to let down anchors from the bow,","Paul said to the army officer and the soldiers: “Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.”","Then the  soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.","Now close to daybreak, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying: “Today is the 14th day you have been waiting anxiously, and you have gone without taking any food at all.","So I encourage you to eat some food; this is in the interests of your safety, for not a hair of the head of any one of you will perish.”","After he said this, he took bread, gave thanks to God before them all, broke it, and started eating.","So they all took courage and began taking some food themselves.","In all we were 276 persons  in the ship.","When they had eaten enough food to be satisfied, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard into the sea.","When daylight came, they could not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach and were determined to beach the ship there if they could.","So they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudder oars; and after hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.","When they struck a shoal washed on each side by the sea, they ran the ship aground and the bow got stuck and stayed immovable, but the stern began to be violently broken to pieces by the waves.","At this the soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that no one might swim away and escape.","But the army officer was determined to bring Paul safely through and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He commanded those able to swim to jump into the sea and make it to land first,","and the rest were to follow, some on planks and some on pieces of the ship. So all were brought safely to land."],["After we made it to safety, we learned that the island was called Malta.","And the foreign-speaking people  showed us extraordinary kindness.  They kindled a fire and received all of us kindly because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.","But when Paul collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.","When the foreign-speaking people caught sight of the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another: “Surely this man is a murderer, and although he made it to safety from the sea, Justice  did not permit him to keep on living.”","However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.","But they were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to drop dead. After they waited for a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him, they changed their mind and began saying he was a god.","Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the principal man of the island, whose name was Pubʹli·us, and he welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.","It so happened that the father of Pubʹli·us was lying in bed sick with fever and dysentery, and Paul went in to him and prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.","After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who were sick also began to come to him and be cured.","They also honored us with many gifts, and when we  were setting sail, they loaded us up with whatever we needed.","Three months later we set sail in a ship with the figurehead “Sons of Zeus.” The ship was from Alexandria and had wintered in the island.","Putting into port at Syracuse, we remained there for three days;","from there we went along and arrived at Rheʹgi·um. A day later a south wind sprang up and we made it into Pu·teʹo·li on the second day.","Here we found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days, and so we went toward Rome.","From there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came as far as the Marketplace of Apʹpi·us and Three Taverns to meet us. On catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.","When finally we entered Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.","However, three days later he called together the principal men of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them: “Men, brothers, although I had done nothing contrary to the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.","And after making an examination, they wanted to release me, for there were no grounds for putting me to death.","But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, but not because I had any accusation to make against my nation.","So for this reason I asked to see and speak to you, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me.”","They said to him: “We have not received letters about you from Ju·deʹa, nor have any of the brothers who came from there reported or spoken anything bad about you.","But we think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.”","They now arranged for a day to meet with him, and they came in even greater numbers to him in his lodging place. And from morning to evening, he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God, to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.","Some began to believe the things he said; others would not believe.","So because they disagreed with one another, they began to leave, and Paul made this one comment:","saying, ‘Go to this people and say: “You will indeed hear but by no means understand, and you will indeed look but by no means see.","For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes, so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back and I heal them.”’","So let it be known to you that this salvation from God has been sent out to the nations; they will certainly listen to it.”","——","So he remained there for an entire two years in his own rented house, and he would kindly receive all those who came to him,","preaching the Kingdom of God to them and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech,  without hindrance."]],"Romans":[["Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus and called to be an apostle, set apart for God’s good news,","which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,","concerning his Son, who came to be from the offspring  of David according to the flesh,","but who with power was declared God’s Son according to the spirit of holiness by means of resurrection from the dead—yes, Jesus Christ our Lord.","Through him we received undeserved kindness and an apostleship with a view to obedience by faith among all the nations respecting his name,","among which nations you also have been called to belong to Jesus Christ—","to all those who are in Rome as God’s beloved ones, called to be holy ones:","First of all, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you, because your faith is talked about throughout the whole world.","For God, to whom I render sacred service with my spirit in connection with the good news about his Son, is my witness of how without ceasing I always mention you in my prayers,","begging that if at all possible I may now at last succeed in coming to you by God’s will.","For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you for you to be made firm;","or, rather, that we may have an interchange of encouragement by one another’s faith, both yours and mine.","But I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that many times I have intended to come to you—but I have been prevented until now—in order that I might acquire some fruitage also among you just as among the rest of the nations.","Both to Greeks and to foreigners,  both to wise and to senseless ones, I am a debtor;","so I am eager to declare the good news also to you there in Rome.","For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.","For in it God’s righteousness is being revealed by faith and for faith, just as it is written: “But the righteous one will live by reason of faith.”","For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way,","because what may be known about God is clearly evident among them, for God made it clear to them.","For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.","For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their senseless hearts became darkened.","Although claiming they were wise, they became foolish","and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed creatures and reptiles.","Therefore, God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, so  that their bodies might be dishonored among them.","They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated  and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen.","That is why God gave them over to disgraceful sexual passion, for their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature;","likewise also the males left the natural use of  the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full penalty,  which was due for their error.","Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God,  God gave them over to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting.","And they were filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed,  and badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice, being whisperers,","backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, schemers of what is harmful,  disobedient to parents,","without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, and merciless.","Although these know full well the righteous decree of God—that those practicing such things are deserving of death—they not only keep on doing them but also approve of those practicing them."],["Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for when you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge practice the same things.","Now we know that God’s judgment is in harmony with truth, against those who practice such things.","But do you suppose, O man, that while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, you will escape the judgment of God?","Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance  and patience, because you do not know that God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance?","But according to your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment.","And he will pay back to each one according to his works:","everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good;","however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and anger.","There will be tribulation and distress on every person  who works what is harmful, on the Jew first and also on the Greek;","but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.","For there is no partiality with God.","For all those who sinned without law will also perish without law; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law.","For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous.","For when people of the nations,  who do not have law, do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves.","They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them, and by  their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused.","This will take place in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind, according to the good news I declare.","If, now, you are a Jew in name and rely on law and take pride in God,","and you know his will and approve of things that are excellent because you are instructed  out of the Law,","and you are convinced that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness,","a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of young children, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law—","do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching, “Do not steal,” do you steal?","You, the one saying, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You, the one abhorring idols, do you rob temples?","You who take pride in law, do you dishonor God by your transgressing of the Law?","For “the name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you,” just as it is written.","Circumcision is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.","If, therefore, an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not?","And the physically uncircumcised person will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who are a transgressor of law despite having its written code and circumcision.","For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision something on the outside, on the flesh.","But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit and not by a written code. That person’s praise comes from God, not from people."],["What, then, is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?","A great deal in every way.

If some lacked faith, will their lack of faith invalidate the faithfulness of God?","Certainly not! But let God be found true, even if every man be found a liar, just as it is written: “That you might be proved righteous in your words and might win when you are being judged.”","However, if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, what are we to say? God is not unjust when he expresses his wrath, is he? (I am speaking in human terms.)","By no means! How, otherwise, will God judge the world?","But if by my lie the truth of God has been made more prominent to his glory, why am I also being judged as a sinner?","And why not say, just as some men falsely claim that we say, “Let us do bad things that good things may come”? The judgment against those men is in harmony with justice.","What then? Are we in a better position? Not at all! For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin;","just as it is written: “There is not a righteous man, not even one;","there is no one who has any insight; there is no one who searches for God.","All men have turned aside, all of them have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, not so much as one.”","“Their throat is an open grave; they have deceived with their tongues.” “Venom of asps is behind their lips.”","“And their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.”","“Their feet are swift to shed blood.”","“Ruin and misery are in their ways,","and they have not known the way of peace.”","“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”","Now we know that all the things the Law says, it addresses to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced and all the world may become accountable to God for punishment.","Therefore, no one  will be declared righteous before him by works of law, for by law comes the accurate knowledge of sin.","But now apart from law God’s righteousness has been revealed, as the Law and the Prophets bear witness,","yes, God’s righteousness through the faith in Jesus Christ, for all those having faith. For there is no distinction.","For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,","and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus.","God presented him as an offering for propitiation  through faith in his blood. This was to demonstrate his own righteousness, because God in his forbearance  was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past.","This was to demonstrate his own righteousness in this present season, so that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man who has faith in Jesus.","Where, then, is the boasting? There is no place for it. Through what law? That of works? No indeed, but through the law of faith.","For we consider that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law.","Or is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of people of the nations? Yes, also of people of the nations.","Since God is one, he will declare circumcised people righteous as a result of faith and uncircumcised people righteous by means of their faith.","Do we, then, abolish law by means of our faith? Not at all! On the contrary, we uphold law."],["That being so, what will we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?","For instance, if Abraham was declared righteous as a result of works, he would have reason to boast, but not with God.","For what does the scripture say? “Abraham put faith in Jehovah,  and it was counted to him as righteousness.”","Now to the man who works, his pay is not counted as an undeserved kindness but as something owed to him.","On the other hand, to the man who does not work but puts faith in the One who declares the ungodly one righteous, his faith is counted as righteousness.","Just as David also speaks of the happiness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:","“Happy are those whose lawless deeds have been pardoned and whose sins have been covered;","happy is the man whose sin Jehovah  will by no means take into account.”","Does this happiness, then, only come to circumcised people or also to uncircumcised people? For we say: “Abraham’s faith was counted to him as righteousness.”","Under what circumstances, then, was it counted as righteousness? When he was circumcised or uncircumcised? He was not yet circumcised but was uncircumcised.","And he received a sign—namely, circumcision—as a seal  of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, so that he might be the father of all those having faith while uncircumcised, in order for righteousness to be counted to them;","and so that he might be a father to circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had while in the uncircumcised state.","For it was not through law that Abraham or his offspring  had the promise that he should be heir of a world, but it was through righteousness by faith.","For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith becomes useless and the promise has been abolished.","In reality the Law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression.","That is why it is through faith, so that it might be according to undeserved kindness, in order for the promise to be sure to all his offspring,  not only to those who adhere to the Law but also to those who adhere to the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.","(This is just as it is written: “I have appointed you a father of many nations.”) This was in the sight of God, in whom he had faith, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are.","Although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said: “So your offspring  will be.”","And although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now as good as dead (since he was about 100 years old), as well as the deadness  of the womb of Sarah.","But because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith; but he became powerful by his faith, giving God glory","and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do.","Therefore, “it was counted to him as righteousness.”","However, the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake only,","but also for our sake, to whom it will be counted, because we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead.","He was handed over for the sake of our trespasses and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous."],["Therefore, now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy  peace  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,","through whom we also have obtained access by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand; and let us rejoice,  based on hope of the glory of God.","Not only that, but let us rejoice  while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance;","endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope,","and the hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given to us.","For, indeed, while we were still weak, Christ died for ungodly men at the appointed time.","For hardly would anyone die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man someone may dare to die.","But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.","Much more, then, since we have now been declared righteous by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath.","For if when we were enemies we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more we will be saved by his life, now that we have become reconciled.","Not only that, but we are also rejoicing in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.","That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.","For sin was in the world before the Law, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law.","Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed, who bears a resemblance to the one who was to come.","But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by one man’s trespass many died, how much more did the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift by the undeserved kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound  to many!","Also, it is not the same with the free gift as with the way things worked through the one man who sinned. For the judgment after one trespass was condemnation, but the gift after many trespasses was a declaration of righteousness.","For if by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king through that one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness rule as kings in life through the one person, Jesus Christ!","So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, so too through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is their being declared righteous for life.","For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous.","Now the Law came on the scene so that trespassing might increase. But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more.","To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasting  life through Jesus Christ our Lord."],["What are we to say then? Should we continue in sin so that undeserved kindness may increase?","Certainly not! Seeing that we died with reference to sin, how can we keep living any longer in it?","Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?","So we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in a newness of life.","If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.","For we know that our old personality was nailed to the stake along with him in order for our sinful body to be made powerless, so that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin.","For the one who has died has been acquitted  from his sin.","Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.","For we know that Christ, now that he has been raised up from the dead, dies no more; death is no longer master over him.","For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin  once for all time, but the life that he lives, he lives with reference to God.","Likewise you, consider yourselves to be dead with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus.","Therefore, do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires.","Neither go on presenting your bodies  to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also your bodies  to God as weapons of righteousness.","For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.","What follows? Are we to commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Certainly not!","Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness?","But thanks to God that although you were once the slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that pattern of teaching to which you were handed over.","Yes, since you were set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.","I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh; for just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness leading to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.","For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as to righteousness.","What, then, was the fruit that you used to produce at that time? Things of which you are now ashamed. For the end of those things is death.","However, now that you were set free from sin and became slaves to God, you are producing your fruit in the way of holiness, and the end is everlasting life.","For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord."],["Can it be that you do not know, brothers, (for I am speaking to those who know law) that the Law is master over a man as long as he lives?","For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.","So, then, while her husband is living, she would be called an adulteress if she became another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man’s.","So, my brothers, you also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ, that you might become another’s, the one who was raised up from the dead, so that we should bear fruit to God.","For when we were living according to the flesh, the sinful passions that were awakened by the Law were at work in our bodies  to produce fruit for death.","But now we have been released from the Law, because we have died to that which restrained us, in order that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit and not in the old sense by the written code.","What, then, are we to say? Is the Law sin? Certainly not! Really, I would not have come to know sin had it not been for the Law. For example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: “You must not covet.”","But sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead.","In fact, I was once alive apart from law. But when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died.","And the commandment that was to lead to life, this I found led to death.","For sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it.","So the Law in itself is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.","Therefore, did what is good result in my death? Certainly not! But sin did, that it might be shown to be sin working out death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become far more sinful.","For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.","For I do not understand what I am doing. For I do not practice what I wish, but I do what I hate.","However, if I do what I do not wish, I agree that the Law is fine.","But now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is the sin that resides in me.","For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for I have the desire to do what is fine but not the ability to carry it out.","For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.","If, then, I do what I do not wish, I am no longer the one carrying it out, but it is the sin dwelling in me.","I find, then, this law in my case: When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.","I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,","but I see in my body  another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my body.","Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?","Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with my flesh to sin’s law."],["Therefore, those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation.","For the law of the spirit that gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.","What the Law was incapable of doing because it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemning sin in the flesh,","so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.","For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit, on the things of the spirit.","For setting the mind on the flesh means death, but setting the mind on the spirit means life and peace;","because setting the mind on the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not in subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be.","So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.","However, you are in harmony, not with the flesh, but with the spirit, if God’s spirit truly dwells in you. But if anyone does not have Christ’s spirit, this person does not belong to him.","But if Christ is in union with you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.","If, now, the spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in you.","So, then, brothers, we are under obligation, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh;","for if you live according to the flesh, you are sure to die; but if you put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, you will live.","For all who are led by God’s spirit are indeed God’s sons.","For you did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out:  “Abba,  Father!”","The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.","If, then, we are children, we are also heirs—heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ—provided we suffer together so that we may also be glorified together.","For I consider that the sufferings of the present time do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us.","For the creation is waiting with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.","For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but through the one who subjected it, on the basis of hope","that the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.","For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.","Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom.","For we were saved in this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for when a man sees a thing, does he hope for it?","But if we hope for what we do not see, we keep eagerly waiting for it with endurance.","In like manner, the spirit also joins in with help for  our weakness; for the problem is that we do not know what we should pray for as we need to, but the spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered  groanings.","But the one who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in harmony with God for the holy ones.","We know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God, those who are the ones called according to his purpose;","because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.","Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous. Finally those whom he declared righteous are the ones he also glorified.","What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who will be against us?","Since he did not even spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, will he not also, along with him, kindly give us all other things?","Who will file accusation against God’s chosen ones? God is the One who declares them righteous.","Who will condemn them? Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, more than that, the one who was raised up, who is at the right hand of God and who also pleads for us.","Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?","Just as it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.”","On the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us.","For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers","nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."],["I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as my conscience bears witness with me in holy spirit,","that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.","For I could wish that I myself were separated from the Christ as the cursed one for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh,","who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the sacred service and the promises.","To them the forefathers belong, and from them the Christ descended according to the flesh. God, who is over all, be praised forever. Amen.","However, it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who descend from Israel are really “Israel.”","Neither are they all children because they are Abraham’s offspring;  rather, “What will be called your offspring  will be through Isaac.”","That is, the children in the flesh are not really the children of God, but the children by the promise are counted as the offspring.","For the word of promise was as follows: “At this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.”","Not only then but also when Re·bekʹah conceived twins from the one man, Isaac our forefather;","for when they had not yet been born and had not practiced anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose respecting the choosing might continue dependent, not on works, but on the One who calls,","it was said to her: “The older will be the slave of the younger.”","Just as it is written: “I loved Jacob, but Eʹsau I hated.”","What are we to say, then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not!","For he says to Moses: “I will show mercy to whomever I will show mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I will show compassion.”","So, then, it depends, not on a person’s desire or on his effort,  but on God, who has mercy.","For the scripture says to Pharʹaoh: “For this very reason I have let you remain: to show my power in connection with you and to have my name declared in all the earth.”","So, then, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, but he lets whomever he wishes become obstinate.","You will therefore say to me: “Why does he still find fault? For who has withstood his will?”","But who are you, O man, to be answering back to God? Does the thing molded say to its molder: “Why did you make me this way?”","What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use?","What, then, if God had the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, and he tolerated with much patience vessels of wrath made fit for destruction?","And if this was done to make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,","namely, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, what of it?","It is as he says also in Ho·seʹa: “Those not my people I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not loved, ‘beloved’;","and in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”","Moreover, Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Although the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.","For Jehovah  will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.”","Also, just as Isaiah foretold: “Unless Jehovah  of armies had left an offspring  to us, we should have become just like Sodʹom, and we should have resembled Go·morʹrah.”","What are we to say, then? That people of the nations, although not pursuing righteousness, attained righteousness, the righteousness that results from faith;","but Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to that law.","For what reason? Because they pursued it, not by faith, but as by works. They stumbled over the “stone of stumbling”;","as it is written: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, but the one who rests his faith on it will not be disappointed.”"],["Brothers, the goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are indeed for their salvation.","For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to accurate knowledge.","For because of not knowing  the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.","For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.","For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the Law: “The man who does these things will live by means of them.”","But the righteousness resulting from faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ that is, to bring Christ down,","or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.”","But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart”; that is, “the word” of faith, which we are preaching.","For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved.","For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.","For the scripture says: “No one who rests his faith on him will be disappointed.”","For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. There is the same Lord over all, who is rich  toward all those calling on him.","For “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah  will be saved.”","However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him? How, in turn, will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?","How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent out? Just as it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!”","Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says: “Jehovah,  who has put faith in the thing heard from us?”","So faith follows the thing heard. In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ.","But I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, “into all the earth their sound went out, and to the ends of the inhabited earth their message.”","But I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? First Moses says: “I will incite you to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite you to violent anger through a foolish nation.”","But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I became known to those who were not asking for me.”","But he says regarding Israel: “All day long I have spread out my hands toward a disobedient and obstinate people.”"],["I ask, then, God did not reject his people, did he? By no means! For I too am an Israelite, of the offspring  of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.","God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. Do you not know what the scripture says in connection with E·liʹjah, as he pleads with God against Israel?","“Jehovah,  they have killed your prophets, they have dug up your altars, and I alone am left, and now they are trying to take my life.”","Yet, what does the divine pronouncement say to him? “I have left for myself 7,000 men who have not bent the knee to Baʹal.”","So in the same way, at the present time also, there is a remnant according  to a choosing through undeserved kindness.","Now if it is by undeserved kindness, it is no longer through works; otherwise, the undeserved kindness would no longer be undeserved kindness.","What, then? The very thing Israel is earnestly seeking he did not obtain, but the ones chosen obtained it. The rest had their senses dulled,","just as it is written: “God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, down to this very day.”","Also, David says: “Let their table become a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution for them.","Let their eyes become darkened so that they cannot see, and always make them bend their backs.”","So I ask, They did not stumble and fall completely, did they? Certainly not! But by their false step, there is salvation to people of the nations, to incite them to jealousy.","Now if their false step means riches to the world and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, how much more will their full number mean!","Now I speak to you who are people of the nations. Seeing that I am an apostle to the nations, I glorify  my ministry","to see if I may in some way incite my own people  to jealousy and save some from among them.","For if their being cast away means reconciliation for the world, what will the acceptance of them mean but life from the dead?","Further, if the part of the dough taken as firstfruits is holy, the entire batch is also holy; and if the root is holy, the branches are also.","However, if some of the branches were broken off and you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the richness of the olive’s root,","do not be arrogant toward  the branches. If, though, you are arrogant toward  them, remember that you do not bear the root, but the root bears you.","You will say, then: “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”","That is true! For their lack of faith, they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Do not be haughty, but be in fear.","For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.","Consider, therefore, God’s kindness and severity. There is severity toward those who fell, but toward you there is God’s kindness, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you too will be lopped off.","And they also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them back in.","For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree, how much more will these who are natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!","For I do not want you to be unaware of this sacred secret, brothers, so that you do not become wise in your own eyes: A partial dulling of senses has come upon Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in,","and in this manner all Israel will be saved. Just as it is written: “The deliverer  will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob.","And this is my covenant with them, when I take their sins  away.”","True, with respect to the good news, they are enemies for your sakes; but with respect to God’s choosing, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.","For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret.","For just as you were once disobedient to God but have now been shown mercy because of their disobedience,","so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to you, so that they themselves may also now be shown mercy.","For God has confined all of them together in disobedience so that he might show all of them mercy.","O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and beyond tracing out his ways are!","For “who has come to know Jehovah’s  mind, or who has become his adviser?”","Or, “who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?”","Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen."],["Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.","And stop being molded by this system of things,  but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.","For through the undeserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think, but to think so as to have a sound mind, each one as God has given  to him a measure of faith.","For just as we have in one body many members, but the members do not all have the same function,","so we, although many, are one body in union with Christ, but individually we are members belonging to one another.","Since, then, we have gifts that differ according to the undeserved kindness given to us, if it is of prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith;","or if it is a ministry, let us be at this ministry; or the one who teaches, let him be at his teaching;","or the one who encourages,  let him give encouragement;  the one who distributes,  let him do it liberally; the one who presides,  let him do it diligently;  the one who shows mercy, let him do it cheerfully.","Let your love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is wicked; cling to what is good.","In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another, take the lead.","Be industrious,  not lazy.  Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.","Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer.","Share with the holy ones according to their needs.

Paul was not executed on the stake for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?","I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crisʹpus and Gaʹius,","so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.","Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephʹa·nas. As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anyone  else.","For Christ sent me, not to baptize, but to declare the good news; and not with wisdom of speech,  so that the torture stake  of the Christ should not be made useless.","For the speech about the torture stake  is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is God’s power.","For it is written: “I will make the wisdom of the wise men perish, and the intelligence of the intellectuals I will reject.”","Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe?  Where is the debater of this system of things?  Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish?","For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not get to know God through its wisdom, God was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing.","For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks look for wisdom;","but we preach Christ executed on the stake, to the Jews a cause for stumbling but to the nations foolishness.","However, to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.","Because a foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men.","For you see his calling of you, brothers, that there are not many wise in a fleshly way,  not many powerful, not many of noble birth,","but God chose the foolish things of the world to put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world to put the strong things to shame;","and God chose the insignificant things of the world and the things looked down on, the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,","so that no one  might boast in the sight of God.","But it is due to him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom,","so that it may be just as it is written: “The one who boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.”"],["So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with extravagant speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you.","For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and him executed on the stake.","And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling;","and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of spirit and power,","so that your faith might be, not in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.","Now we speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this system of things  nor that of the rulers of this system of things, who are to come to nothing.","But we speak God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory.","It is this wisdom that none of the rulers of this system of things  came to know, for if they had known it, they would not have executed  the glorious Lord.","But just as it is written: “Eye has not  seen and ear has not heard, nor have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him.”","For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.","For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So, too, no one has come to know the things of God except the spirit of God.","Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from God, so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God.","These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, as we explain  spiritual matters with spiritual words.","But a physical man does not accept  the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually.","However, the spiritual man examines all things, but he himself is not examined by any man.","For “who has come to know the mind of Jehovah,  so that he may instruct him?” But we do have the mind of Christ."],["So, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshly men, as to infants in Christ.","I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough.

Yes, what is Paul?

He will bring the secret things of darkness to light and make known the intentions of the hearts, and then each one will receive his praise from God.","Now, brothers, these things I have applied  to myself and A·polʹlos for your good, that through us you may learn the rule: “Do not go beyond the things that are written,” so that you may not be puffed up with pride, favoring one against the other.","For who makes you different from another?

Have you begun ruling as kings without us? I really wish that you had begun ruling as kings, so that we also might rule with you as kings.","For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men condemned to death, because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men.","We are fools because of Christ, but you are discreet in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are held in honor, but we in dishonor.","Down to this very hour we continue to hunger and thirst and to be poorly clothed  and to be beaten  and to be homeless","and to toil, working with our own hands.

Stop seeking a release. Are you freed from a wife? Stop seeking a wife.","But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin. And if a virgin married, such a person would commit no sin.

The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord,  how he may gain the Lord’s approval.","But the married man is anxious for the things of the world, how he may gain the approval of his wife,","and he is divided. Further, the unmarried woman, as well as the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit. However, the married woman is anxious for the things of the world, how she may gain the approval of her husband.","But I am saying this for your personal advantage, not to restrict  you, but to move you to what is appropriate and to constant devotion to the Lord without distraction.","But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly by remaining unmarried,  and if he is past the bloom of youth, then this is what should take place: Let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.","But if anyone stands settled in his heart and has no necessity, but has authority over his own will and has made the decision in his own heart to remain unmarried,  he will do well.","So also, whoever marries  does well, but whoever does not marry will do better.","A wife is bound as long as her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep in death, she is free to be married to whomever she wants, only in the Lord.","But in my opinion, she is happier if she remains as she is; and I certainly think I also have God’s spirit."],["Now concerning food offered to idols: We know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.","If anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know it as he should know it.","But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.","Now concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.","For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,”","there is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and we through him.","However, not all have this knowledge. But some, because of their former association with the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.","But food will not bring us nearer to God; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor better off if we eat.","But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.","For if anyone should see you who have knowledge having a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating food offered to idols?","So by your knowledge the man who is weak is being ruined, your brother for whose sake Christ died.","When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.","That is why if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat at all, so that I will not make my brother stumble."],["Am I not free?

Or does not the Law also say these things?","For it is written in the Law of Moses: “You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain.” Is it bulls that God is concerned about?","Or is it actually for our sakes that he says it? It was really written for our sakes, because the man who plows and the man who threshes ought to do so in the hope of receiving a share.","If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material support from you?","If other men have this rightful claim over you, do we not have it much more so?

Indeed, I have not written these things so that this would be done for me, for it would be better to die than—no man will take away my grounds for boasting!","Now if I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast, for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe to me if I do not declare the good news!","If I do this willingly, I have a reward; but even if I do it against my will, I still have a stewardship entrusted to me.","What, then, is my reward? That when I declare the good news, I may offer the good news without cost, to avoid abusing my authority  in the good news.","For though I am free from all people, I have made myself the slave to all, so that I may gain as many people as possible.","To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews; to those under law I became as under law, though I myself am not under law, in order to gain those under law.","To those without law I became as without law, although I am not without law toward God but under law toward Christ, in order to gain those without law.","To the weak I became weak, in order to gain the weak.

It is sown in corruption; it is raised up in incorruption.","It is sown in dishonor; it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised up in power.","It is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual body.

O our Lord, come!","May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with you.","May my love be with all of you in union with Christ Jesus."]],"2 Corinthians":[["Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will, and Timothy our brother, to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, including all the holy ones who are in all A·chaʹia:","May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort,","who comforts  us in all our trials  so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial  with the comfort that we receive from God.","For just as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so the comfort we receive through the Christ also abounds.","Now if we face trials,  it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are being comforted, it is for your comfort, which acts to help you to endure the same sufferings that we also suffer.","And our hope for you is unwavering, knowing as we do that just as you share in the sufferings, so you will also share in the comfort.","For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the  tribulation we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength, so that we were very uncertain even of our lives.","In fact, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. This was so that we would trust, not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead.","From such a great risk of death he did rescue us and will rescue us, and our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us.","You also can help us by your supplication for us, in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many.","For the thing we boast of is this, our conscience bears witness that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but with God’s undeserved kindness.","For we are really not writing you about anything except what you can read  and understand, and I hope you will continue to understand these things fully,","just as you have also understood to an extent that we are a cause for you to boast, just as you will also be for us in the day of our Lord Jesus.","So with this confidence, I was intending to come first to you, so that you might have a second occasion for joy;","for I intended to visit you on my way to Mac·e·doʹni·a, to return to you from Mac·e·doʹni·a, and then to have you send me off to Ju·deʹa.","Well, when I had such an intention, I did not view the matter lightly, did I? Or do I purpose things in a fleshly way, so that I am saying “Yes, yes” and then “No, no”?","But God can be relied on that what we say to you is not “yes” and yet “no.”","For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, that is, through me and Sil·vaʹnus  and Timothy, did not become “yes” and yet “no,” but “yes” has become “yes” in his case.","For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become “yes” by means of him. Therefore, also through him is the “Amen” said to God, which brings him glory through us.","But the one who guarantees that you and we belong to Christ and the one who anointed us is God.","He has also put his seal on us and has given us the token of what is to come,  that is, the spirit, in our hearts.","Now I call on God as a witness against me  that it is to spare you that I have not yet come to Corinth.","Not that we are the masters over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, for it is by your faith that you are standing."],["For I have made up my mind not to come to you again in sadness.","For if I make you sad, who will be there to cheer me up except the one I saddened?","I wrote what I did, so that when I come I may not be saddened by those over whom I ought to rejoice, because I have confidence that what brings me joy brings all of you the same joy.","For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart I wrote you with many tears, not to sadden you, but to let you know the depth of love I have for you.","Now if anyone has caused sadness, he has saddened, not me, but all of you to an extent—not to be too harsh in what I say.","This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man;","now you should instead kindly forgive and comfort him, so that he may not be overwhelmed  by excessive sadness.","I therefore exhort you to confirm your love for him.","For this is also why I wrote to you: to determine whether you would give proof of your obedience in all things.","If you forgive anyone for anything, I do also. In fact, whatever I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) has been for your sake in Christ’s sight,","so that we may not be overreached  by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his designs.","Now when I arrived in Troʹas to declare the good news about the Christ and a door was opened to me in the Lord,","my spirit felt no relief because of not finding Titus my brother. So I said good-bye to them and departed for Mac·e·doʹni·a.","But thanks be to God, who always leads us in a triumphal procession in company with the Christ and through us spreads  the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place!","For to God we are a sweet fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;","to the latter ones an odor  of death leading to death, to the former ones a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequately qualified for these things?","We are, for we are not peddlers of  the word of God as many men are, but we speak in all sincerity as sent from God, yes, in the sight of God and in company with Christ."],["Are we starting to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some men, letters of recommendation to you or from you?","You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind.","For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers, inscribed not with ink but with the spirit of a living God, not on stone tablets but on fleshly tablets, on hearts.","We have this sort of confidence toward God through the Christ.","Not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us, but our being adequately qualified comes from God,","who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not of a written code, but of spirit; for the written code condemns to death, but the spirit makes alive.","Now if the code that administers death and that was engraved in letters on stones came with such glory that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, a glory that was to be done away with,","why should the administering of the spirit not be with even greater glory?","For if the code administering condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious would be the administering of righteousness!","In fact, even what had once been made glorious has been stripped of glory because of the glory that excels it.","For if what was to be done away with was brought in with glory, how much greater would be the glory of what remains!","Since we have such a hope, we are using great freeness of speech,","and not doing what Moses did when he would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of what was to be done away with.","But their minds were dulled. For to this present day, the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read, because it is taken away only by means of Christ.","In fact, to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their hearts.","But when one turns to Jehovah,  the veil is taken away.","Now Jehovah  is the Spirit, and where the spirit of Jehovah  is, there is freedom.","And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah,  are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another,  exactly as it is done by Jehovah  the Spirit."],["Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up.","But we have renounced the shameful, underhanded things, not walking with cunning or adulterating the word of God; but by making the truth manifest, we recommend ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of God.","If, in fact, the good news we declare is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing,","among whom the god of this system of things  has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination  of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.","For we are preaching, not about ourselves, but about Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.","For God is the one who said: “Let the light shine out of darkness,” and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.","However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels,  so that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not from us.","We are hard-pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out;","we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed.","Always we endure in our body the death-dealing treatment that Jesus suffered, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our body.","For we who live are ever being brought face-to-face with death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh.","So death is at work in us, but life in you.","Now because we have the same spirit of faith as that of which it is written: “I exercised faith, therefore I spoke”; we too exercise faith and therefore we speak,","knowing that the One who raised Jesus up will raise us up also with Jesus and will present us together with you.","For all these things are for your sake, so that the increase of the undeserved kindness should abound even more because many more are offering thanksgiving to the glory of God.","Therefore, we do not give up, but even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside is  being renewed from day to day.","For though the tribulation  is momentary and light, it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness  and is everlasting;","while we keep our eyes, not on the things seen, but on the things unseen. For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting."],["For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, should be torn down,  we are to have a building from God, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens.","For in this house  we do indeed groan, earnestly desiring to put on the one for us  from heaven,","so that when we do put it on, we will not be found naked.","In fact, we who are in this tent groan, being weighed down, because we do not want to put this one off, but we want to put the other on, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.","Now the one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the spirit as a token of what is to come.","So we are always of good courage and know that while we have our home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,","for we are walking by faith, not by sight.","But we are of good courage and would prefer to be absent from the body and to make our home with the Lord.","So whether at home with him or absent from him, we make it our aim to be acceptable to him.","For we must all appear  before the judgment seat of the Christ, so that each one may be repaid according to the things he has practiced while in the body, whether good or bad.","Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we keep persuading men, but we are well-known  to God. However, I hope that we are well-known  also to your consciences.","We are not recommending ourselves to you again but giving you an incentive to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast over the outward appearance but not over what is in the heart.","For if we were out of our mind, it was for God; if we are sound in mind, it is for you.","For the love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have concluded, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died.","And he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.","So from now on we know no man from a fleshly viewpoint. Even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, we certainly no longer know him in that way.","Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away; look! new things have come into existence.","But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation,","namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, not counting their offenses against them, and he entrusted to us the message of the reconciliation.","Therefore, we are ambassadors substituting for Christ,  as though God were making an appeal through us. As substitutes for Christ, we beg: “Become reconciled to God.”","The one who did not know sin, he made to be sin  for us, so that by means of him we might become God’s righteousness."],["Working together with him, we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.","For he says: “In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.” Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.","In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, so that no fault may be found with our ministry;","but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by times of need, by difficulties,","by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by hard work, by sleepless nights, by times without food;","by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy,","by truthful speech, by God’s power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right hand  and in the left,","through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report. We are regarded as deceivers and yet we are truthful,","as unknown and yet we are recognized, as dying  and yet look! we live, as punished  and yet not handed over to death,","as sorrowing but ever rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.","We have opened our mouth to speak  to you, Corinthians, and we have opened wide our heart.","We are not restricted in  our affections for you, but you are restricted in your own tender affections for us.","So in response—I speak as to my children—you too open your hearts wide.","Do not become unevenly yoked  with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?","Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Beʹli·al?  Or what does a believer  share in common  with an unbeliever?","And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols? For we are a temple of a living God; just as God said: “I will reside among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”","“‘Therefore, get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah,  ‘and quit touching the unclean thing’”; “‘and I will take you in.’”","“‘And I will become a father to you, and you will become sons and daughters to me,’ says Jehovah,  the Almighty.”"],["Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.","Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one,  we have taken advantage of no one.","I do not say this to condemn you. For I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.","I have great freeness of speech toward you. I have great boasting in regard to you. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.","In fact, when we arrived in Mac·e·doʹni·a, our bodies  got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every way—there were fights on the outside, fears within.","But God, who comforts those who are downhearted, comforted us by the presence of Titus;","and not only by his presence but also by the comfort he received because of you, as he reported back to us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, and your earnest concern  for me; so I rejoiced even more.","For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did at first regret it (seeing that the letter saddened you, though only for a little while),","now I rejoice, not because you were just saddened, but because you were saddened into repenting. For you were saddened in a godly way, so that you suffered no harm because of us.","For sadness in a godly way produces repentance leading to salvation, leaving no regret; but the sadness of the world produces death.","For see what a great earnestness your being saddened in a godly way produced in you, yes, clearing of yourselves, yes, indignation, yes, fear, yes, earnest desire, yes, zeal, yes, righting of the wrong! In every respect you demonstrated yourselves to be pure  in this matter.","Although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the one who did the wrong, nor for the one who was wronged, but so that your earnestness for us might be made evident among you in the sight of God.","That is why we have been comforted.","For if I have boasted to him about you, I have not been put to shame; but just as all the things we told you were true, so also our boasting to Titus has proved true.","Also, his tender affections toward you are greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you, how you received him with fear and trembling.","I rejoice that in every way I may have confidence in  you."],["Now we want you to know, brothers, about the undeserved kindness of God that has been granted to the congregations of Mac·e·doʹni·a.","During a great test under affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound.","For it was according to their means, yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means,","while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving, to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones.","And not merely as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through God’s will.","So we encouraged Titus that, just as he had initiated this work among you, he should also complete this same kind giving on your part.","Nevertheless, just as you abound in everything,  in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in our love for you, may you also abound in this kind giving.","I am saying this, not to command you, but to make you aware of the earnestness of others and to test the genuineness of your love.","For you know the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, he became poor for your sake, so that you might become rich through his poverty.","And in this I give my opinion: This is for your benefit, seeing that already a year ago you not only initiated the action but also showed your desire to do it.","So now, also complete what you started to do, so that your readiness to act may be completed according to the means you have available.","For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.","For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you;","but that by means of an equalizing, your surplus at the present time might offset their need, so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency, that there may be an equalizing.","Just as it is written: “The person with much did not have too much, and the person with little did not have too little.”","Now thanks be to God for putting the same earnest concern for you in the heart of Titus,","because he has indeed responded to the encouragement, but being very eager, he is coming to you on his own initiative.","But we are sending along with him the brother whose praise in connection with the good news has spread through all the congregations.","Not only that, but he was also appointed by the congregations to be our traveling companion as we administer this kind gift for the glory of the Lord and in proof of our readiness to assist.","Thus we are avoiding having any man find fault with us in connection with this liberal contribution that we are administering.","For we ‘care for everything honestly, not only in the sight of Jehovah  but also in the sight of men.’","Moreover, we are sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many matters, but now much more diligent on account of his great confidence in you.","If, though, there is any question about Titus, he is my companion  and a fellow worker for your interests; or if there are questions about our brothers, they are apostles of congregations and a glory of Christ.","So demonstrate the proof of your love to them, and show the congregations why we boasted about you."],["Now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones, it is not really necessary for me to write you,","for I know your willingness about which I am boasting to the Mac·e·doʹni·ans, that A·chaʹia has been ready now for a year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them.","But I am sending the brothers, so that our boasting about you might not prove empty in this respect and that you may really be ready, just as I said you would be.","Otherwise, if the Mac·e·doʹni·ans should come with me and find you not ready, we—not to mention you—should be put to shame by our confidence in you.","So I thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to come to you ahead of time and to  get your promised bountiful gift ready in advance, so that this might be ready as a generous gift, and not as something extorted.","But as to this, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.","Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly  or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.","Moreover, God is able to cause all his undeserved kindness to abound toward you so that you are always completely self-sufficient in everything, as well as having plenty for every good work.","(Just as it is written: “He has distributed widely;  he has given to the poor. His righteousness continues forever.”","Now the One who abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest of your righteousness.)","In everything you are being enriched for every sort of generosity, which produces through us an expression of thanks to God;","because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to God.","Through the proof that this relief ministry gives, they glorify God because you are submissive to the good news about the Christ, as you publicly declared, and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all.","And with supplication for you, they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you.","Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift."],["Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you by the mildness and kindness of the Christ, lowly though I am when among you face-to-face, but bold toward you when absent.","I beg that when present, I may not have to be bold and take the strong measures that I expect against some who view us as if we walked in a fleshly manner.","For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh.","For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.","For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ;","and we are prepared to inflict punishment for every disobedience, as soon as your own obedience is complete.","You look at things according to their face value. If anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to Christ, let him reflect again on this fact: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we also.","For even if I should boast a bit too much about the authority that the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I would not be put to shame.","For I do not want to seem as though I were trying to terrify you by my letters.","For they say: “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible.”","Let such a man consider that what we say  by letters when absent, this we will also do  when present.","For we do not dare to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.","However, we will not boast outside our assigned boundaries, but within the boundary of the territory that God measured out to us,  making it reach even as far as you.","Really, we are not overextending ourselves as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to reach as far as you with the good news about the Christ.","No, we are not boasting outside our assigned boundaries about the labors of someone else, but we hope that as your faith continues to increase, what we have done may be made to increase, within our territory. Then we will abound still more,","so that we may declare the good news to the countries beyond you, so as not to boast in what has already been done in someone else’s territory.","“But the one who boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.”","For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved, but the one whom Jehovah  recommends."],["I wish you would put up with me in a little unreasonableness. But, in fact, you are putting up with me!","For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy,  for I personally promised you in marriage to one husband that I might present you as a chaste  virgin to the Christ.","But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity  that are due the Christ.","For as it is, if someone comes and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or you receive a spirit other than what you received, or good news other than what you accepted, you easily put up with him.","For I consider that I have not proved inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing.","But even if I am unskilled in speech, I certainly am not in knowledge; indeed we made it clear to you in every way and in everything.","Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I gladly declared the good news of God to you without cost?","Other congregations I deprived  by accepting provisions  in order to minister to you.","Yet, when I was present with you and I fell into need, I did not become a burden on anyone, for the brothers who came from Mac·e·doʹni·a abundantly supplied my needs. Yes, in every way I kept myself from becoming a burden to you and will continue to do so.","As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, I will not stop this boasting in the regions of A·chaʹia.","For what reason? Because I do not love you? God knows I do.","But what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to eliminate the pretext of those who are wanting a basis  for being found equal to us in the things  about which they boast.","For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.","And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps disguising himself as an angel of light.","It is therefore nothing extraordinary if his  ministers also keep disguising themselves as ministers of righteousness. But their end will be according to their works.","I say again: Let no one think I am unreasonable. But even if you do, then accept me as an unreasonable person, so that I too may boast a little.","What I now say is, not as following the Lord’s example, but as an unreasonable person would, with boastful self-confidence.","Since many are boasting according to the flesh,  I too will boast.","Since you are so “reasonable,” you gladly put up with the unreasonable ones.","In fact, you put up with whoever enslaves you, whoever devours your possessions, whoever grabs what you have, whoever exalts himself over you, and whoever strikes you in the face.","I say this to our dishonor, since it may seem that we have acted in weakness.","Are they Hebrews? I am one also. Are they Israelites? I am one also. Are they Abraham’s offspring?  I am also.","Are they ministers of Christ? I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one: I have done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings, and experienced many near-deaths.","Five times I received 40 strokes less one from the Jews,","three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck, a night and a day I have spent in the open sea;","in journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers,","in labor and toil, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, frequently without food, in cold and lacking clothing.","Besides those things of an external kind, there is what rushes in on me from day to day:  the anxiety for all the congregations.","Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I am not incensed?","If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.","The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, the One who is to be praised forever, knows I am not lying.","In Damascus the governor under A·reʹtas the king was guarding the city of the Dam·a·scenesʹ to seize me,","but I was lowered in a basket  through a window in the city wall, and I escaped his hands."],["I have to boast. It is not beneficial, but I will move on to supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord.","I know a man in union with Christ who, 14 years ago—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know; God knows—was caught away to the third heaven.","Yes, I know such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows—","who was caught away into paradise and heard words that cannot be spoken and that are not lawful for a man to say.","I will boast about such a man, but I will not boast about myself except of my weaknesses.","For even if I want to boast, I will not be unreasonable, for I would say the truth.  But I refrain from doing so, in order that no one should give me more credit than what he sees in me or hears from me,","just because of receiving such extraordinary revelations.","Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it would depart from me.","But he said to me: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you, for my power is being made perfect in weakness.” Most gladly, then, I will boast about my weaknesses, in order that the power of the Christ may remain over me like a tent.","So I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in times of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.","I have become unreasonable. You compelled me to, for I ought to have been recommended by you. For I did not prove to be inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing, even if I am nothing.","Indeed, the signs of an apostle were produced among you with great endurance, and by signs and wonders  and powerful works.","For how were you less favored than the rest of the congregations, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Kindly forgive me for this wrong.","Look! This is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not become a burden. For I am seeking, not your possessions, but you; for the children are not expected to save up for their parents, but the parents for their children.","For my part, I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for you.  If I love you so much more, am I to be loved the less?","But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, you say I was “crafty” and I caught you “by trickery.”","I did not take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you, did I?","I urged Titus and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you at all, did he? We walked in the same spirit, did we not? In the same footsteps, did we not?","Have you been thinking all along that we have been making our defense to you? It is before God that we are speaking in union with Christ. But, beloved ones, all that we do is to build you up.","For I am afraid that somehow when I arrive, I may not find you as I wish and I may not be as you wish, but instead, there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, dissension, backbiting, whispering,  being puffed up with pride, and disorder.","Perhaps when I come again, my God might humiliate me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who previously sinned but have not repented of their uncleanness and sexual immorality  and brazen conduct  that they have practiced."],["This is the third time I am coming to you. “On the testimony  of two or three witnesses every matter must be established.”","Although I am absent now, it is as if I were present for the second time, and I give my warning in advance to those who sinned previously and  to all the rest, that if ever I come again I will not spare them,","since you are seeking proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you but strong among you, is really speaking through me.","For, indeed, he was executed on the stake because of weakness, but he is alive because of God’s power. True, we also are weak with him, but we will live together with him because of God’s power toward you.","Keep testing whether you are in the faith; keep proving what you yourselves are.

And this is what we are praying for, your being readjusted.","That is why I write these things while absent, so that when I am present, I may not have to be severe in using the authority that the Lord gave me, to build up and not to tear down.","Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be comforted, to think in agreement, to live peaceably; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.","Greet one another with a holy kiss.","All the holy ones send you their greetings.","The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the sharing in the holy spirit be with all of you."]],"Galatians":[["Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead,","and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Ga·laʹti·a:","May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","He gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from the present wicked system of things  according to the will of our God and Father,","to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.","I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away  from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness to another sort of good news.","Not that there is another good news; but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to distort the good news about the Christ.","However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you, let him be accursed.","As we have said before, I now say again, Whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed.","Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave.","For I want you to know, brothers, that the good news I declared to you is not of human origin;","for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through a revelation by Jesus Christ.","Of course, you heard about my conduct formerly in Juʹda·ism, that I kept intensely  persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it;","and I was making greater progress in Juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my nation, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.","But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, thought good","to reveal his Son through me so that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not immediately consult with any human;","nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.","Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Ceʹphas,  and I stayed with him for 15 days.","But I did not see any of the other apostles, only James the brother of the Lord.","Now regarding the things I am writing you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.","After that I went into the regions of Syria and Ci·liʹcia.","But I was personally unknown to the congregations of Ju·deʹa that were in union with Christ.","They only used to hear: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.”","So they began glorifying God because of me."],["Then after 14 years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barʹna·bas, also taking Titus along with me.","I went up as a result of a revelation, and I presented to them the good news that I am preaching among  the nations. This was done privately, however, before the men who were highly regarded, to make sure that I was not running or had not run in vain.","Nevertheless, not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek.","But that matter came up because of the false brothers brought in quietly, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we enjoy in union with Christ Jesus, so that they might completely enslave us;","we did not yield in submission to them, no, not for a moment,  so that the truth of the good news might continue with you.","But regarding those who seemed to be important—whatever they were makes no difference to me, for God does not go by a man’s outward appearance—those highly regarded men imparted nothing new to me.","On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter had been for those who are circumcised—","for the one who empowered Peter for an apostleship to those who are circumcised also empowered me for those who are of the nations—","and when they recognized the undeserved kindness that was given me, James and Ceʹphas  and John, the ones who seemed to be pillars, gave Barʹna·bas and me the right hand of fellowship,  so that we should go to the nations but they to those who are circumcised.","They asked only that we keep the poor in mind, and this I have also earnestly endeavored to do.","However, when Ceʹphas  came to Antioch, I resisted  him face-to-face, because he was clearly in the wrong.","For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with people of the nations; but when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcised class.","The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense,  so that even Barʹna·bas was led along with them in their pretense.","But when I saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news, I said to Ceʹphas  before them all: “If you, though you are a Jew, live as the nations do and not as Jews do, how can you compel people of the nations to live according to Jewish practice?”","We who are Jews by birth, and not sinners from the nations,","recognize that a man is declared righteous, not by works of law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. So we have put our faith in Christ Jesus, so that we may be declared righteous by faith in Christ and not by works of law, for no one  will be declared righteous by works of law.","Now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ, is Christ then sin’s minister? Certainly not!","If the very things that I once tore down I build up again, I demonstrate that I am a transgressor.","For through law I died toward law, so that I might become alive toward God.","I am nailed to the stake along with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who is living in union with me. Indeed, the life that I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and handed  himself over for me.","I do not reject  the undeserved kindness of God, for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing."],["O senseless Ga·laʹtians! Who has brought you under this evil influence, you who had Jesus Christ openly portrayed before you as nailed to the stake?","This one thing I want to ask  you: Did you receive the spirit through works of law or because of faith in what you heard?","Are you so senseless? After starting on a spiritual course,  are you finishing on a fleshly course?","Did you undergo so many sufferings for nothing? If it really was for nothing.","Therefore, does the one who supplies you the spirit and performs powerful works among you do it because of your works of law or because of your faith in what you heard?","Just as Abraham “put faith in Jehovah,  and it was counted to him as righteousness.”","Surely you know that it is those who adhere to faith who are sons of Abraham.","Now the scripture, foreseeing that God would declare people of the nations righteous through faith, declared the good news beforehand to Abraham, namely: “By means of you all the nations will be blessed.”","So those who adhere to faith are being blessed together with Abraham, who had faith.","All those who depend on works of law are under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things written in the scroll of the Law by doing them.”","Moreover, it is evident that by law no one is declared righteous with God, because “the righteous one will live by reason of faith.”","Now the Law is not based on faith. Rather, “anyone who does these things will live by means of them.”","Christ purchased us, releasing us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: “Accursed is every man hung upon a stake.”","This was so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the nations by means of Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith.","Brothers, I speak using a human illustration: Once a covenant is validated, even if only by a man, no one annuls it or attaches additions to it.","Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.  It does not say, “and to your descendants,”  in the sense of many. Rather, it says, “and to your offspring,”  in the sense of one, who is Christ.","Further, I say this: The Law, which came into being 430 years later, does not invalidate the covenant previously made by God, so as to abolish the promise.","For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has kindly given it to Abraham through a promise.","Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the offspring  should arrive to whom the promise had been made; and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator.","Now there is no mediator when just one person is involved, but God is only one.","Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? Certainly  not! For if a law had been given that could give life, righteousness would actually have been by means of law.","But the Scripture handed all things over to the custody of sin, so that the promise resulting from faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith.","However, before the faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being handed over into custody, looking to the faith that was about to be revealed.","So the Law became our guardian  leading to Christ, so that we might be declared righteous through faith.","But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a guardian.","You are all, in fact, sons of God through your faith in Christ Jesus.","For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.","There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in union with Christ Jesus.","Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s offspring,  heirs with reference to a promise."],["Now I say that as long as the heir is a young child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the lord of all things,","but he is under supervisors and stewards until the day set ahead of time by his father.","Likewise, we too, when we were children, were enslaved by the elementary things of the world.","But when the full limit of the time arrived, God sent his Son, who was born of a woman and who was under law,","that he might release by purchase those under law, so that we might receive the adoption as sons.","Now because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, and it cries out:  “Abba,  Father!”","So you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, then you are also an heir through God.","Nevertheless, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who are not really gods.","But now that you have come to know God or, rather, have come to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again?","You are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years.","I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.","Brothers, I beg you, become as I am, because I also used to be as you are. You did me no wrong.","But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I had my first opportunity to declare the good news to you.","And though my physical condition was a trial for you, you did not treat me with contempt or disgust;  but you received me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.","Where is that happiness you had? For I bear you witness that, if it had been possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.","So, then, have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?","They are zealous to win you over, but not for a good purpose; they want to alienate you from me, so that you may be eager to follow them.","However, it is always fine for someone to seek zealously after you for a good purpose and not just when I am present with you,","my little children, for whom I am again experiencing birth pains until Christ is formed  in you.","I wish I could be present with you just now and speak in a different way, because I am perplexed over you.","Tell me, you who want to be under law, Do you not hear the Law?","For example, it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant girl and one by the free woman;","but the one by the servant girl was actually born through natural descent  and the other by the free woman through a promise.","These things may be taken as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from Mount Siʹnai, which bears children for slavery and which is Haʹgar.","Now Haʹgar means Siʹnai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children.","But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.","For it is written: “Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break into joyful shouting, you woman who does not have birth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.”","Now you, brothers, are children of the promise the same as Isaac was.","But just as then the one born through natural descent  began persecuting the one born through spirit, so also now.","Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? “Drive out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will by no means be an heir with the son of the free woman.”","So, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman."],["For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore, stand firm, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.","See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.","Again I bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.","You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law; you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness.","For our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith.","For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value, but faith operating through love is.","You were running well. Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?","This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you.","A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough.","I am confident that you who are in union with the Lord will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble, whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves.","As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the torture stake  has been eliminated.","I wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves.","You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity  to pursue fleshly desires, but through love slave for one another.","For the entire Law has been fulfilled  in one commandment, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”","If, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.","But I say, Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.","For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do.","Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law.","Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality,  uncleanness, brazen conduct,","idolatry, spiritism,  hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects,","envy, drunkenness, wild parties,  and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.","On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faith,","mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.","Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires.","If we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit.","Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another."],["Brothers, even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness. But keep an eye on yourself, for fear you too may be tempted.","Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and in this way you will fulfill the law of the Christ.","For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving himself.","But let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.","For each one will carry his own load.","Moreover, let anyone who is being taught  the word share in all good things with the one who gives such teaching.","Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap;","because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.","So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.","So, then, as long as we have the opportunity,  let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.","See with what large letters I have written you with my own hand.","All those who want to make a good impression in the flesh  are the ones who try to compel you to get circumcised, doing so only to avoid being persecuted for the torture stake  of the Christ.","For even those who are getting circumcised do not keep the Law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may have cause for boasting about your flesh.","But may I never boast, except in the torture stake  of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been put to death  with regard to me and I with regard to the world.","For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation is.","As for all those who walk orderly by this rule of conduct, peace and mercy be upon them, yes, upon the Israel of God.","From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of Jesus.","The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show, brothers.

And after he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.","So he has become better than the angels to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.","For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”? And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”?","But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.”","Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers  a flame of fire.”","But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness.","You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.”","And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands.","They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out,","and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.”","But about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?","Are they not all spirits for holy service,  sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?"],["That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard, so that we never drift away.","For if the word spoken through angels proved to be sure, and every transgression and disobedient act received a punishment in harmony with justice,","how will we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation? For it began to be spoken through our Lord  and was verified for us by those who heard him,","while God joined in bearing witness with signs and wonders  and various powerful works and with the holy spirit distributed according to his will.","For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come, about which we are speaking.","But in one place a certain witness said: “What is man that you keep him in mind, or a son of man that you take care of him?","You made him a little lower than angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and appointed him over the works of your hands.","All things you subjected under his feet.” By subjecting all things to him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him.","But we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than angels, now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, so that by God’s undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone.","For it was fitting that the one for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings.","For both the one who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all stem from one, and for this reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,","as he says: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you with song.”","And again: “I will put my trust in him.” And again: “Look! I and the young children, whom Jehovah  gave me.”","Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly shared in the same things, so that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil,","and that he might set free  all those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death.","For it is not really angels he is assisting, but he is assisting Abraham’s offspring.","Consequently, he had to become like his “brothers” in all respects, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice  for the sins of the people.","Since he himself has suffered when being put to the test, he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test."],["Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling,  consider the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge —Jesus.","He was faithful to the One who appointed him, just as Moses also was in all the house of that One.","For he  is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, since the one who constructs a house has more honor than the house itself.","Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.","Now Moses was faithful as an attendant in all the house of that One as a testimony  of the things that were to be spoken afterward,","but Christ was faithful as a son over God’s house. We are His house if, indeed,  we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end.","Therefore, just as the holy spirit says, “Today if you listen to his voice,","do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,","where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years.","This is why I became disgusted with this generation and said: ‘They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.’","So I swore in my anger: ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”","Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God;","but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin.","For we actually become partakers of  the Christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning.","As it is said, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.”","For who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? Was it not, in fact, all those who went out of Egypt under Moses?","Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?","And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who acted disobediently?","So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith."],["Therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard  for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it.","For we have also had the good news declared to us, just as they had; but the word that they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.","For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: “So I swore in my anger, ‘They will not enter into my rest,’” although his works were finished from the founding of the world.","For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”","and here again he says: “They will not enter into my rest.”","Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,","he again marks off a certain day by saying long afterward in David’s psalm, “Today”; just as it has been said above, “Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.”","For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward have spoken of another day.","So there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God.","For the man who has entered into God’s rest has also rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.","Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience.","For the word of God is alive and exerts power and  is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul  and spirit,  and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.","And there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.","Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on to our public declaration of him.","For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin.","Let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech, so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time."],["For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in their behalf over the things relating to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.","He is able to deal compassionately  with the ignorant and erring  ones, since he too is confronted with  his own weakness,","and because of that he must make offerings for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.","A man does not take this honor of his own accord, but he receives it only when he is called by God, just as Aaron was.","So, too, the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by the One who said to him: “You are my son; today I have become your father.”","As he also says in another place, “You are a priest forever in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek.”","During his life on earth,  Christ offered up supplications and also petitions, with strong outcries and tears, to the One who was able to save him out of death, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.","Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.","And after he had been made perfect, he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him,","because he has been designated by God a high priest in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek.","We have much to say about him, and it is difficult to explain, because you have become dull in your hearing.","For although by now  you should be teachers, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God, and you have gone back to needing milk, not solid food.","For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a young child.","But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment  trained to distinguish both right and wrong."],["Therefore, now that we have moved beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works and faith in God,","the teaching on  baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment.","And this we will do, if God indeed permits.","For as regards those who were once enlightened and who have tasted the heavenly free gift and who have become partakers of holy spirit","and who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things,","but have fallen away, it is impossible to revive them again to repentance, because they nail the Son of God to the stake again for themselves and expose him to public shame.","For the ground receives a blessing from God when it drinks in the rain that frequently falls on it and then produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated.","But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed, and in the end it will be burned.","But in your case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things, things related to salvation, even though we are speaking in this way.","For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.","But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end,","so that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.","For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,","saying: “I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.”","So after Abraham had shown patience, he obtained this promise.","For men swear by someone greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, since it is a legal guarantee to them.","In this same way, when God decided to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose,  he guaranteed it  with an oath,","in order that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to take firm hold of the hope set before us.","We have this hope as an anchor for the soul,  both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain,","where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, Jesus, who has become a high priest in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek forever."],["For this Mel·chizʹe·dek, king of Saʹlem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","and Abraham gave  him a tenth of everything. First, his name is translated “King of Righteousness,” and then also king of Saʹlem, that is, “King of Peace.”","In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time.","See how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head,  gave a tenth out of the best spoils.","True, according to the Law, those of the sons of  Leʹvi who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though these are descendants  of Abraham.","But this man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.","Now it is undeniable that the lesser one is blessed by the greater.","And in the one case, it is men who are dying who receive tithes, but in the other case, it is someone of whom witness is given that he lives.","And it could be said that even Leʹvi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham,","for he was still a future descendant  of his forefather when Mel·chizʹe·dek met him.","If, then, perfection was attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for it was a feature of the Law that was given to the people), what further need would there be for another priest to arise who is said to be in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek and not in the manner of Aaron?","For since the priesthood is being changed, it becomes necessary to change the Law as well.","For the man about whom these things are said came from another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.","For it is clear that our Lord has descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.","And this becomes even clearer when another priest arises who is like Mel·chizʹe·dek,","who has become such, not by the legal requirement that depends on fleshly descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.","For it is said in witness of him: “You are a priest forever in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek.”","So, then, the former commandment is set aside because it is weak and ineffective.","For the Law made nothing perfect, but the introduction of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God.","Also, inasmuch as this was not done without an oath being sworn","(for, indeed, there are men who have become priests without a sworn oath, but this one has become so through an oath sworn respecting him by the One who said: “Jehovah  has sworn, and he will not change his mind,  ‘You are a priest forever’”),","Jesus has accordingly become the guarantee  of a better covenant.","Furthermore, many had to become priests in succession because death prevented them from continuing as such,","but because he continues alive forever, his priesthood has no successors.","So he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.","For it is fitting for us to have such a high priest who is loyal, innocent, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and exalted above the heavens.","Unlike those high priests, he does not need to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, because he did this once for all time when he offered himself up.","For the Law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses, but the word of the oath sworn after  the Law appoints a Son, who has been made perfect forever."],["Now this is the main point of what we are saying: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,","a minister  of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah  set up, and not man.","For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.","If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law.","These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: For He says: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”","But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry  because he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established on better promises.","If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.","For he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! The days are coming,’ says Jehovah,  ‘when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant.","It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.","“‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah.  ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. And I will become their God, and they will become my people.","“‘And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!”  For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them.","For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.’”","In his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete. Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away."],["For its part, the former covenant used to have legal requirements for sacred service and its holy place on earth.","For a first tent compartment was constructed, in which were the lampstand and the table and the display of the loaves of presentation;  and it is called the Holy Place.","But behind the second curtain was the tent compartment called the Most Holy.","This had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant completely overlaid with gold, in which were the golden jar containing the manna and Aaron’s rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant;","and above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory cover.  But now is not the time to speak of these things in detail.","After these things were constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent compartment  regularly to perform the sacred services;","but the high priest enters alone into the second compartment once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins that the people committed in ignorance.","Thus the holy spirit makes it clear that the way into the holy place had not yet been revealed while the first tent was standing.","This tent is an illustration for the present time, and according to this arrangement, both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the conscience of the man doing sacred service perfect.","They have to do only with foods and drinks and various ceremonial washings.  They were legal requirements concerning the body and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight.","However, when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have already taken place, he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.","He entered into the holy place, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time, and obtained an everlasting deliverance  for us.","For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer  sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies for the cleansing of the flesh,","how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may render sacred service to the living God?","That is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that because a death has occurred for their release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.","For where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be established,","because a covenant is valid at death, since it is not in force as long as the human covenanter is living.","Consequently, neither was the former covenant put into effect  without blood.","For when Moses had spoken every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book  and all the people,","saying: “This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to keep.”","He likewise sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the holy service  with the blood.","Yes, according to the Law nearly all things are cleansed with blood, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.","Therefore, it was necessary for the typical representations of the things in the heavens to be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things require far better sacrifices.","For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, so that he now appears before  God on our behalf.","This was not done to offer himself often, as when the high priest enters into the  holy place from year to year with blood that is not his own.","Otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things  to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself.","And just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this to receive a judgment,","so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin,  and he will be seen by those earnestly looking for him for their salvation."],["For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, it  can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make those who approach perfect.","Otherwise, would not the sacrifices have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service once cleansed would have no consciousness of sins anymore?","On the contrary, these sacrifices are a reminder of sins year after year,","for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.","So when he comes into the world, he says: “‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.","You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.’","Then I said: ‘Look! I have come (in the scroll  it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’”","After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings”—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law—","then he says: “Look! I have come to do your will.” He does away with what is first in order to establish what is second.","By this “will” we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.","Also, every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service  and to make the same sacrifices often, which can never take sins away completely.","But this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of God,","from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet.","For it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect for all time.","Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said:","“‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says Jehovah.  ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them.’”","Then it says: “And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind.”","Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.","Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness  for the way of entry into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,","which he opened up  for us as a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,","and since we have a great priest over the house of God,","let us approach with sincere hearts  and complete faith, having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience and our bodies bathed with clean water.","Let us hold firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful.","And let us consider  one another so as to incite  to love and fine works,","not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.","For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left,","but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a burning indignation that is going to consume those in opposition.","Anyone who has disregarded the Law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three.","How much greater punishment do you think a person will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God and who has regarded as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt?","For we know the One who said: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again: “Jehovah  will judge his people.”","It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.","However, keep remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle along with sufferings.","At times you were publicly exposed  both to reproaches and to tribulations, and at times you shared  with those who were having such an experience.","For you expressed sympathy for those in prison and you accepted joyfully the plundering of your belongings, knowing that you yourselves have a better and an enduring possession.","Therefore, do not throw away your boldness,  which will be richly rewarded.","For you need endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.","For yet “a very little while,” and “the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.”","“But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,” and “if he shrinks back, I have  no pleasure in him.”","Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction, but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives."],["Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration  of realities that are not seen.","For by means of it, the men of ancient times  had witness borne to them.","By faith we perceive that the systems of things  were put in order by God’s word, so that what is seen has come into existence from things that are not visible.","By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain, and through that faith he received the witness that he was righteous, for God approved  his gifts, and although  he died, he still speaks through his faith.","By faith Eʹnoch was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him; for before he was transferred he received the witness that he had pleased God well.","Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is  and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.","By faith Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this faith he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.","By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, although not knowing where he was going.","By faith he lived as a foreigner in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise.","For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, whose designer  and builder is God.","By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring,  even when she was past the age, since she considered Him faithful  who made the promise.","For this reason, from one man who was as good as dead, there were born children, as many as the stars of heaven in number and as innumerable as the sands by the seaside.","In faith all of these died, although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises; but they saw them from a distance and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.","For those who speak in such a way make it evident that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own.","And yet, if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed, they would have had opportunity to return.","But now they are reaching out for a better place, that is, one belonging to heaven. Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, to be called on as their God, for he has prepared a city for them.","By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac—the man who had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son—","although it had been said to him: “What will be called your offspring  will be through Isaac.”","But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.","By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Eʹsau concerning things to come.","By faith Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped while leaning on the top of his staff.","By faith Joseph, nearing his end, spoke of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and he gave instructions  concerning his bones.","By faith Moses was hid by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that the young child was  beautiful and they did not fear the order of the king.","By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharʹaoh’s daughter,","choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,","because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.","By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.","By faith he observed the Passover and the splashing of the blood, so that the destroyer might not harm  their firstborn.","By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted it, they were swallowed up.","By faith the walls of Jerʹi·cho fell down after the people had marched around them for seven days.","By faith Raʹhab the prostitute did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way.","And what more will I say? For time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gidʹe·on, Baʹrak, Samson, Jephʹthah, David, as well as Samuel and the other prophets.","Through faith they defeated kingdoms, brought about righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,","quenched the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from a weak state were made powerful, became mighty in war, routed invading armies.","Women received their dead by resurrection, but other men were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection.","Yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by chains and prisons.","They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn in two,  they were slaughtered by the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while they were in need, in tribulation, mistreated;","and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves and dens of the earth.","And yet all of these, although they received a favorable witness because of their faith, did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise,","because God had foreseen something better for us, so that they might not be made perfect apart from us."],["So, then, because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,","as we look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake,  despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.","Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners against their own interests, so that you may not get tired and give up.","In your struggle against that sin, you have never yet resisted to the point of having  your blood shed.","And you have entirely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: “My son, do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah,  nor give up when you are corrected by him;","for those whom Jehovah  loves he disciplines, in fact, he scourges  everyone whom he receives as a son.”","You need to endure as part of your discipline.  God is treating you as sons.

For if those who  refused to listen to the one giving divine warning on earth did not escape, how much more will we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens!","At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised: “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”","Now the expression “yet once more” indicates the removal of the things that are shaken, things that have been made, in order that the things not shaken may remain.","Therefore, seeing that we are to receive a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to receive undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe.","For our God is a consuming fire."],["Let your brotherly love continue.","Do not forget hospitality,  for through it some unknowingly entertained angels.","Keep in mind those in prison,  as though you were imprisoned with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body.","Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge sexually immoral people  and adulterers.","Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.

It is concerning that sin that I do not tell him to make request.","All unrighteousness is sin, and yet there is a sin that does not incur death.","We know that everyone who has been born from God does not practice sin, but the one born from God  watches him, and the wicked one cannot take hold of him.","We know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.","But we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us insight  so that we may gain the knowledge of the one who is true. And we are in union with the one who is true, by means of his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and life everlasting.","Little children, guard yourselves from idols."]],"Revelation":[["A revelation  by Jesus Christ, which God gave him, to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place.

Let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”","In response one of the elders said to me: “These who are dressed in the white robes, who  are they and where did they come from?”","So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one who knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.","That is why they are before the throne of God, and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them.","They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat,","because the Lamb, who is in the midst  of the throne, will shepherd them and will guide them to springs  of waters of life.

And there were thunders and voices and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.","And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.","The first one blew his trumpet. And there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green vegetation was burned up.","The second angel blew his trumpet. And something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. And a third of the sea became blood;","and a third of the living creatures  in the sea died, and a third of the ships were wrecked.","The third angel blew his trumpet.

And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the people died from the waters, because these had been made bitter.","The fourth angel blew his trumpet. And a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not have light for a third of it, and the night likewise.","And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: “Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!”"],["The fifth angel blew his trumpet.

And their teeth were like those of lions,","and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle.","Also, they have tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails is their authority to hurt the people for five months.","They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is A·badʹdon,  but in Greek he has the name A·polʹlyon.","The one woe is past. Look! Two more woes are coming after these things.","The sixth angel blew his trumpet.

He said to me: “Take it and eat it up, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.”","I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.","And they said to me: “You must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues  and many kings.”"],["And a reed like a rod  was given to me as he said: “Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshipping in it.","But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, leave it out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for 42 months.","I will cause my two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days dressed in sackcloth.”","These are symbolized by the two olive trees and the two lampstands and are standing before the Lord of the earth.","If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone should want to harm them, this is how he must be killed.","These have the authority to shut up the sky  so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish.","When they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will wage war with them and conquer them and kill them.","And their corpses will be on the main street of the great city that is in a spiritual sense called Sodʹom and Egypt, where their Lord was also executed on the stake.","And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues  and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb.","And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.","After the three and a half days, spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them.","And they heard a loud voice  from heaven say to them: “Come up here.” And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.","In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; and 7,000 persons were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.","The second woe is past.

A great fiery-colored dragon, with seven heads and ten horns and on its heads seven diadems;","and its tail drags a third of the stars of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth.

And her child was snatched  away to God and to his throne.","And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God and where they would feed her for 1,260 days.","And war broke out in heaven: Miʹcha·el  and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled","but they did not prevail,  nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven.","So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.","I heard a loud voice in heaven say:","And they conquered him because  of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing, and they did not love their souls  even in the face of death.","On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.”","Now when the dragon saw that it had been hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.","But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be fed for a time and times and half a time  away from the face of the serpent.","And the serpent spewed out water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river.","But the earth came to the woman’s help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon spewed out from its mouth.","So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring,  who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus."],["And it  stood still on the sand of the sea.","Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.","I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration.","And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: “Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?”","It was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for 42 months.","And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to blaspheme his name and his dwelling place, even those residing in heaven.","It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue  and nation.","And all those who dwell on the earth will worship it. From the founding of the world, not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.","If anyone has an ear, let him hear.","If anyone is meant for captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword,  he must be killed with the sword. This is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the holy ones.","Then I saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking like a dragon.","It exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight. And it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first wild beast, whose mortal  wound was healed.","And it performs great signs, even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind.","It misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that it was permitted to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived.","And it was permitted to give breath  to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who refuse to worship the image of the wild beast.","It puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead,","and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.","This is where it calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number,  and its number is 666."],["Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.","I heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was like singers who accompany themselves by playing on their harps.","And they are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000, who have been bought from the earth.","These are the ones who did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones who keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,","and no deceit was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.","And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,  and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue  and people.","He was saying in a loud voice: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of judgment by him has arrived, so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs  of water.”","Another, a second angel, followed, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion  of her sexual immorality!”","Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,","he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.","And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image and whoever  receives the mark of its name.","Here is where it calls for endurance on the part of the holy ones, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.”","And I heard a voice out of heaven say, “Write: Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right  with them.”","Then I saw, and look! a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.","Another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary, calling with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: “Put your sickle in and reap, because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”","And the one seated on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the earth was reaped.","And still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.","And still another angel emerged from the altar, and he had authority over the fire. And he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: “Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes have become ripe.”","The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of God’s anger.","The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia."],["And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.","And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who are victorious over the wild beast and its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God.","They were singing the song of Moses the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, saying:","Who will not really fear you, Jehovah,  and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been revealed.”","After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven,","and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests.","One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.","And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished."],["And I heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary say to the seven angels: “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of God on the earth.”","The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image.","The second one poured out his bowl into the sea. And it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living creature  died, yes, the things in the sea.","The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs  of water. And they became blood.","I heard the angel over the waters say: “You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, for you have issued these judgments,","because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they deserve it.”","And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Jehovah  God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.”","The fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun, and to the sun it was granted to scorch the people with fire.","And the people were scorched by the great heat, but they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give glory to him.","The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast. And its kingdom became darkened, and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain,","but they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.","The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Eu·phraʹtes, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the rising of the sun.","And I saw three unclean inspired expressions  that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.","They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.","“Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments, so that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.”","And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.","The seventh one poured out his bowl on the air. At this a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying: “It has come to pass!”","And there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders, and there was a great earthquake unlike any that had occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive and so great was the earthquake.","The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.","Also, every island fled, and mountains were not found.","Then great hailstones, each about the weight of a talent,  fell from heaven on the people, and the people blasphemed God because  of the plague of hail, for the plague was unusually great."],["One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me: “Come, I will show you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many waters,","with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality,  and earth’s inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.”","And he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns.","The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, and she had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality.","On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth.”","And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.","So the angel said to me: “Why is it that you were amazed? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns:","The wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss, and it is to go off into destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth—those whose names have not been written in the scroll of life from the founding of the world—will be amazed when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present.","“This calls for a mind  that has wisdom: The seven heads mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top.","And there are seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived; but when he does arrive, he must remain a short while.","And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also an eighth king, but it springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction.","“The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast.","These have one thought, so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.","These will battle with the Lamb, but because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.”","He said to me: “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.","And the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.","For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought, yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, until the words of God will have been accomplished.","And the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.”"],["After this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.","And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a place where every unclean spirit  and every unclean and hated bird lurks!","For because of the wine of the passion  of her sexual immorality,  all the nations have fallen victim, and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants  of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury.”","And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.","For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice  to mind.","Repay her in the way she treated others, yes, pay her back double for the things she has done; in the cup she has mixed, mix a double portion for her.","To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For she keeps saying in her heart: ‘I sit as queen, and I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.’","That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah  God, who judged her, is strong.","“And the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality  with her and lived with her in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her when they see the smoke from her burning.","They will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say: ‘Too bad, too bad, you great city, Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’","“Also, the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full cargo anymore,","a full cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; and everything made from scented wood; and every sort of object made from ivory, and from precious wood, copper, iron, and marble;","also cinnamon, Indian spice, incense, perfumed oil, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives.","Yes, the fine fruit that you  desired has left you, and all the delicacies and the splendid things have vanished from you, never to be found again.","“The merchants who sold these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn,","saying: ‘Too bad, too bad, the great city, clothed with fine linen, purple, and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls,","because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’","and cried out as they looked at the smoke from her burning  and said: ‘What city is like the great city?’","They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said: ‘Too bad, too bad, the great city, in which all those who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because in one hour she has been devastated!’","“Be glad over her, O heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf!”","And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.","And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp, of musicians, of flutists, and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again. And no craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again.","No light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; for your merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, and by your spiritistic practices all the nations were misled.","Yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”"],["After this I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah!  The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,","because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality,  and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.”","And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah!  And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.”","And the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne and said: “Amen! Praise Jah!”","Also, a voice came from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.”","And I heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah,  because Jehovah  our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king!","Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.","Yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.”","And he tells me, “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.”","At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning Jesus. Worship God! For the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy.”","I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse. And the  one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness.","His eyes are a fiery flame, and on his head are many diadems.  He has a name written that no one knows but he himself,","and he is clothed with an outer garment stained  with blood, and he is called by the name The Word of God.","Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.","And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.","On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.","I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven:  “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God,","so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them, and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.”","And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.","And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.","But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh."],["And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.","He seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years.","And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended. After this he must be released for a little while.","And I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. Yes, I saw the souls  of those executed  for the witness they gave about Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had not worshipped the wild beast or its image and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years.","(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.","Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years.","Now as soon as the 1,000 years have ended, Satan will be released from his prison,","and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Maʹgog, to gather  them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea.","And they advanced over the whole earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and consumed them.","And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were; and they will be tormented  day and night forever and ever.","And I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.","And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.","And the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and the Grave  gave up the dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.","And death and the Grave  were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.","Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire."],["And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more.","I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.","With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them.","And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”","And the One seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new.” Also he says: “Write, for these words are faithful  and true.”","And he said to me: “They have come to pass! I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,  the beginning and the end. To anyone thirsting I will give from the spring  of the water of life free.","Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son.","But as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and the sexually immoral  and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This means the second death.”","One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls that were full of the seven last plagues came and said to me: “Come, and I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”","So he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God","and having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone shining crystal clear.","It had a great  and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.","On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.","The wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones, and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.","Now the one who was speaking with me was holding a golden reed as a measure in order to measure the city and its gates and its wall.","And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as its width. And he measured the city with the reed, 12,000 stadia;  its length and width and height are equal.","He also measured its wall, 144 cubits  according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s measure.","Now the wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.","The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chal·ceʹdo·ny, the fourth emerald,","the fifth sar·donʹyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysʹo·lite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysʹo·prase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst.","Also, the 12 gates were 12 pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. And the main street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.","I did not see a temple in it, for Jehovah  God the Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb is.","And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp was the Lamb.","And the nations will walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.","Its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there.","And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.","But anything defiled and anyone who does what is disgusting and deceitful will in no way enter into it; only those written in the Lamb’s scroll of life will enter."],["And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb","down the middle of its main street. On both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their fruit each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.","And there will no longer be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will offer him sacred service;","and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.","Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for Jehovah  God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever.","He said to me: “These words are faithful  and true; yes, Jehovah,  the God who inspired the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place.","Look! I am coming quickly. Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.”","Well I, John, was the one hearing and seeing these things.  When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.","But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.”","He also tells me: “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near.","Let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness, and let the filthy one continue in his filth; but let the righteous one continue in righteousness, and let the holy one continue in holiness.","“‘Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to repay each one according to his work.","I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,  the first and the last, the beginning and the end.","Happy are those who wash their robes, so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates.","Outside are the dogs  and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral  and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying.’","“‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to you about these things for the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright morning star.’”","And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, “Come!” and let anyone hearing say, “Come!” and let anyone thirsting come; let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.","“I am bearing witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll;","and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take his portion away from the trees of life and out of the holy city, things that are written about in this scroll.","“The one who bears witness of these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming quickly.’”","May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with the holy ones."]]}
